  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You inscribe an angular rune upon the surface of a weapon, increasing
      its hit points. A weapon that bears this rune multiplies its hit points by
      2, as if it were one size category larger than it actually is. Placing
      more than one rune of this type on a weapon has no effect.</p>
