  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent gains a familiar as the familiar option of
      the wizard’s arcane bond class feature. This ability functions exactly
      like that part of the class feature, but the rogue’s effective wizard
      level is her rogue level –4. The rogue must have the minor magic and major
      magic talents before she can choose this trick.</p>
