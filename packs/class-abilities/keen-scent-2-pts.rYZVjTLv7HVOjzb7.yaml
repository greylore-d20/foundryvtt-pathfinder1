  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon's sense of smell becomes even more acute. The eidolon can
      notice other creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can
      detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.</p>

      <p>The eidolon must possess the gills and scent evolutions to take this
      evolution.</p>
