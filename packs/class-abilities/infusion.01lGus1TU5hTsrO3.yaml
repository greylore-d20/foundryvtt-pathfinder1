  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra
      bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after
      the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to
      occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An infused extract can
      be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.</p>
