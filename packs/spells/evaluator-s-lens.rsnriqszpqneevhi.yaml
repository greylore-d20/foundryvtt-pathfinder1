  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon an insubstantial lens of force 4 inches in diameter that
      hovers in front of your face. When you attempt a saving throw against a
      spell with the figment or pattern descriptor, you can roll twice and take
      the higher result. You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on Appraise checks to
      appraise the worth of an item viewed through the lens, and you never judge
      an item's value wildly inaccurately. If you successfully identify that the
      item has magical properties, you can immediately attempt a Spellcraft
      check to determine the item's properties, as if you had cast <i>detect
      magic</i> on the item and examined it for 3 rounds. This spell cannot
      determine the properties of artifacts.  The lens cannot be targeted or
      harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>,
      or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. The lens's AC against touch
      attacks is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
