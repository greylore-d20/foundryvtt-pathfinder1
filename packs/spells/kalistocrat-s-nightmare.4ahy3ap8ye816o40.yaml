    value: >-
      <p>You temporarily curse a creature so its touch lessens the value of
      coins it touches. While under the effects of this curse, whenever the
      target touches a coin of higher value than copper piece, that coin changes
      into a copper piece. The change takes place over the course of the
      following minute, allowing the target to interact with multiple coins
      before the effect of the curse becomes apparent. The affected coins are
      permanently transmuted from their previous material (typically gold or
      silver) into copper coins, though <i>remove curse</i> (which can affect up
      to 50 coins with a single casting) or a similar spell can restore them to
      their previous material.</p>
