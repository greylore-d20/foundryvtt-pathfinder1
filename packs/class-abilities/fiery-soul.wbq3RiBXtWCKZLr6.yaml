      <p>The shaman gains fire resistance 10. In addition, as a standard action
      she can unleash a 15-foot cone of flame from her mouth, dealing 1d4 points
      of fire damage per shaman level she possesses. A successful Reflex saving
      throw halves this damage.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait
      1d4 rounds between each use.</p>
