      <p>You bestow divine protection on your companion. The target gains spell
      resistance equal to 5 plus half your caster level against spells and
      spell-like effects produced by evil creatures. The target also gains a +1
      sacred bonus on saving throws and DR 5/evil or silver. Creatures under the
      effects of this spell often take on a celestial appearance, such as golden
      feathers or a radiant aura, but they are not truly celestial
      creatures.</p>
