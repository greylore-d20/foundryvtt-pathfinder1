      <p>This spell creates an unearthly and infectious song that seductively
      summons all who hear it. Nixie's lure affects a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of
      creatures. Creatures in the area who fail their saves are lured by the
      song and move toward you using the most direct means available. If the
      path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff,
      the creatures each receive a second saving throw to end the effect before
      moving into peril. Creatures lured by the spell's song can take no actions
      other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of you simply
      stands still and for the duration of the spell remains fascinated.</p>
