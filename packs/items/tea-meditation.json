For 10 minutes after drinking the tea, you gain a +2 <em>alchemical bonus</em> against <em>mind-affecting</em> effects. If you drink meditation tea while suffering from a <em>mind-affecting</em> affect, you may immediately roll another saving throw (with the +2 bonus) against the effect; you may gain this particular benefit only once per day.</p>"
