      <p>You create a link to a target and can direct pain and damage through
      this link. You take only half damage from effects and attacks that deal
      hit point damage.</p><p>The target of this spell takes the remainder of
      the damage.</p><p>Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as
      charm effects, temporary ability damage, level drain, and death effects
      cannot be shared through this link. If you suffer a reduction in hit
      points because of a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split
      with the target of this spell because it is not hit point damage. When the
      spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and
      you, but damage already split is not reassigned back to you.</p><p>If you
      and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell
      immediately ends.</p>
