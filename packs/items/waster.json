All wasters are designed to emulate a specific melee weapon (such as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/kukri\">kukri</a> waster or a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/greatsword\">greatsword</a> waster), and weigh twice as much as the weapons they emulate.</p>\r\n<p>Using a waster to hone your combat techniques requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a> check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a> to your <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a> against <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuvers</a> targeting weapons you wield that match the waster your practiced with. This bonus lasts for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>Whether it's the heaviest possible plate armor with a tower shield for <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover\">cover</a> or elegant layers of cloth that appear incapable of granting any protection, the right armor for the situation is crucial to a successful melee combatant's preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n"
