  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its
      height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the
      creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2
      size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of
      1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased
      size.</p><p>A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space
      of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the
      target's speed.</p><p>If insufficient room is available for the desired
      growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a
      Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in
      the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials
      enclosing it-the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing
      its size.</p><p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly
      <i>enlarged</i> by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal
      more damage (see page 145). Other magical properties are not affected by
      this spell. Any <i>enlarged</i> item that leaves an <i>enlarged</i>
      creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly
      returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons
      deal their normal damage. Magical properties of <i>enlarged</i> items are
      not increased by this spell.</p><p>Multiple magical effects that increase
      size do not stack.</p><p><i>Enlarge person</i> counters and dispels
      <i>reduce person</i>.</p><p><i>Enlarge person</i> can be made permanent
      with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
