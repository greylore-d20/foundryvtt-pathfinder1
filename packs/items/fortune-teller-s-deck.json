A common deck only has simple drawings on simple wooden plaques. A quality fortune-teller’s deck usually consists of wooden plaques with painted color images; it is suitable as a focus for the&nbsp;augury&nbsp;spell, and provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Profession (fortune-teller), Profession (medium), and similar Profession checks. A masterwork fortuneteller’s deck may be wood, ivory, or even metal, with painted or carved images, and is often highlighted with gold inlays or tiny gems; it has all the benefits of a quality deck, except it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the listed skill checks.</p>"
