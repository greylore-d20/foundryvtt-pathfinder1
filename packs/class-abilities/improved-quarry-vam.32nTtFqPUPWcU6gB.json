He can now select a quarry as a <em>free action</em>, and can now <em>take 20</em> while using <em>Survival</em> to track his quarry while moving at normal speed, without penalty. His <em>insight bonus</em> to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>"
