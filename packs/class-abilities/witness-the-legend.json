This causes the target to shed light like a torch for 1 minute, and while the effect lasts, you can expend a daily use of your touch of glory domain ability as an immediate action to add 1d6 to an attack, saving throw, skill check, or ability check attempted by the target; for a roll to confirm a critical hit or save against a fear effect, you instead add 1d12. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 8th.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Divine Presence power of the Glory Domain.</p>"
