    value: >-
      <p>You pull forth idealized versions of yourself at various ages from your
      mind, splitting into three copies of yourself. <i>Threefold form</i>
      functions as <i>bilocation</i> (Pathfinder <i>RPG Occult Adventures</i>
      158), except there are three of you instead of two, and each of the three
      bodies is under the effect of <i>threefold</i> aspectAPG with a different
      idealized age. Other than the differences from <i>threefold</i> aspect,
      each body shares all other effects with you, as normal for
      <i>bilocation</i>.</p>
