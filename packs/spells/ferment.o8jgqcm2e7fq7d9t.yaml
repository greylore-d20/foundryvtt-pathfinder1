      <p>This spell temporarily imbues a potable liquid (including elixirs,
      extracts, potions, and poisons) with an intoxicant. The caster must
      succeed at a caster level check in order to affect magic liquids and
      poisons (DC = 10 + item level for magic liquids, DC equal to the poison's
      save DC for a poison); otherwise, the spell fails. If the caster succeeds,
      the liquid also assumes a flavor according to what the caster desires, 
      but the effect on the imbiber is the same. An imbiber of a liquid affected
      by <i>ferment</i> must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the spell's
      save DC or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and
      skill checks for the remaining duration of the spell. Additionally, the DC
      of any skill check to identify a magic liquid or poison under the effects
      of this spell increases by 5.</p>
