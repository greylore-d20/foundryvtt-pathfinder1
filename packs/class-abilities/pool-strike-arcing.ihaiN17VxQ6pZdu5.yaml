    value: >-
      <p>The magus can expend 1 additional point from his arcane pool when using
      the pool strike arcana. If his attack hits, the magus can target a number
      of enemies within 15 feet equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 0)
      with a ranged touch attack as a free action. Those struck take the same
      energy damage as the primary target of the pool strike, including
      increased damage on a critical hit.</p>

      <p>The magus must be at least 12th level and must have the pool strike
      magus arcana before selecting this magus arcana.</p>
