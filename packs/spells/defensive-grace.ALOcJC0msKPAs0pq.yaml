  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Each round you can roll an inspiration die without expending a use of
      inspiration and gain the result as a dodge bonus to AC for that round. You
      are immune to precision damage (including the extra damage from the
      precise strike deed, sneak attack, studied combat, and studied
      strike).</p>

      <p> If a critical hit is confirmed against you, you can dismiss this spell
      as an immediate action to negate the critical and make the attack instead
      deal normal damage.</p>
