    value: >-
      <p>You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you
      indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional
      globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of
      5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and
      have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere's
      course.</p><p>If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving
      for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature,
      though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing
      metal armor take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.</p><p>Each globe moves
      as long as you actively direct it (it's a move action for you to direct
      all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they
      stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling
      creatures or move solid objects. A <i>ball lightning</i> globe winks out
      if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>
