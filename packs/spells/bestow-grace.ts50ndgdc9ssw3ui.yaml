      <p>With this spell you can bestow your divine grace on another good
      creature for a short amount of time, infusing that creature with a portion
      of your holy virtue. When you touch the subject, you grant that creature a
      sacred bonus to its saving throws equal to its Charisma bonus (if any) on
      all saving throws.</p>
