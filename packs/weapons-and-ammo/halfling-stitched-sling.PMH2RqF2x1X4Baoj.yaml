  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Technically not a unique kind of weapon, a stitched sling is a sling,
      staff sling, or double sling whose cup is sewn closed around the
      ammunition, creating a weak sort of light flail. The ammunition sewn into
      the sling is irrelevant to the type and amount of damage it causes. A
      stitched sling cannot be used to fire ammunition unless the thread or cord
      holding the cup closed is cut open (a full-round action that provokes
      attacks of opportunity).</p>
