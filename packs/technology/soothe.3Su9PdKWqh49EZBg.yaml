  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This strange, pink, gel-like substance is generally contained in a
      small glass jar that holds 1 dose. A single dose of soothe dulls pain and
      creates a euphoric sensation, particularly when applied to an open wound.
      Rubbing a dose of soothe onto one's skin or imbibing the faintly
      citrusflavored stuff cures 1 point of damage, but rubbing a dose onto a
      wound received in the last minute heals the user of 1d8 points of damage.
      In addition, for the next minute, the user becomes immune to bleed damage
      and gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. As a
      somewhat unusual and disturbing side effect, wounds healed by soothe tend
      to form raw, unsightly scars, giving the appearance of the wound still
      being fresh but disturbingly bloodless. Soothe has a further side
      effect-the stuff is slightly addictive, and those who use it run the
      danger of developing a habit. Soothe's side effect of transforming wounds
      into raw, ugly scar tissue tends to make those who abuse the drug-like
      pharmaceutical increasingly into hideous monstrosities over time. In fact,
      some subcultures, like the Smilers of Scrapwall, use this side effect to
      make themselves appear more ferocious, and openly encourage
      self-mutilation followed by healing via of this strange
      substance.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 20;
