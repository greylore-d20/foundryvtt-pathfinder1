      <p>With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to clear a path
      ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a windstorm (<i>Core
      Rulebook</i> 439). During the first round of the spell, the winds sweep
      the designated area clear of anything  of Small or smaller size, blowing
      it outward to the sides of the spell's effect (50% chance of landing on
      either side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though all
      other creatures are subject to the wind's effects. On the second and all
      later rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a wind
      wall. If the effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds
      create a channel up to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid. On
      your turn as a move action, you can move the effect of this spell, either
      rotating it at one of its ends up to 45 degrees, or moving it up to 50
      feet in line with its current orientation (toward you or away from
      you).</p>
