      <p>As a standard action, you can activate a gaze attack with a 30-foot
      range (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 300). This is an active gaze attack that
      can target a single creature within range. The target must make a Will
      save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier). Those that
      fail take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 point for every two cleric
      levels you possess and are fascinated until the beginning of your next
      turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Wisdom modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
