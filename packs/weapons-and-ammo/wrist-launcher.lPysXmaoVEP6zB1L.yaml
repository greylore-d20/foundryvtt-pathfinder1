  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This slender tube is strapped to one forearm and designed to be
      concealed beneath the sleeve, where the wielder can fire a featherweight
      dart with a twist of the wrist. The launcher functions by means of a
      tightly compressed spring, and must be reloaded and re-cocked with a
      separate ramrod as a full-round action. After firing, the wearer can
      attempt a Sleight of Hand check opposed by opponents' Perception checks to
      keep the wrist launcher concealed. If you are proficient with hand
      crossbows, you are also proficient with wrist launchers.</p>
