      "value": "<p>At 20th level, you can overlay portions of your mindscape onto the world around you. This functions as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.82vi1xife3nlu8a0]{Mirage Arcana} spell, except all structures and terrain created must be places appearing within your mindscape. You can use this ability at will, but you can maintain only a single manifest memory at any one time. You can allow any creature you can see who has previously entered your mindscape to automatically disbelieve the illusion as a <em>free action</em>.</p>"
