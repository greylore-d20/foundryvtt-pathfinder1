      "value": "<p>The witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer hallucinatory distractions whenever it tries to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability for 1 round. Anytime the creature attempts to do so, it must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell level) or lose the spell. A successful Will saving throw negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p><p>Hexes that affect the misfortune hex, such as cackle, also affect distraction.</p>"
