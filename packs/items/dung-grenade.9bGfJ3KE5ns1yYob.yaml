      <p>The casing of this modified
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.50ofjPm8BcMLQblh]{fuse grenade} is
      partially filled with animal dung or guano. You can throw a dung grenade
      as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Any creature
      directly hit by a dung grenade or in its splash radius takes 1d6 points of
      fire damage and is covered with the grenadeâ€™s malodorous contents,
      becoming sickened for 1d4 rounds. A target can attempt a DC 15 Reflex
      saving throw to halve the damage and the duration of the sickened
      condition. Crafting a dung grenade requires a successful DC 25 Craft
      (alchemy) check.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p>Craft (Alchemy) DC 25</p>
