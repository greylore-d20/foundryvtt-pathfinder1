  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell protects the target's soul by briefly enveloping the target in
    an ethereal vault. The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against
    spells and effects that would trap or redirect its soul (such as <i>magic
    jar</i>, <i>soul bind</i>, and <i>trap the</i> soul) and effects that would
    transform the target into an undead creature. The target is granted a save
    to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. If it's cast on
    a living creature that then dies, the target's body and spirit are protected
    by the spell for its duration. If it's cast on a corpse within 1 round of
    death, the target's body and soul are both protected. Otherwise, only the
    body receives the protection.  Any spellcaster that worships Abadar may
    learn and cast <i>soul vault</i> as a 4th level spell, if it isn't normally
    on her class spell list. <i>Soul vault</i> can be made permanent with the
    <i>permanency</i> spell at a cost of 7,500 gp and a minimum caster level of
    11th.</p>
