  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This short, wide net is covered in barbed loops and slipknots. It works
      like a typical
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.weapons-and-ammo.Item.6oevs2mE3QqqQEAK]{net}, except
      it has the trip weapon special feature. If you entangle an opponent and
      hold the trailing rope, on your turn in place of a melee attack you may
      make a combat maneuver check to trip against that opponent; if you
      succeed, you may trip your opponent or deal 1 point of piercing damage to
      it. The concentration DC to cast while entangled in a snag net is 17 + the
      spell's level. The Escape Artist DC to escape a snag net is 22.</p>
