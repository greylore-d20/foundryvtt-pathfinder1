    value: >-
      <p>You gain the ability to see through solid rock as if it were
      transparent glass. You may see through 1 foot of stone per caster level.
      You see within the stone as if you were looking at the area in normal
      light, even if there is no illumination, though low-light vision and
      darkvision have no effect on your ability to see through stone. Metal at
      least 1 inch thick or wood or dirt at least 3 feet thick blocks your
      vision.</p><p>The spell does not negate concealment for those creatures
      hiding behind stone objects (the stone is still an obstacle to your
      attacks).</p>
