  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The focus of this spell flies upward above your head and takes a
      defensive position within your space. It lunges at opponents, as if guided
      by a martially trained hand, parrying and turning back melee attacks aimed
      at you, but does not strike back at any opponent nor does it damage them.
      The weapon serves only as a defense. While it protects you, you can cast
      spells without provoking attacks of opportunity, without the need to cast
      them defensively.  A creature with the Disruptive feat (<i>Core
      Rulebook</i> 122) can easily bypass this spell's defenses. You provoke
      attacks of opportunity for casting spells against these creatures even
      when subject to this spell, though you can still choose to cast
      defensively.</p>
