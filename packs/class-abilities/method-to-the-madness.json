If he selects bombs, he uses his Charisma bonus in place of his Intelligence bonus when determining the bonus to damage and the saving throw DCs of his bombs. If the alchemist selects extracts, he uses his Charisma bonus in place of his Intelligence bonus to calculate bonus extracts per day. The alchemist must have the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Derro\">madness extraordinary ability</a> to take this discovery. This discovery can be taken twice, allowing the alchemist to select both bombs and extracts.</p>"
