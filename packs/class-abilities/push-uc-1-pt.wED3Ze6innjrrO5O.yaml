      - Eidolon (Unchained)
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The eidolon gains the ability to push creatures away with a successful
      attack. Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a
      successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat
      maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, it pushes the
      target of the attack 5 feet directly away from it. This ability works only
      on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon.
      Creatures pushed in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not
      stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a
      different natural attack.</p>
