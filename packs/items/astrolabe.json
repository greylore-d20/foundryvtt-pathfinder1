      "value": "<p><b>Price</b> 1,000 gp; <b>Weight</b> 6 lbs.</p>\n<p>This device consists of a flat disc upon which two other discs are mounted. The mounted discs can rotate on a central axis, allowing them to spin and move as days pass. The bottom disc represents the latitude of the user; an <em>astrolabe</em> is useless if the user is outside the preset latitude. The upper disc represents the sky, and is filled with astronomical features. Anyone can be shown how to use an <em>astrolabe</em> at night to determine the date and time (which takes 1 minute). When using an <em>astrolabe</em>, you can make a Survival check using your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier to avoid becoming lost.</p>"
