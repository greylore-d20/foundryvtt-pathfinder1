      <p>You instill the target animal with the combat training general purpose
      (see the Handle Animal skill, <i>Core Rulebook</i> 98). This supersedes
      the animal's previous trained purpose and any tricks it knows. When the
      spell ends, it reverts to its previous trained purpose and known
