      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.4rcae3wehy2juylt]{sealed life}, except it
      additionally provides the benefits of <em>death ward</em> and renders its
      targets immune to effects that extract or transfer its soul, such as
      <em>possession</em> and <em>trap the soul</em>. This spell prevents a soul
      from returning to its body if it has already departed, until the spell's
      duration expires.</p>
