  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At first glance resembling a baton-like stick with a sling dangling
      from each end, this weapon requires extraordinary skill, or halfling
      acrobatics, to use to full effect. You can use a double sling as a normal
      sling, or use the second end to make one additional ranged attack each
      round. You take the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons when
      you use both ends of a double sling (as if it were a double weapon); the
      Two- Weapon Fighting feat reduces these penalties as normal. Reloading one
      end of a double sling is a move action ( just like a normal sling), so
      unless you have an ability or feat (such as Ammo Drop) that allows you to
      quickly reload a sling, you cannot normally make multiple attacks per
      round for several consecutive rounds with this weapon.</p><p>You can hurl
      ordinary stones with a double sling, but stones are not as dense or as
      round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were
      designed for a creature one size category smaller than you, and you take a
      -1 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
