      "value": "<p>The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it’s affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell’s level or lower. If the linked spell doesn’t already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell’s level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save).</p>\n<p>This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.</p>"
