      <p>This weapon consists of a small metal tube hidden within a sleeve; the
      tube holds a short, spring-loaded bamboo shaft. You gain a +2 bonus on
      Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a tube arrow shooter on your body.
      Releasing the fastener allows the spring to force the arrow out. Once a
      shaft is fired, the tube must be reloaded before it can be used again.
      Reloading a tube is a full-round action, or a standard action if the
      wielder has the Rapid Reload feat.</p>
