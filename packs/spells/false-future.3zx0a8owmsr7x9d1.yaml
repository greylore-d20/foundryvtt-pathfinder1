      <p>You interfere with attempts to predict the target's future by
      preventing divinations from revealing what the target will do and what
      will befall the target while under the spell's effects. Instead of the
      target's true actions or experiences, divinations resolve as if the target
      will experience some different future you describe as you cast <i>false
      future</i>. The target creature can attempt a Will save to avoid the
      initial effect, and creatures using divinations get a Will save to
      disbelieve the illusion. This spell doesn't prevent divinations cast after
      the duration's end from determining what the subject actually did during
      the time you obscured using <i>false future</i>. <i>False future</i> can't
      be detected by <i>detect magic</i> or <i>identify</i>, but greater
      <i>detect magic</i> (see page 212) can detect it.</p>
