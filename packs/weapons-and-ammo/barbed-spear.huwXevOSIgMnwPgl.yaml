      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A barbed spear is a 10-foot-long polearm with
      a fourpronged head similar to a caltrop. The head is connected to the pole
      by a single weak bolt, giving the weapon the fragile condition. When you
      use a barbed spear to attack a creature that is prone, flying above you,
      or at least one size category larger than you, you can make a melee attack
      with a -4 penalty to jam the barbed head into the target's foot. If you're
      successful, the target takes 1 point of damage and the barbed head breaks
      off in the target's foot. The barb then acts as a caltrop, wounding the
      creature's foot and halving its speed. This movement penalty lasts for 24
      hours, or until the creature is treated with a successful DC 15 Heal check
      or receives at least 1 point of magical healing. Like caltrops, barbed
      spears may not work against unusual opponents. A barbed spear that embeds
      its caltrop-like head into a target's foot gains the broken condition, and
      can't be used as a weapon until it's repaired.</p>
