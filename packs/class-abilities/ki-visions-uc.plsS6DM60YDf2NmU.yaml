  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monk with this ability often sees visions of spirits or hears the
      voice of his departed mentor in his dreams. On any given night during
      which the monk dreams, he can use this ability to gain the benefits of a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.pwueht12qqo0268e]{Divination}. If he does, he
      spends 2 ki points from the next dayâ€™s total.</p>

      <p>A monk must be at least 10th level before selecting this ki power.</p>
