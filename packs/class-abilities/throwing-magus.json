      "value": "<p>Whenever the magus enhances his weapon using his arcane pool, he can spend 1 additional point from his arcane pool to add the&nbsp;returning&nbsp;and&nbsp;throwing&nbsp;abilities to the list of available weapon special abilities. When the magus throws a weapon enhanced by his arcane pool and hits a foe, he regains 1 arcane pool point. The magus can regain a number of arcane pool points per day equal to his Intelligence modifier in this way. If he throws his held weapon and draws another in the same round, he can enhance the newly drawn weapon with his arcane pool as a free action instead of a swift action.</p>"
