  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At will, an antipaladin can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mkgysr5o92kxxn59]{Detect Good}, as the spell. An
      antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or
      individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the
      strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing
      on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any
      other object or individual within range.</p>
