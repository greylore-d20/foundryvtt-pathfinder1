      <p>This spell functions like <i>lesser restoration,</i> except that it
      dispels all permanent and temporary negative levels afflicting the healed
      creature. <i>Greater restoration</i> also dispels all magical effects
      penalizing the creature's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage,
      and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It
      also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity,
      confusion, and similar mental effects.</p>
