      <p><em>A shaman who selects the life spirit appears more vibrant than most
      mortals. Her skin seems to glow, and her teeth are a pearly white. When
      she calls upon one of this spirit’s abilities, her eyes and hair shimmer
      in the light.</em><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells:</b> </p>

      <p><b>Spirit Animal:</b> The shaman’s spirit animal appears to be a
      beautiful and very healthy version of its species, and seems especially
      vibrant and full of life. Her animal companion gains fast healing 1
      (Bestiary 300); if the spirit animal already has fast healing, instead its
      fast healing increases by 1.</p>
