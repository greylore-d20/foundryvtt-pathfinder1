This blessing lasts until the blessed creature hits with an attack or deals damage to a target. The shaman can have only one ancestral blessing active at a time. If the shaman uses this ability again, the previous blessing immediately ends.</p>\n<p>At 8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this blessing increase by 1.</p>"
