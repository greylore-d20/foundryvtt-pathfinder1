    value: >-
      <p>Creatures in the area of this spell are subject to a subtle enchantment
      that confounds their senses of direction, interferes with recognizing
      landmarks, and causes them to misjudge distances and angles. Creatures
      that enter the area must succeed at a new Survival check to avoid becoming
      lost immediately, whether or not they succeed at their saving throws.
      Those that fail the save take a penalty on such Survival checks equal to
      double your caster level, treat all squares they enter as difficult
      terrain for as long as they are in the area and for 1 hour per caster
      level thereafter, lose the benefit of all effects that allow them to
      ignore difficult terrain, and take a -4 penalty to Dexterity. <i>Lost
      passage</i> can be made permanent with <i>permanency</i> at a cost of
      10,000 gp.</p>
