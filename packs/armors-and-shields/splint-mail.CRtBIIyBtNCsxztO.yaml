  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Splint mail is made up of overlapping layers of metal strips attached
      to a backing of leather or sturdy fabric. These splints are of greater
      size and durability than those that compose a suit of scale mail,
      improving the protection they afford the wearer, but at the cost of
      flexibility. A suit of splint mail includes gauntlets.</p>
