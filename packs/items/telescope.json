Telescopes can be built to a variety of specifications, but those most often used by adventuring stargazers are listed here. A telescope grants the listed <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a> (+2, +4, or +6) on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a> checks (see table above) to discern celestial bodies and on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (geography) checks to learn about the planets when used at night.</p>\r\n<p>A telescope can be used to look at either terrestrial or celestial objects. Distance penalties on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a> checks for viewing objects through the telescope are divided by the telescope's magnification. Assembling, disassembling, or significantly moving a telescope takes 1 minute.</p>\r\n\r\n"
