  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts an
      Intelligence or Knowledge check to remember a previous experience. The
      subject receives flashes of her entire life up to this point. She can use
      the mesmeristâ€™s Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier on
      the check, and she can attempt the check untrained. The subject cannot
      learn information that she has not previously read, heard, or otherwise
      experienced at some point during her life when using this ability.</p>
