      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except that every creature within 60 feet of a <em>Symbol of Weakness</em>
      instead suffers crippling weakness that deals [[/r 3d6]] points of
      Strength damage.</p><p>Unlike <em>symbol of death</em>, <em>Symbol of
      Weakness</em> has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <em>Symbol of
      Weakness</em> simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A
      creature can only be affected by this symbol once.</p><p><em>Note</em>:
      Magic traps such as <em>Symbol of Weakness</em> are hard to detect and
      disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a
      character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to
      disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for <em>Symbol
      of Weakness</em>.</p>
