      <p>You fill creatures with feelings of seething envy. Affected targets
      turn upon the nearest creature (whether an ally or enemy) and attempt to
      disarm it of a valuable weapon, steal something it is holding, or grapple
      it and strip it of something it prizes (your choice). Affected targets can
      attempt a new Will save each round as a free action to end this
      effect.</p>
