  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman places a protective ward over one creature. The warded
      creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on
      saving throws. This effect lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails
      a saving throw. A shaman knows when a warded creature is no longer
      protected. A shaman can have only one ward active at a time. If the shaman
      uses this hex while a previous ward is still active, that previous ward
      immediately ends. A shaman cannot use this ability on herself.</p>

      <p>At 8th and 16th levels, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by
      1.</p>
