      "value": "<p>You cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike a foe before instantly returning to you. As a standard action, you can make a single attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier on the attack roll instead of your <em>Dexterity</em> modifier (damage still relies on <em>Strength</em>). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>"
