When the ninja intercepts an attack using this feat, she can spend 1 ki point to impose a blood debt on the aided ally. The ninja’s ki pool is reduced by 1 until she ends this effect, which she may do as an immediate action. If the ninja ends the blood debt in response to a successful attack against her by a creature the indebted ally threatens, the ally (who must be willing) takes full damage from that attack and any associated effects instead of the ninja.</p>"
