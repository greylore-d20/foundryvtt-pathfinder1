  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can create an invisible shell of air that grants you a +4 armor
      bonus.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by
      +2.</p>

      <p>At 13th level, this barrier causes incoming arrows, rays, and other
      ranged attacks requiring an attack roll against you to have a 50% miss
      chance.</p>

      <p>You can use this barrier for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This
      duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour
      increments.</p>
