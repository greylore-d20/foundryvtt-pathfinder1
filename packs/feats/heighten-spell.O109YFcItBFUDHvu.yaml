      <i>You can cast spells as if they were a higher level.</i>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a
      maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell
      actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All
      effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to
      penetrate a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>) are calculated
      according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to
      prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.</p>
