      <p>Your skin hardens like stone, dampening the impact of most attacks. You
      gain DR 1/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for every 2 kineticist levels
      you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the
      DR by 1 until the next time your burn is removed, to a maximum DR equal to
      your kineticist level.</p>

      <p>Whenever you accept burn while using an earth wild talent, the energy
      surging through you causes your damage reduction to change from
      DR/adamantine to DR/— for 1 round. You can dismiss and restore this effect
      as an immediate action.</p>
