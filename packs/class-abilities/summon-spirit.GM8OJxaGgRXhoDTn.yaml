  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch calls forth the ghost of a humanoid creature with no more
      than 18 Hit Dice. The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is
      willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.0wamdkl9gp19l55w]{Planar Ally, Greater}. To seal an
      agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1
      temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for
      the ghost's service).</p>

      <p>This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in the
      service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as a standard
      action, immediately removing the negative level.</p>
