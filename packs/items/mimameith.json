Gather DC 25; <b>Yield</b> 1d4 doses (5 lbs. per dose)</p>\r\n<p><b>Terrain</b> any forests or mountains</p>\r\n<p><b>Preparation</b> A living mimameith tree has <em>hardness</em> 7 (rather than the typical <em>hardness</em> 5 for most wooden objects) and <em>fire resistance</em> 5. When a mimameith tree is burned but lives, its bark regrows over time with pale gray scarring-such bark <em>bears</em> special properties. Once harvested, this bark can be processed alchemically. Doing so requires a 5-pound dose of the bark to be soaked in water for 8 hours and then boiled off to a thin layer of tacky paste with a successful DC 20 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check.</p>\r\n<p><b>Use</b> When a dose of the pasty residue from mimameith bark is applied to a creature's skin as a <em>standard action</em>, the subject gains <em>damage reduction</em> 2/bludgeoning, <em>fire resistance</em> 5, and <em>immunity</em> to <em>bleed</em> effects for 1 hour.</p>\r\n"
