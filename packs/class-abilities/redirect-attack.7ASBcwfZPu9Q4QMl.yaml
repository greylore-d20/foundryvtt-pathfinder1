      <p>Once per day, when a character with this talent is hit with a melee attack,
      she can redirect the attack to strike at an adjacent creature with a free
      action. The creature targeted must be within melee reach of the attack
      that hit the rogue, and the creature that made the attack against the
      rogue must make a new attack roll against the new target.</p>
