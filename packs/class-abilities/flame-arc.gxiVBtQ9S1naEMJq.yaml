  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can unleash an arc of flame by expending 1 point from her
      arcane reservoir. This creates a 30-foot line of flame that deals 1d6
      points of fire damage + the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier, plus an
      additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a
      maximum of 10d6 at 19th level) to each target in the line. Creatures in
      the area of effect may attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the
      damage.</p>
