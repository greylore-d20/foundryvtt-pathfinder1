  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This ornately etched censer has a small hidden compartment under the
      heat source that can hold 1 dose of <em>poison</em>. When in use, the
      censer's <em>heat</em> source indirectly heats the <em>poison</em>,
      causing it to mix with the burning incense and allow the <em>poison</em>
      to permeate the air, filling a 20-foot radius centered on the censer. The
      poison's type changes to inhaled, and it is effective for 5 minutes before
      it is entirely burned off.</p>
