It consists of a complex <em>banner</em> (depicting a family crest or symbol of the presiding noble), four bedrolls (for servants), four blankets (for servants), two cots (for nobles), two winter blankets (for nobles), 10 cups of <em>coffee</em>, a <em>royal outfit</em>, two large tents, and a pavilion <em>tent</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone with a modicum of wilderness experience should recognize that the kit's contents are of little use on a prolonged journey. Oftentimes, the actual necessities of wilderness survival are left to the servants to handle.</p>\r\n\r\n"
