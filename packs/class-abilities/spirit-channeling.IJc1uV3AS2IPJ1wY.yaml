  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As your self-awareness expands, you become increasingly attuned to the
      spirit world around you. At 5th level, as part of your meditation to
      initiate metamorphosis, you can invite a wandering spirit to share your
      body as if you were a shaman (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 37). You
      gain the associated 1st-level spirit ability as long as you maintain your
      altered form, but your metamorphosis form also exhibits some aspect of the
      spirit you host, such as vivid red hair for a flame spirit or gauntness
      for a bone spirit.</p>
