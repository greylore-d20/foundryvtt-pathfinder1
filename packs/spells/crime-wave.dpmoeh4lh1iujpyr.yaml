      <p>You instill overwhelming avarice in the targets and impel them toward a
      wild spree of larceny. Creatures affected by a crime wave must roll
      percentile dice each round to determine what action they
      take.</p><table><thead><tr><th
      style="width:5em"><p>d%</p></th><th><p>Behaviour</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1
      – 25</p></td><td><p>Act normally, but with suspicion toward others. The
      target doesn’t benefit from or provide benefits with teamwork feats and
      the aid another action. If a creature attempts to use a harmless spell or
      effect on the target, there is a 50% chance the target tries to avoid that
      effect as best as possible (taking an attack of opportunity against a
      spellcaster, requiring a successful attack roll on a touch spell, or
      attempting a saving throw).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>26 –
      50</p></td><td><p>Attempt a steal combat maneuver or Sleight of Hand check
      to steal a random valuable object from the nearest creature (or a nearby
      unattended object, if obviously of great value), moving adjacent to that
      creature or object as needed. Once an affected creature has stolen an
      item, further results of 26–50 cause the affected creature to flee,
      focusing all of its efforts on escaping with its loot and fighting to
      prevent the stolen object from being taken.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>51 –
      75</p></td><td><p>Attempt to break, destroy, or deface the nearest
      unattended manufactured object or structure. If the object or structure is
      too difficult to damage, the affected creature instead vandalizes or
      otherwise defaces its appearance.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>76 –

      familiar counts as part of the affected creature’s

      wave who is unable to carry out the indicated action moves toward the
      nearest source of cover or concealment and attempts a Stealth check to
      hide. Affected creatures with the ability to turn invisible (including
      through the use of magic items or spells) do so instead of attempting a
      Stealth check.</p>
