      <p>You become a Medium esoteric or outer dragon. Psychics can choose from
      the esoteric dragon (astral, dream, etheric, nightmare, or occult) forms
      only. You gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a +2 size bonus to your
      Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 60 feet (poor),
      darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a breath weapon, and resistance to one
      form of energy or effect. You also gain one bite attack (1d8), two claw
      attacks (1d6), and two wing attacks (1d4). Your breath weapon and
      resistance depend on the type of dragon. You can use the breath weapon
      only once per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of
      damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal
      damage. In addition, some of the dragon types grant additional abilities,
