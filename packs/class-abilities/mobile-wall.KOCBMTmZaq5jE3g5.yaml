  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, the cavalier receives
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.Mz8ZG6nqW3NKFZhK]{Step Up} as a bonus feat. He can
      use this feat while mounted by succeeding at a DC 15 Ride check, directing
      his mount to move rather than himself. The cavalier gains a +1 bonus to
      his CMD against attempts to tumble through squares he threatens. At 6th
      level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by an
      additional +1.</p>
