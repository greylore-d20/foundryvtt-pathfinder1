  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you cast a spell that deals hit point damage, you deal extra
      damage to creatures made of metal or wearing medium or heavy metal armor.
      Affected creatures take additional damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level.
      This bonus damage is not increased by Empower Spell or similar effects.
      This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and
      cannot be split between multiple missiles or rays. The damage is of the
      same type as the spell.</p><p>At 20th level, whenever you cast a spell on
      a creature made of metal or wearing medium or heavy armor, you can roll
      twice to penetrate the creature's spell resistance and take the better
      result.</p>
