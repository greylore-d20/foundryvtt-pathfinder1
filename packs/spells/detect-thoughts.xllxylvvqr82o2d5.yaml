      <p>You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends
      on how long you study a particular area or subject.</p><p><i>1st
      Round</i>: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with
      Intelligence scores of 1 or higher).</p><p><i>2nd Round</i>: Number of
      thinking minds and the Intelligence score of each. If the highest
      Intelligence is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own
      Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This
      spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you
      can't see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.</p><p><i>3rd
      Round</i>: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's Will save
      prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast <i>detect
      thoughts</i> again to have another chance. Creatures of animal
      intelligence (Int 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts.</p><p>Each
      round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can
      penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin
      sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>
