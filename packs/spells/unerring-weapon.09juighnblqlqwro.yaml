      <p>This spell causes a weapon to veer closer to vital areas, improving the
      result of a critical threat. This transmutation grants a +2 bonus on
      attack rolls to confirm critical hits plus 1 additional bonus point per
      four caster levels (maximum total bonus +7). If the spell is cast on
      projectiles, the effect ends on a specific projectile whenever that
      projectile is used to make an attack, regardless of whether the attack
      hits. For this spell, shuriken are considered projectiles.</p>
