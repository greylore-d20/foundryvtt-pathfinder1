      <p>You infuse the target with the blood used as a material component,
      imparting malicious power. As long as the hat is worn (occupying the
      wearerâ€™s head slot as though it were a magic item), it grants its wearer a
      +2 bonus on damage rolls and causes the wearer to regain 1d4 hit points
      whenever they deal the killing blow to a living creature.</p>
