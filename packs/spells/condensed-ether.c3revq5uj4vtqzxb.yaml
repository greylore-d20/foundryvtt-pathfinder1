  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You condense the substance of the Ethereal Plane as it interpenetrates
      the Material Plane. This thickened planar conjunction slows movement
      through the area to a crawl. Creatures moving through <i>condensed
      ether</i> (even incorporeal creatures), move at only half their normal
      speed and can't take 5-foot steps. This slowing of movement doesn't stack
      with <i>solid fog</i> or similar effects. Creatures within <i>condensed
      ether</i> take a -2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, and
      <i>condensed ether</i> prevents effective ranged weapon attacks. Even
      magic rays and similar ranged attacks suffer a 20% miss chance on attacks
      into or passing through <i>condensed ether</i>. This miss chance is not
      based on concealment, and Blind-Fight, <i>true seeing</i>, and similar
      effects do not reduce it.</p>
