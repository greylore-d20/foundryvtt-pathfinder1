  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When another character within 30 feet casts a spell with a range
      greater than touch, you can attempt a caster level check as an immediate
      action (DC = 15 + the spell’s level). If you succeed at the check, you
      receive the spell’s benefit instead of one of the spell’s intended targets
      (chosen by you). If you are already a target of the spell, you are
      affected as though you were targeted by the same spell twice (which may or
      may not benefit you; remember that bonuses from the same source do not
      stack). This ability does not grant you knowledge of the spell being cast.
      You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Copycat power of the Trickery Domain.</p>
