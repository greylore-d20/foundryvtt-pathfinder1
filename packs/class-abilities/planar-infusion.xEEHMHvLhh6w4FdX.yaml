  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action once per day, you can cause a 20-foot-spread to
      gain either the mildly chaotic-aligned or mildly evil-aligned planar trait
      for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. Lawful creatures in a
      chaotic-aligned area take a –2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based
      checks, as do good creatures in an evil-aligned area.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, the infusion makes the area strongly aligned, which
      causes the –2 circumstance penalty to apply on all Intelligence-, Wisdom-,
      and Charisma-based checks made by any creature that lacks the matching
      alignment component (these penalties stack with those from the lower-level
      effect).</p>

      <p>You must be chaotic or evil to select this revelation, and you can only
      infuse an area with an alignment that matches a component of your own
      alignment.</p>
