      1</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A cybernetic ear can be enhanced by cyberart
      at no additional cost, giving it an unusual color or shape. When a pair of
      ears is installed, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception
      checks. This bonus stacks with circumstance bonuses on Perception checks
      from other cybernetic senses. Cybernetic ears grant a +4 resistance bonus
      on all saving throws against sonic effects.</p><p>The listed price,
      implantation value, and install DC are for having both ears installed. A
      single cybernetic ear costs half the price and half the listed
      implantation value, but a creature must replace all of its ears to receive
      the benefits above.</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: Remove changes if only
      one ear is installed</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC
