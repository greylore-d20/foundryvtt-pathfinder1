      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><b>Damage</b> 1d6 (small), 1d8 (medium);

      Groups</b> Thrown</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Made from a specially designed
      sling attached to a short club, a halfling sling staff can be used by a
      proficient wielder to devastating effect. Your Strength modifier applies
      to damage rolls when you use a halfling sling staff, just as it does for
      thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a halfling sling staff with
      one hand. Loading a halfling sling staff is a move action that requires
      two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.</p><p>A halfling sling
      staff fires bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a halfling sling
      staff, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an
      attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size
      category smaller than you and you take a -1 penalty on attack
      rolls.</p><p>A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple weapon that
      deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size. Halflings
      treat halfling sling staves as martial weapons.</p>
