  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This ability allows a rogue to move along narrow, uneven, or slippery
      surfaces (such as ice) at full speed using the Acrobatics skill without
      penalty. In addition, a rogue with this talent is not flat-footed when
      using Acrobatics to move along such surfaces, and retains her Dexterity
      bonus to AC.</p>
