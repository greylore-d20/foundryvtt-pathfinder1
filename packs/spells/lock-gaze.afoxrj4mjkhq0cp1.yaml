  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You compel the target to look at you and only you for the spell's
    duration or until the spell is discharged. While staring at you, the target
    is considered to be averting its eyes from every creature but you, granting
    creatures other than you concealment against the target's attacks. If the
    target willingly leaves your line of sight, it is blinded for 1 round and
    the spell ends. If you willingly leave the target's line of sight or become
    unconscious or dead, the spell creature suffers no ill effects. Blind
    creatures and creatures immune to gaze attacks are immune to this spell.</p>
