Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a <em>standard action</em> (rather than a <em>full-round action</em>), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a <em>standard action</em>.</p>"
