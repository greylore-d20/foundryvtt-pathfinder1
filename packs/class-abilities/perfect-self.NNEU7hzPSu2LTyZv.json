      "value": "<p>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an <em>outsider</em> rather than as a <em>humanoid</em> (or whatever the monk’s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains <em>damage reduction</em> 10/<em>chaotic</em>, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any <em>natural attack</em> made by a creature that doesn’t have similar <em>damage reduction</em>. Unlike other <em>outsiders</em>, the monk can still be brought back from the <em>dead</em> as if he were a member of his previous creature type.</p>"
