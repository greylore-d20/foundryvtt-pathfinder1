    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line of magical energy, gaining a
      breath weapon. Select either acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The eidolon
      can breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of
      damage of the selected type per HD it possesses. Those caught in the
      breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal
      to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Constitution modifier.</p>

      <p>The eidolon can use this ability once per day. The eidolon can use this
      ability 1 additional time per day by spending an additional 1 evolution
      point (maximum 3/day).</p>

      <p>The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this
      evolution.</p>
