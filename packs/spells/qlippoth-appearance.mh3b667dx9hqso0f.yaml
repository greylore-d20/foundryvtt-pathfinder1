      <p>When under the effects of this spell, your face and body appear subtly
      wrong, though you are still recognizable as yourself. You gain a +4
      circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks but take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy
      checks. As long as this spell's effects persist, you can reveal the face
      under your face as a standard action, assaulting the senses of a single
      living creature within 30 feet that can see you. A targeted creature must
      succeed at a Will save against the DC of this spell or be subject to one
      of the following effects (your choice). Every time you use this ability,
      you reduce the remaining duration of this spell by 10 minutes.
      </p><ul><li> The affected creature takes 1 point of Wisdom damage.
      </li><li> The affected creature is paralyzed with revulsion for 1 round.
