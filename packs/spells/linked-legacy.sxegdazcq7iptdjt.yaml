    <p>This spell helps build community and ensure a shared vision for the
    future. When any of the affected creatures succeeds at a Knowledge check to
    answer a question within its field of study or identify a monster and its
    special powers or vulnerabilities, as a free action the affected creature
    can share any information gained automatically with all targets of the
    spell. If any of the targets move out of the spell's range, the spell ceases
    to function for all of them until they are all within close range of you
    again.</p>
