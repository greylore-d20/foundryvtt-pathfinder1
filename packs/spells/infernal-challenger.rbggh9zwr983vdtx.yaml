    value: >-
      <p>This spell summons a bearded devil, causing it to appear where you
      designate. The area within a 50-foot radius of where the devil appears is
      ringed with a smoldering, red glow. This area is the testing ground. To
      successfully cast this spell, no creature other than the devil's
      challenger (see below) can be within this area while the spell is being
      cast. On the round it appears, the devil identifies itself (typically by
      name and with a brief recitation of honors) and states it is prepared to
      do battle with a sole mortal champion. In the same round, either you or a
      creature you designate while casting the spell must identify the devil's
      challenger. For the duration of the spell, the devil does everything in
      its power to kill the challenger. You do not control the devil or have any
      influence over how it conducts itself in battle, but the devil cannot
      leave the testing ground. Unlike with <i>summon monster</i> and similar
      spells, you cannot dismiss the devil. Rather, the conjured devil remains
      until any one of the following criteria is met: it is reduced below 0 hit
      points or otherwise defeated, its challenger is slain, its challenger
      leaves the testing ground, or it takes damage from any source other than
      its challenger. Upon any of these occurrences, the devil vanishes.
      Conjuring a devil is typically an evil act. If cast for any purpose
      besides the administering of a Hellknight test, this spell has the evil
      descriptor.</p>
