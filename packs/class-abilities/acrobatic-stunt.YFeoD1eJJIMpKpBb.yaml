    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, when flanked by at least two opponents, a rogue with this
      talent can, as an immediate action when any of the threatening opponents
      attacks her, attempt an Acrobatics check against the highest CMD of the
      threatening creatures plus 2 per threatening creature beyond the second.
      If successful, the rogue may take a 5-foot step in any direction, so long
      as she remains within the reach of the attacker triggering the movement.
      The rogueâ€™s final position is used to determine whether the attacker
      benefits from flanking. On a failed check, the rogue falls prone in her
      original position and the attack resolves as normal (the opponent gains a
      +4 bonus for attacking a prone target). A rogue may use this ability one
      additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses. A rogue
      must be trained in Acrobatics to select this talent.</p>
