  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you ignore <em>concealment</em> and <em>Perception</em>
      penalties in natural or magical snow, ice, fog, and similar weather
      conditions. In addition, you can surround yourself with a cloak of
      swirling snow for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level.
      This power acts and deals damage as a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.nfm6i9z9r3n2fku7]{Fire Shield} (chill shield) that
      sheds no light. It provides a 20% miss chance on attacks made against you
      and grants a bonus on <em>Stealth</em> checks equal to 1/2 your sorcerer
      level in snowy or icy areas. You can use this ability once per day at 9th
      level, twice per day at 17th, and three times per day at 20th.</p>
