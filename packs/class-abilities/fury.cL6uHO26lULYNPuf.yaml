  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A shaman incites a creature within 30 feet into a primal fury. The
      target receives a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +2 resistance
      bonus on saving throws against fear for a number of rounds equal to the
      shamanâ€™s Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>At 8th and 16th levels, these bonuses increase by 1.</p>

      <p>Once a creature has benefited from the fury hex, it cannot benefit from
      it again for 24 hours.</p>
