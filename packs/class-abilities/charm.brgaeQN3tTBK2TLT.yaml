    value: >-
      <p>A witch can charm an animal or humanoid creature within 30 feet by
      beckoning and speaking soothing words. This improves the attitude of an
      animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the witch had successfully
      used the Diplomacy skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to
      the Witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates this effect.
      Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of
      this hex again for 1 day.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, this effect improves the attitude of the target creature
      by 2 steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p>
