    <p>This spell functions as per <i>Form of the Exotic Dragon I</i>, except it
    also allows you to assume the form of a Large imperial or primal dragon.

    bonus, a fly speed of 90 feet (poor), darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a

    (1d8), a tail slap attack (1d8), and either a gore attack (2d6) if you

    damage unless noted and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal damage. Line
    breath weapons increase to 80-foot lines and cones increase to 40-foot
    cones.</p>
