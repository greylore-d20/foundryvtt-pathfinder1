      <i>You can create magic rings.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Caster level 7th.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>You can create magic rings. Crafting a ring takes 1 day for each 1,000
      gp in its base price. To craft a ring, you must use up raw materials
      costing half of the base price. See the magic item creation rules in Magic
      Items for more information.</p><p>You can also mend a broken ring if it is
      one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half
      the time it would take to forge that ring in the first place.</p>
