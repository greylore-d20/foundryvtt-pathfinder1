  shortDescription: >-
    <p>All attacks made by the target match your alignment, counting as either
    chaotic, evil, good, or lawful as appropriate. If your alignment includes
    multiple alignment components, such as lawful good, you select one alignment
    component to impart to the target. Whenever the target confirms a critical
    hit against or takes damage from a creature, that creature must attempt a
    Will save. On a failed save, the creature is sent to the Outer Plane
    matching your alignment, as per
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.q3st18udsalnyz5v]{plane shift}, and the spell ends. A
    warpriest treats this spell as a 6th-level cleric spell for the purposes of
    preparing the spell, determining DCs, and so forth.</p>
