      "value": "<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2><ul><li><b>Ability Score Modifiers:</b> Deep one hybrids are hearty and devout, but tend to be somewhat slow and awkward in their movements. They gain +2 <em>Constitution</em> and +2 <em>Wisdom</em> but suffer –2 <em>Dexterity</em>.</li><li><b>Type:</b> Deep One Hybrids are <em>Humanoids</em> with the <em>Human</em> and <em>Deep One</em> subtypes.</li><li><b>Size:</b> Deep One Hybrids are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li><li><b>Speed:</b> A deep one hybrid's base speed is 20 feet, as it walks with a shuffling gait. A deep one hybrid has a swim speed of 30 feet, and gains a +8 <em>racial bonus</em> on all <em>Swim</em> checks.</li><li><b>Languages:</b> Deep one hybrids begin play speaking Aklo and Common. Hybrids with high <em>Intelligence</em> scores can choose from the following languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Halfling, Orc, and Undercommon.</li></ul><h3>Senses</h3><ul><li><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> A deep one hybrid can see twice as far as a <em>human</em> in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of dim light.</li></ul><h3>Defensive Abilities</h3><ul><li><b>Natural Armor:</b> A deep one hybrid's thick skin and dense fatty tissues grant it a +1 <em>natural armor bonus</em> to AC.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous Abilities</h3><ul><li><b>Final Change (Su):</b> A deep one hybrid ages at the same rate as a <em>half-orc</em>. A mere 1d12 months after a deep one hybrid reaches venerable age (at 60 years old), it dies a painful, agonizing death, only to have its body transform into that of a mature <em>deep one</em>. This transformation functions as the <em>reincarnate</em> spell, with the newly formed <em>deep one</em> gaining the following modifications to its physical ability scores: +6 <em>Strength</em>, –2 <em>Dexterity</em>, and +6 <em>Constitution</em>.</li><li><b>Sea Longing (Ex):</b> Every 24 hours a deep one hybrid spends in an area more than 10 miles from the sea, it must succeed at a DC 20 <em>Will save</em> or take 1 point of <em>Wisdom drain</em>.</li><li><b>Take to the Water (Ex):</b> A deep one hybrid can hold its breath 10 times longer than a <em>human</em> can, and gains a +2 bonus on <em>Initiative</em> checks and <em>Reflex</em>saving throws while swimming.</li></ul>"
