  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While protected by <em>fastidiousness</em>, your person and your
      equipment stay clean and dry. Dust and moisture slough off immediately;
      even when you are completely soiled, your appearance reverts to a pristine
      state over the course of 1 minute. While this spell offers no protection
      against most attacks, staying constantly sanitary grants you a +2
      circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against inhaled and ingested
      diseases.</p>

      <p>Members of the Prophet of Kalistrade prestige class can cast this
      spell, even though it is not a divination or enchantment.</p>
