      <p>A character with this talent can select a single terrain from the
      ranger’s favored terrain list. She is a master at hiding in that terrain,
      and while within that terrain, she can use the Stealth skill to hide, even
      while being observed. A character may take this advanced talent more than
      once, each time selecting a different terrain from the favored terrain
      list.</p>
