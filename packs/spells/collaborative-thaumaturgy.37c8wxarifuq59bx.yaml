  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You tap into the magical resonance between you and your allies to enhance
    one another's magic. Cast this spell when an ally casts a spell at least 1
    level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast.</p><p>The ally casts
    her spell as if one of the following metamagic feats were applied to it
    without increasing the spell level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend
    Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. If the ally is the target of two
    <i>collaborative thaumaturgy</i> spells when casting a spell, the ally can
    instead apply the Empower Spell metamagic feat to a spell at least 2 levels
    lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. Finally, if the ally is the
    target of three <i>collaborative thaumaturgy</i> spells when casting a
    spell, she can instead apply the Maximize Spell or Widen Spell metamagic
    feat to a spell at least 3 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can
    cast. You can't target yourself with <i>collaborative thaumaturgy</i>.</p>
