      <p><b>Requirements:</b> Summoner level 5th.</p>

      <p>The eidolon grows large wings, like those of a bat, bird, insect, or
      dragon, gaining the ability to fly. The eidolon gains a fly speed equal to
      its base speed. The eidolonâ€™s maneuverability depends on its size. Medium
      or smaller eidolons have good maneuverability. Large eidolons have average
      maneuverability, while Huge eidolons have poor maneuverability.</p>

      <p>For 2 additional evolution points, the eidolon flies by means of magic.
      It loses its wings, but its maneuverability increases to perfect. If the
      eidolon flies by magic, this is a supernatural ability.</p>

      <p>The eidolon can increase its fly speed by spending additional evolution
      points, gaining a 20-foot increase to its fly speed for each additional
      point spent.</p>
