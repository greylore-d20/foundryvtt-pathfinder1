      <p>Wood <i>shape</i> enables you to form one existing piece of wood into
      any <i>shape</i> that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make
      crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn't possible. There is a
      30% chance that any <i>shape</i> that includes moving parts simply doesn't
      work.</p>
