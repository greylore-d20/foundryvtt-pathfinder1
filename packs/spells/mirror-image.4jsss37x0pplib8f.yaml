  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit
      your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely
      locate and attack you.</p><p>When <i>mirror image</i> is cast, 1d4 images
      plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are
      created.</p><p>These images remain in your space and move with you,
      mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are
      attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there
      is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If
      the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is
      real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the
      attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near
      miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your
      figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you
      normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a
      touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a
      figment.</p><p>An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled.
      If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect
      (although the normal miss chances still apply).</p>
