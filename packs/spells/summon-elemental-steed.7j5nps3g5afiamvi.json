Passengers are not otherwise protected, though the elemental chariot does provide cover like a normal chariot.</p><p>The elemental keeps all of its statistics and abilities, except it loses its slam attacks and gains a trample attack (<i>Pathfinder</i> <i>RPG Bestiary</i> 305).</p><p>When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p><p>This spell is almost exclusively used by the Green Faith.</p>"
