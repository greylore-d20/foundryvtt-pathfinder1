    value: >-
      <p>Your teeth extend and sharpen, transforming your mouth into a maw of
      razor-sharp fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage
      plus your Strength modifier. If you confirm a critical hit with this
      attack, it also deals 1 point of bleed damage. If you already have a bite
      attack, your bite deals 2 points of bleed damage on a critical hit. You
      are considered proficient with this attack. If used as part of a
      full-attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack, is made at
      your full base attack bonus -5, and adds half your Strength modifier to
      its damage.  You can end this spell before its normal duration by making a
      bestial roar as a swift action. When you do, you can make an Intimidate
      check to demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the
      roar.</p>
