  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, you can unleash a more primal version of yourself as a
      free action. This functions as transformation, with the following
      exceptions. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal
      to your psychic level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You can
      end the effect as a free action.</p>

      <p>After using this ability, you are fatigued for a number of rounds equal
      to twice the number of rounds spent in primal fury.</p>

      <p>You cannot enter a new primal fury while fatigued or exhausted. If you
      fall unconscious, your primal fury immediately ends.</p>
