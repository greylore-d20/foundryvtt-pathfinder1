If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal.</p>\n<p>At 8th and 16th levels, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round.</p>\n<p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>"
