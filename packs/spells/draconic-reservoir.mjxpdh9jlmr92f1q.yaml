  shortDescription: >-
    <p><i>Draconic reservoir</i> functions as <i>protection from energy</i>,
    absorbing 6 points of one type of energy damage per caster level (acid,
    cold, electricity, or fire, maximum 60 points). Each round, as a swift
    action, the subject can release 1d6 points of the absorbed energy and apply
    it to any melee attack, as if using an <i>acidic</i>, <i>flaming</i>,
    <i>frost</i>, or <i>shock</i> weapon. The first creature the subject strikes
    with this attack takes the energy damage in addition to any other
    consequences of the attack.</p><p>Releasing energy in this way does not
    "free up" space to absorb still more energy; the maximum amount of energy
    the spell can absorb remains fixed. The subject cannot release more energy
    than he currently has absorbed. Once the subject has absorbed all the energy
    allowed by the spell, he takes damage as normal from that energy type. Once
    the energy has been released, the spell is discharged.</p><p><i>Draconic
    reservoir</i> does not stack with <i>protection from
    energy</i>.</p><p><i>Draconic reservoir</i> overlaps (and does not stack
    with) <i>resist energy</i>. If a character is warded by <i>draconic
    reservoir</i> and <i>resist energy</i>, <i>draconic reservoir</i> absorbs
    damage until it reaches its maximum limit.</p>
