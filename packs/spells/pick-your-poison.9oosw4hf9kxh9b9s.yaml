      <p>This spell temporarily converts even the deadliest poison affecting a
      creature into an intoxicating alcohol. If the subject is affected by a
      poison effect while under the effects of this spell, instead of the
      poison's normal effect, she feels intoxicated as if she'd just had a very
      strong drink and takes a -2 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks for the
      duration of the spell.</p><p>When the spell's duration expires, the
      penalty ends and the poison's normal effects apply. <i>Pick your
      poison</i> does not affect any poison effects that occurred before the
      spell was cast.</p>
