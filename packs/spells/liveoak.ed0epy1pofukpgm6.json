    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can only be cast on a single tree at a time; while <i>liveoak</i> is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. <i>Liveoak</i> must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The <i>liveoak</i> spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.</p><p>If <i>liveoak</i> is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.</p>"
