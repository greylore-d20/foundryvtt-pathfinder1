  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The effects of the alchemist’s plague bomb operate as normal except for
      the following changes. The chosen disease’s save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2
      the alchemist’s level + his Intelligence modifier. Any creatures affected
      by the chosen disease become vectors for it, spreading the disease to any
      creatures they come in physical contact with for a number of days equal to
      the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The save DC to avoid
      contracting the disease from the vector is the same as the DC used for
      this discovery.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 14th level and must have the plague bomb
      discovery to select this discovery.</p>
