      Arcana:</strong> Whenever you cast a spell of the <em>summoning</em>
      subschool, the creatures summoned gain <em>DR</em>/good equal to 1/2 your
      sorcerer level (minimum 1). This does not stack with any <em>DR</em> the
      creature might have.</p><p><strong>Bloodline Powers:</strong> While some
      would say that you are possessed, you know better. The demonic influence
      in your blood grows as you gain
      power.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.K8t4QuJhu4yXPgGJ]{Claws
      (Su)}: At 1st level, you can grow claws as a free action. These claws are
      treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a
      full attack action using your full base attack bonus. These attacks deal
      1d4 points of damage each (1d3 if you are Small) plus your Strength
      modifier. At 5th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the
      purpose of overcoming DR. At 7th level, the damage increases by one step
      to 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small). At 11th level, these claws
      become flaming weapons, each dealing an additional 1d6 points of fire
      damage on a successful hit. You can use your claws for a number of rounds
      per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. These rounds do not need to
      be
      consecutive.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.Q0rRzB0zUWSPM3JC]{Demon
      Resistances (Ex)}: At 3rd level, you gain resist electricity 5 and a +2
      bonus on saving throws made against poison. At 9th level, your resistance
      to electricity increases to 10 and your bonus on poison saving throws
      increases to
      +4.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.asX1tCPLkhm2UiwQ]{Strength
      of the Abyss (Ex)}: At 9th level, you gain a +2 inherent bonus to your
      Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 13th level, and to +6 at 17th
      level.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.DuAcRnjBmOADOvj2]{Added
      Summonings (Su)}: At 15th level, whenever you summon a creature with the
      demon subtype or the fiendish template using a summon monster spell, you
      summon one additional creature of the same
      kind.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.nRASOVnnyC6FJRMV]{Demonic
      Might (Su)}: At 20th level, the power of the Abyss flows through you. You
      gain immunity to electricity and poison. You also gain resistance to acid
      10, cold 10, and fire 10, and gain telepathy with a range of 60 feet
      (allowing you to communicate with any creature that can speak a
      language).</p>
