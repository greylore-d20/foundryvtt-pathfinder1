  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, a barbarian gains <em>damage reduction</em>. Subtract 1
      from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a
      weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian
      levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this <em>damage
      reduction</em> rises by 1 point. <em>Damage reduction</em> can reduce
      damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>
