  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You blast your enemies with a searing beam of fire. You may fire one
      ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a
      maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch
      attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired
      at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets
      within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.</p>
