      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.u2vipq48algenijz]{audiovisual
      hallucination}, except that this spell's phantasm has no apparent effect
      until a specific condition occurs. You must overcome the target's spell
      resistance to plant the <em>triggered hallucination</em>, but the target
      doesn't attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition
      occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with
      <em>audiovisual hallucination</em>). The phantasm can include auditory,
      olfactory, visual, tactile, and thermal elements, including intelligible
      speech. You set the triggering condition (such as hearing a certain word
      or seeing a type of creature) when casting the spell. The event that
      triggers the illusion can be as general or detailed as desired but must be
      based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger
      can't be based on any quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as
      alignment. <em>Triggered hallucination</em> uses the target's senses to
      notice triggers.</p>
