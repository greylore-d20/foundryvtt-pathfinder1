  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, your body becomes permanently suffused with
      the essence of the Shadow Plane. You gain regeneration 5 while in dim
      light or darkness and immunity to cold, critical hits, and sneak attacks.
      Your regeneration is suppressed while in any level of illumination
      brighter than dim light. In addition, any spells you cast of the shadow
      subschool or with the darkness descriptor are automatically enlarged
      without affecting their spell level.</p>
