  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Perhaps trained to remove or destroy restraints from slaves and
      prisoners by the Twilight Talons or Bellflower Network, a vigilante with
      this talent can choose to make no more noise than people talking when he
      attempts a sunder combat maneuver check or attempts a Strength check to
      break an object. He ignores half an objectâ€™s hardness when attempting
      sunder combat maneuver checks and when attacking nonmagical objects.</p>
