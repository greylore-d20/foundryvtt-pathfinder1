  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can spend 1 minute meditating on and communing with a masterwork
      object of any type. At the end of this time, you can speak with that item.
      This functions as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.wgm8mm1za909pwch]{Stone
      Tell}, except that it works with masterwork goods, and the item cannot
      tell you what it covers or conceals if that question is not applicable to
      it.</p>

      <p>You can speak with items in this way for a number of minutes equal to
      your oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it
      must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
