  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Using the Path of Numbers, you are able to influence the seemingly random
    elements in the environment around a creature, reducing that creature's
    efficacy. Roll 3d8 and choose one of the dice-this die's result is the
    penalty <i>mathematical curse</i> imparts. Next, choose either of the two
    remaining dice; the d20 roll corresponding to that result on the Eight Basic
    Energies table is the roll the spell's penalty applies to. The result of the
    final die represents the number of rounds that <i>mathematical curse</i>
    lasts. A creature can be under the influence of only one <i>mathematical
    curse</i> at a time. If <i>mathematical curse</i> is cast on a creature
    already affected by that spell, the new curse replaces the previous one.</p>
