  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can talk to wood and learn what it knows. You must spend 1 minute
      meditating on and communing with the wood. At the end of this time, you
      can speak with the wood. This functions as the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.wgm8mm1za909pwch]{Stone Tell} spell, except with
      wood instead of stones.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level. This duration
      does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute
      increments. You can speak with natural or worked wood.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
