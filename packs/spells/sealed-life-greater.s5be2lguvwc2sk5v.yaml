  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>sealed life</i>, except it additionally
      provides the benefits of <i>death ward</i> and renders its targets immune
      to effects that extract or transfer its soul, such as <i>possession</i>
      and <i>trap the soul</i>. This spell prevents a soul from returning to its
      body if it has already departed, until the spell's duration expires.</p>
