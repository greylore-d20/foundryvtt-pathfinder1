  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of
      multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other
      ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker
      must make an attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of
      concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not
      affected.</p>
