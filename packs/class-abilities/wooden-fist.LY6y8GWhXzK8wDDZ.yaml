  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a free action, your hands can become as hard as wood, covered in
      tiny thorns. While you have wooden fists, your unarmed strikes do not
      provoke attacks of opportunity, deal lethal damage, and gain a bonus on
      damage rolls equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum +1). You can use this
      ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
      These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
