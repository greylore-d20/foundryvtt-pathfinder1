They supplement this trail bread with dried fruits and nuts. If you are an elf who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you receive a +2 bonus on checks and saves that benefit from the Endurance feat. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day's worth.</p>\r\n"
