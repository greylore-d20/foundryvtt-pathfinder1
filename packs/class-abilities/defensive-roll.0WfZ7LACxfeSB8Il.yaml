  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With this advanced talent, the rogue can roll with a potentially lethal
      blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day,
      when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat
      (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue
      can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must
      attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds,
      she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full
      damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order
      to execute her defensive rollâ€”if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC,
      she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a
      character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion
      ability does not apply to the defensive roll.</p>
