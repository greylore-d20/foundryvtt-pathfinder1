    value: >-
      <p>Capricious fey constantly bedevil you, playing pranks on you such as
      tying your shoelaces together, hiding your gear, making inappropriate
      noises or smells at formal events, and mimicking your voice to tell
      embarrassing lies. In addition to any social consequences of such
      mischief, you take a –4 penalty on initiative checks. Furthermore,
      whenever you attempt to retrieve a stored item from your gear, there’s a
      25% chance that you fail to find it with that action. Add
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.bl71og1gklwncmt7]{Faerie Fire} and
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mtxqp85izkb20djq]{Ghost Sound} to your list of
      spells known.</p>

      and @Compendium[pf1.spells.27o3msobhyghmfid]{Minor Image} to your list of
      spells known.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.n0bsyxchnigkkuqo]{Confusion}
      to your list of spells known as a 5th-level spell.</p>

      curse in place of the haunted curse.</p>
