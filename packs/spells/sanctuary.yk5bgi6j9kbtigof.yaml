  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even with
    a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the
    opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell.
    If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that
    part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature
    for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Those not attempting to attack the
    subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature
    from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot
    attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise
    act.</p>
