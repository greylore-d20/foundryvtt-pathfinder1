  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell creates an explosion of conjured metal pellets, striking
    everything within its area and dealing 1d8 points of piercing damage per two
    caster levels, maximum 5d8. This damage is subject to damage reduction. If
    the material component is made of cold iron (costing 50 gp), silver (costing
    20 gp), or adamantine (costing 100 gp), the resulting blast can overcome
    damage reduction of the appropriate type. The pellets disappear after the
    spell is cast and the damage is dealt.</p>
