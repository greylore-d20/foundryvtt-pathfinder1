      Slow-firing, touch</p><h3>Description</h3><p>An id rifle looks like a
      sleek, low-caliber rifle made of burnished skymetal. It fires a tiny barb
      of solid nanites with a range increment of 50 feet. Although this barb
      does minimal damage on a hit, any creature damaged by an id rifle barb
      must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or have its central nervous
      system flooded with nanites that swiftly overwhelm the creature's brain,
      reducing its mind to the instinctive level of an animal. The victim takes
      1d4 points of Intelligence damage each round, but the total amount of
      damage taken can never equal the victim's actual Intelligence score. Each
      round after the first, the victim can resist the Intelligence damage by
      succeeding at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw, at which point the damage
      ceases. The recurring Intelligence damage automatically ends after 6
      rounds. A victim already suffering from the effects of an id rifle who is
      affected by an additional shot has the save DC increased by 2 per
      additional shot.</p><p>An id rifle has a microphone built into its stock.
      During any round in which a creature takes Intelligence damage from an id
      rifle, as a move action the wielder of that rifle can speak a short
      command into the microphone. Any applicable target within 50 feet of the
      wielder must then succeed at a DC 16 Will save to resist following the
      command, as if under the effect of a <em>suggestion</em> spell. A victim
      follows only the latest suggestion spoken into the microphone, and
      abandons any previous suggestion if it fails a saving throw against a new
      suggestion. A victim continues to follow the suggestion for up to 5 hours
      after succumbing to its effects.</p><p>The effects created by an id rifle
      are mind-affecting
