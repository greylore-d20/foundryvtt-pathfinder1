For example, if the linked spell were&nbsp;nondetection, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell’s duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell’s DCs by 4.</p>"
