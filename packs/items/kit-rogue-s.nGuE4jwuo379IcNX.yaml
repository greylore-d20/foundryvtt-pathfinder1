            <p>A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that one prong
            always faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter
            caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or
            are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of
            caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.</p><p>Each time a creature
            moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting
            while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on
            one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0)
            against the creature. For this attack, the creature’s shield, armor,
            and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing
            shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the
            attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop
            deals 1 point of damage, and the creature’s speed is reduced by half
            because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24
            hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal
            check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A
            charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a
            caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its
            way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p><p>Caltrops may
            not work against unusual opponents.</p>

            <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot
            radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional
            20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light
            becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in
            normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it
            as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
            equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire
            damage.</p>

            <p>This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom
            and one side to create a bag for sleeping in. Some have cloth straps
            along the open side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are
            sleeping. It can be rolled and tied into a tight coil for storage or
            transport. Most people use a <em>blanket</em> with the bedroll to
            stay warm or provide a ground cushion.</p>
