  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as per <i>entangle</i>, except it sets the foliage
    on fire. A creature that begins its turn <i>entangle</i>d by the spell takes
    4d6 points of fire damage (Reflex half), and a creature that begins its turn
    in the area but is not <i>entangle</i>d takes 2d6 points of fire damage
    (Reflex negates). Smoke rising from the vines partially obscures visibility.
    Creatures can see things in the smoke within 5 feet clearly, but attacks
    against anything farther away in the smoke must contend with concealment
    (20% miss chance). When the spell's duration expires, the vines burn away
    entirely.</p>
