    <p>This spell functions like @Compendium[pf1.spells.fmuea6pmgrylbux7]{arcane
    eye}, except as noted above. Upon casting this spell, you fall asleep for
    its duration, creating an invisible magic sensor (called a dreamscryer) that
    is the exact size and shape of your body, is recognizable as you, and cannot
    pass through spaces that your body cannot enter. Unlike the invisible sensor
    created by <em>arcane eye</em>, children of any race (no older than the
    human equivalent of 10) and animals can see your dreamscryer. Sleeping
    creatures can sense its presence and might incorporate your image into their
    dreams. Force effects and abjuration spells that ward out creatures (such as
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.1i8b1v3dngkxj6jp]{magic circle against evil}) are
    effective barriers against a dreamscryer (regardless of your creature type,
    alignment, or other specifics). If you dismiss the spell or the dreamscryer
    is dispelled or destroyed, you awaken.</p>
