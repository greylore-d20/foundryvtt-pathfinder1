  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monk who selects this ki power must select one type of energy: acid,
      cold, electricity, or fire. Once this choice is made, it cannot be
      changed.</p>

      <p>The monk can expend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to imbue
      his natural attacks with this energy, causing them to deal 1d6 points of
      damage of the chosen type for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 his monk
      level.</p>

      <p>A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this ki power.</p>
