  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The Gray Maidensâ€™ distinctive armor is one of their most iconic
      identifiers. Gray Maiden plate is mechanically identical to full plate,
      and any effect that functions with full plate functions with Gray Maiden
      plate. Certain options for Gray Maidens function only when they wear Gray
      Maiden plate.</p>
