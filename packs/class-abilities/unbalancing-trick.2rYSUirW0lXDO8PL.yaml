      <p><strong>Source</strong> Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 9</p><p>The
      rogue gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.gTrGPxzN054GfpkM]{Improved Trip} as a
      bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, she
      is treated as if she meets all the prerequisites of
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.lNyMFFQaOxxTOW7M]{Greater Trip} (although she must
      take the feat as normal to gain its benefits).</p>
