  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm
      neither you nor your equipment.</p><p>In addition to providing
      illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can
      strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to
      1d6 + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl
      the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack
      with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same
      damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a
      new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining
      duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0
      minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.</p><p>This
      spell does not function underwater.</p>
