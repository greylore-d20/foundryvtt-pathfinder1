      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, whenever the samurai is on his mount, both he and his mount share any of the following senses if either of them possesses it: darkvision, low-light vision, scent, and see in darkness. This applies regardless of the source of the sense (including senses gained from spells or magic items), but only while the samurai is mounted. If the samurai and mount both have a sense but one has an improved version (such as a samurai with darkvision with a range of 60 feet riding a mount that has darkvision with a range of 90 feet), both receive the improved version of the sense.</p>"
