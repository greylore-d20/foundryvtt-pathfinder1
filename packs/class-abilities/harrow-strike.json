If your attack hits, instead of dealing sneak attack damage as normal, you deal a number of points of ability damage equal to your number of sneak attack dice. The ability score damaged is the score affiliated with the suit of the harrow card drawn. You can use this ability an additional time per day at 15th level and 20th level.</p>"
