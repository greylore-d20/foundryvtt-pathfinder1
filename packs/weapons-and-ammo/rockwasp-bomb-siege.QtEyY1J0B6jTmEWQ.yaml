  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Usable in catapults and trebuchets, this ammunition consists of a
      wooden crate packed with wax globes, from which a faint buzzing sound
      emanates.</p><p>Visible as a dark shape at the center of each globe is a
      rat-sized hornet known as a rockwasp. The alchemical wax keeps the wasps
      immobilized, while tiny air holes allow them to breath.</p><p>This
      ammunition deals only half damage, but releases a wasp swarm-two wasp
      swarms if used for a heavy catapult or heavy trebuchet. The wasps attack
      for 1 minute before dispersing.</p><h3>Mishap</h3><p>On a siege engine
      mishap, the wasps escape before the ammunition is launched.</p>
