      <p>These translucent, salty fish eggs are a delicacy. They are usually
      eaten as a spread on crackers, boiled eggs, bread, pastries, or
      vegetables. They tend to spoil quickly and are rare outside of the coastal
      areas where they are harvested. Purists only consider sturgeon eggs to be
      true caviar, but others are more relaxed about the definition and include
      salmon, trout, and whitefish eggs as caviar. In some countries, the roe of
      larger exotic fish and sea creatures (such as chuul, giant gar, and
      reefclaws) are eaten as caviar, though at much higher prices.</p>
