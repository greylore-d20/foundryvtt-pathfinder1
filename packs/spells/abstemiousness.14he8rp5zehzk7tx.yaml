      <p>Sometimes Irori smiles on his worshipers, granting them a reprieve from
      physical hunger. This spell magically enhances a handful of simple food,
      imbuing it with enough nutrition to satisfy a Medium or smaller creature
      for a full day. The spell does not create food, and thus will not alone
      prevent someone from starving, but it can extend even limited reserves for
      lengthy periods.</p>
