      "value": "<p>Your chanting grants protection against your enemies. As a move action, you can begin chanting to gain the benefit of a protection spell (such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.skgjjub1hng29nwo]{Protection From Evil}) using your oracle level as your caster level. This protection lasts until you stop chanting or for the spell’s normal duration, whichever comes first. Chanting after the initial round of the effect is a free action, and you can incorporate verbal components and communication into the chant; magical silence ends a chant and its protection effect.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can chant aloud to create a magic circle effect (such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.1i8b1v3dngkxj6jp]{Magic Circle against Evil}).</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>"
