  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This character may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as
      natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her
      normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
      Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated
      to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>
