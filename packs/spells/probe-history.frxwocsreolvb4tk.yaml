  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You gain a glimpse of a potential reality similar to this one but that
    never was. If the target fails her Will save, you can ask about one topic
    and attempt the appropriate Knowledge check with a +5 competence bonus;
    track Knowledge checks attempted with this spell separately for the purpose
    of disallowing retries on Knowledge checks. You learn information on that
    topic from a reality in which you were an acquaintance of the target,
    although the differences in that reality might cause the answer to be subtly
    different than in your own. Once you have probed a target's history,
    successfully or not, you cannot target the same creature's history or search
    for the same information in another creature's history.</p>
