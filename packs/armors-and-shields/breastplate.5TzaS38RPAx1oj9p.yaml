  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A breastplate protects a wearerâ€™s torso with a single piece of sculpted
      metal, similar to the core piece of a suit of full plate. Despite its
      sturdiness, its inflexibility and open back make it inferior to complete
      suits of metal armor, but still an improvement over most non-metal
      armors.</p>
