      <p>You fill an enemy's head with waking dreams, a reminder of the
      pleasures, delights, and terrors to be found in the dream world. While in
      this strange dream state, the target moves at half its normal speed (round
      down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping
      distance as normal for decreased speed.</p><p>Multiple <i>Haze of
      Dreams</i> effects do not stack, nor does this spell's effect stack with
