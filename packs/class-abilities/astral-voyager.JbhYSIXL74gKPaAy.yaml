  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you can send your consciousness to the <em>Astral
      Plane</em> once per day. This functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zk8l7i27fhfic3c1]{Astral Projection, Lesser} and
      allows you to bring with you up to one additional willing creature for
      every 2 <em>sorcerer</em> levels you have. At 13th level, you can cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.q3st18udsalnyz5v]{Plane Shift} once per day, but
      only on yourself and willing targets that accompany you, and only from the
      <em>Material Plane</em> to the <em>Astral Plane</em> and vice versa. At
      17th level, the @Compendium[pf1.spells.zk8l7i27fhfic3c1]{Astral
      Projection, Lesser} ability instead functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.lnahlmp5mih2ongh]{Astral Projection}.</p>
