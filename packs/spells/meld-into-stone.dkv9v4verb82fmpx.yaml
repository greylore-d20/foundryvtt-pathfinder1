  shortDescription: >-
    <p><i>Meld into stone</i> enables you to meld your body and possessions into
    a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your
    body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more
    than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition
    is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.</p><p>While in the stone, you
    remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which
    you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on
    yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone
    can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical
    damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the
    extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points
    of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you
    instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your
    save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.</p><p>Any time before the
    duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you
    entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before
    you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6
    points of damage.</p><p>The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone
    that you are occupying. <i>Stone to flesh</i> expels you and deals you 5d6
    points of damage. Stone <i>shape</i> deals 3d6 points of damage but does not
    expel you. <i>Transmute rock to mud</i> expels you and then slays you
    instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are
    merely expelled. Finally, <i>passwall</i> expels you without damage.</p>
