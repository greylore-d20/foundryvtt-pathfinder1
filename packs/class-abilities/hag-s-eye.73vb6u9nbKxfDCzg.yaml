  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A witch with this hex can create a magic sensor that she can see
      through. This functions as per the spell
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.fmuea6pmgrylbux7]{Arcane Eye}. If the witch has the
      coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet who also have the coven hex
      can see through this sensor as well, although the witch that created it
      still controls it.</p>

      <p>The witch can use this eye for a number of minutes per day equal to her
      level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent
      in 1-minute increments.</p>
