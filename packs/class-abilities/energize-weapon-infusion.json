You imbue the chosen weapon with your elemental energy as part of an attack action, charge action, or full-attack action to add extra damage to each of your attacks with that weapon until the beginning of your next turn. Your attacks with the chosen weapon during that action deal 1d6 additional points of damage.</p>\n<p>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus damage increases by 1d6 points.</p>\n<p>Blue flame blasts deal double this additional damage. The additional damage is of the same type as the infused blast’s damage. This additional damage ignores spell resistance and doesn’t apply any modifiers to your kinetic blast’s damage (such as your Constitution modifier).</p>"
