Flak ammunition is packed with  steel balls and black powder, and may be fired from a bombard  or catapult. When flak explodes, it deals 4d6 points of piercing  and bludgeoning damage to all creatures and objects within 40  feet of the target square. A flak bomb must reach an altitude of  at least 50 feet to function properly. If flak ammunition impacts  anything before it reaches this altitude, the bomb deals 1d6  points of bludgeoning damage and fails to explode.</p>"
