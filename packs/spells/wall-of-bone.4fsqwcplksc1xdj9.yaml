      <p>This spell creates a vertical wall of skeletal arms that attaches
      itself to any solid surface. The <i>Wall of Bone</i> works identically to
      <i>Wall of Stone</i> e xcept a s n oted a bove a nd i n t his s pell
      description. The <i>Wall of Bone</i> is 1 inch thick per 4 caster levels
      and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. The wall created must
      be vertical, and must rest upon a firm foundation. It cannot be used to
      bridge a chasm, for instance, or to act as a ramp. Each 5-foot square of
      the wall has hardness 4 and 7 hit points per inch of thickness. A section
      of wall whose hit points drops to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to
      break through the wall with a single attack, the DC of the Strength check
      is equal to 15 + 2 per inch of thickness.  For each creature adjacent to
      the wall, the skeletal hands attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple
      it. The skeletal hands do not provoke attacks of opportunity. They make
      their attacks at the start of your turn, when the wall is summoned, or
      when an enemy first moves adjacent to the wall. The skeletal hands' CMB is
      equal to your caster level, and they can grapple a Huge or smaller
      creature with no penalty.  If the wall successfully grapples a foe, that
      foe takes 1d6 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled
      opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other
      movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The
      wall cannot move or pin foes. Each round the wall succeeds at a grapple
      combat maneuver check, it deals 1d6 additional points of damage. The CMD
      of the wall, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 +
      its CMB.</p>
