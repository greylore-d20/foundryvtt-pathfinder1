        be placed on melee weapons. Once per round, when the wielder damages a
        creature in melee with an<em>advancing</em>weapon, she can take a 5-foot
        step as a swift action after the attack but before the end of her turn.
        This movement does not count against her ability to move or take a
        5-foot step earlier or later in the round, though using this ability
        imposes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next
        turn. This ability may not be used in conjunction with any other ability
        or effect that allows moving as part of an
        attack.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        +2 bonus; <strong>Weight</strong>—</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This
        special ability can only be added to a melee weapon or a thrown weapon.
        An <em>anchoring </em>weapon pins a target in place and prevents it from
        moving. As a swift action, the weapon can be fixed in place in a point
        in space, functioning as an <em>immovable rod</em>. This ability can
        also be used when the wielder hits a creature with a melee attack using
        an <em>anchoring </em>weapon. This anchors the target to the weapon,
        preventing it from moving away from the weapon. The target is not
        entangled or paralyzed; it simply cannot move from its location without
        first destroying the weapon or making a successful DC 30 Strength check
        as a full-round action to move with the weapon up to 10 feet. An
        <em>anchoring </em>weapon remains motionless and cannot be used to
        attack while it is anchoring a creature. An <em>anchoring </em>weapon
        has no effect on amorphous creatures, including elementals, oozes, and
        creatures in gaseous or liquid form. It also cannot anchor incorporeal
        creatures unless the weapon also has the <em>ghost touch </em>special
        ability.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        weapon causes an unattended flammable object to ignite when struck
        (Fortitude DC 13 negates for magic items), dealing 1d6+1 points of fire
        damage to the object each round after it’s ignited. An item made mostly
        or entirely out of wood is even more susceptible to this effect, taking
        2d6+2 points of fire damage. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A
        creature that ends its turn in the same space as a burning object takes
        1d6+1 points of fire damage.</p><p>Up to three times per day, the bearer
        of a <em>burning</em> weapon can, on command, cause a single object that
        has been ignited by the weapon to burn even brighter, increasing the
        duration of its burning effect by 1d4+1 rounds and causing the fire to
        expand in a burst that extends 5 feet from the object. This burst of

        <strong>Weight</strong>—</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This special ability
        can be placed only on a light or one-handed melee weapon. A
        <em>concealed</em> weapon alters its shape at its wielder’s command,
        transforming into a non-weapon object of the wielder’s choice. This
        object must be a mundane item whose size and shape is similar to that of
        the concealed weapon or smaller, and it must be sized for a creature of
        the same size as the weapon’s intended wielder. For example, a Medium
        short sword can transform into a quill sized for a Medium creature, but
        it cannot transform into a saw sized for a Small creature. A
        <em>concealed</em> weapon cannot transform into a consumable item, and
        if its alternate form is that of a container, any contents stored within
        the concealed weapon’s alternate form are ejected into the wielder’s
        space when the weapon transforms back to its original form.<br /><br
        />While transformed, a <em>concealed</em> weapon doesn’t register as
        magical, as per <em>magic aura</em>, though it retains the weight, hit
        points, and any hardness of its original form. A <em>concealed</em>
        weapon cannot assume the form of an object made from a special material
        (such as adamantine) unless it is already made of that material. For
        instance, a wooden club cannot transform into a mithral frying pan, but
        a mithral dagger can.<br /><br />Transforming a <em>concealed</em>
        weapon into a mundane form requires a standard action, while returning
        it to its weapon form requires a move action. This transformation lasts
        until it is changed back into its original form or has been left
        unattended for 8 hours, whichever comes
        sooner.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        <em>conductive</em> weapon is able to channel the energy of a spelllike
        or supernatural ability that relies on a melee or ranged touch attack to
        hit its target (such as from a cleric’s domain granted power, sorcerer’s
        bloodline power, oracle’s mystery revelation, or wizard’s arcane school
        power). When the wielder makes a successful attack of the appropriate
        type, he may choose to expend two uses of his magical ability to channel
        it through the weapon to the struck opponent, which suffers the effects
        of both the weapon attack and the special ability. (If the wielder has
        unlimited uses of a special ability, she may channel through the weapon
        every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with
        her <em>conductive greatsword</em> can expend two uses of her lay on
        hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal both
        greatsword damage and damage from one use of lay on hands. A given
        character can use this weapon special ability only once per round (even
        if she has several <em>conductive</em> weapons), and the power works
        only with magical abilities of the same type as the weapon (melee or
        ranged).</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed it
        and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity,
        and the activating character it is not considered armed with the weapon.
        The weapon is considered wielded or attended by the activating character
        for all maneuvers and effects that target items. While dancing, the
        weapon shares the same space as the activating character and can attack
        adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet
        away). The <em>dancing</em> weapon accompanies the activating character
        everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the
        activating character has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it
        is attacking on its own as a free action; when so retrieved, the weapon
        can’t dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds. This special ability
        can only be placed on melee
        weapons.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        <strong>Weight</strong>—</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A <em>dueling
        weapon</em> bears magical enhancements that makes it particularly
        effective at performing certain combat maneuvers. When a <em>dueling
        weapon</em> is used to perform a combat maneuver that utilizes the
        weapon only (see below), it grants a luck bonus equal to twice its
        enhancement bonus on the CMB check made to carry out the maneuver. The
        <em>dueling weapon</em> also grants this same luck bonus to the
        wielder’s CMD score against these types of combat maneuvers. These
        combat maneuvers include disarm and trip maneuvers, but not bull rush,
        grapple, or overrun maneuvers. If you’re using the additional combat
        maneuvers in the <em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>, this also includes
        any dirty trick maneuvers that utilize the weapon, as well as reposition
        combat maneuvers, but not drag or steal combat maneuvers. Note that this
        luck bonus stacks with the weapon’s enhancement bonus, which in and of
        itself adds to CMB checks
        normally.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        the hands of a particularly wise wielder. A character who attacks with a
        guided weapon modifies his attack rolls and weapon damage rolls with his
        Wisdom modifier, not his Strength modifier. This modifier to damage is
        not adjusted for two-handed weapons or off-hand weapons—it always
        remains equal to the wielder’s Wisdom modifier. A guided weapon may be
        wielded as a normal weapon, using Strength to modify attack and damage
        rolls, but this goes against the weapon’s nature and imparts a –2

        <strong>Weight</strong>—</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This special ability
        can only be placed on melee weapons. A <em>lifesurge</em> weapon boosts
        and sustains the wielder’s life energy while he is in the throes of
        combat. The wielder gains a bonus on saving throws against necromantic
        effects—including the ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain
        powers of the undead—equal to the weapon’s enhancement bonus. In
        addition, whenever the wielder receives temporary hit points from any
        source, he adds the weapon’s enhancement bonus to these temporary hit
        points; this does not stack for temporary hit points from multiple
        sources, and these points are lost if the <em>lifesurge</em> weapon is
        not being wielded.<br /><br />In combat, the weapon’s critical threat
        range is doubled abilities against undead; this does not stack with the
        <em>keen</em> special ability or Improved Critical. Whenever a
        <em>lifesurge</em> weapon confirms a critical hit against an undead
        creature, it erupts with 1d8 points of positive energy (2d8 for weapons
        with a critical multiplier of ×3, 3d8 if it is ×4); the wielder may
        choose to deal this as damage to an undead target or to absorb half this
        amount as healing, with the remaining positive energy
        dissipating.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong>

        pg. 423</em>, <em>Pathfinder #5: Sins of the Saviors pg. 57</em><br
        /><strong>Aura</strong> strong (two variable schools)
        <strong>CL</strong> 13th<br /><strong>Price</strong> +2 bonus;
        <strong>Weight</strong>—</p><h3>Description</h3><p>During Thassilon’s
        height, many of the empire’s greatest soldiers, mercenaries, and arcane
        assassins wielded weapons infused with two allied schools of magic that
        worked together to grant the wielder additional prowess over
        practitioners of an opposing school of magic. Weapons steeped in
        enchantment and illusion magic, for example, held great power over
        wielders of transmutation. Such weapons were often banned in Thassilon,
        so wary were the runelords of their propagation, yet all seven kept
        champions and assassins armed with <em>runeforged weapons</em> targeting
        their enemies’ weaknesses in secret.<br /><br />Each <em>runeforged
        weapon</em> opposes a school of magic. T he wielder gains a +2 morale
        bonus on all saving throws against spells from the weapon’s opposed
        magic. All runeforged weapons are, to a certain degree, empathic. They
        enhance sin or virtue in those who wield them, so a fighter armed with a
        <em>dominant weapon</em> becomes more domineering than before, for
        example. Anyone wielding a <em>runeforged weapon</em> takes a –2 penalty
        on all Diplomacy checks, as her vices or virtues are magnified at the
        expense of personality. No weapon can have more than one <em>runeforged
        weapon</em> quality at a time, and a creature that carries two
        <em>runeforged weapons</em>(even those o f the same type) takes a –5
        penalty on all attack rolls, Will saving throws, and skill checks, as
        her mind is constantly assailed by multiple empathic urges.<br /><br
        />Each of the seven Thassilonian schools of magic is opposed by a single
        <em>runeforged weapon</em> quality—each of these being the combination
        of that school’s opposition schools. The seven correct component
        combinations and the type of <em>runeforged weapon</em> each combination
        creates are listed below. Note that the first name for each type of
        weapon listed is its sinful name— the second is the name a virtuous
        character can use to refer to the weapon. In any event, a <em>runeforged
        weapon</em> functions the same, regardless of whether it magnifies a
        wielder’s sin or virtue.<br /><br />A wielder who is considered sinful
        or virtuous (see page 416) with the same type of sin/virtue as a
        <em>runeforged weapon</em> he wields becomes more aware of danger around
        him—gaining a +2 insight bonus on Initiative checks and a +1 dodge bonus
        to AC.<br /><br />The specific effects of each of the seven types of
        runeforged weapons are listed below.<br /><br
        /><strong>Covetous/Charitable (opposes evocation)</strong>: A union of
        conjuration and abjuration magic, a <em>covetous weapon</em> functions
        as a <em>bane weapon</em> against evokers and creatures with the fire
        subtype. As long as the weapon is wielded, the wielder gains fire
        resistance 5.<br /><br /><strong>Dominant/Commanding (opposes
        transmutation)</strong>: A union of enchantment and illusion magic, a
        <em>dominant weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against
        transmuters and against creatures with the shapechanger subtype. As long
        as the weapon is carried, it can absorb up to three harmful
        transmutation effects (such as <em>baleful polymorph</em> or
        <em>petrification</em>) inflicted on the wielder per day.<br /><br
        /><strong>Jealous/Trusting (opposes necromancy)</strong>: A union of
        abjuration and enchantment magic, a <em>jealous weapon</em> functions as
        a <em>bane weapon</em> against necromancers and against undead created
        by necromancy spells (not against self-manifested undead or undead
        created by the create spawn special ability). As long as the weapon is
        carried, it can absorb up to 3 negative levels inflicted on the wielder
        per day.<br /><br /><strong>Miserly/Generous (opposes
        illusion)</strong>: A union of transmutation and conjuration magic, a
        miserly weapon functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against illusionists
        and creatures from the Plane of Shadow. The first three times each day
        that this weapon strikes an illusion, it automatically makes a
        <em>dispel magic</em> attempt to dispel the illusion.<br /><br
        /><strong>Parasitic/Symbiotic (opposes enchantment)</strong>: A union of
        necromancy and transmutation magic, a <em>parasitic weapon</em>
        functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against enchanters and against
        creatures that are charmed, dominated, or otherwise under another
        creature’s magic control. The first time each day that this weapon
        strikes a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell, it
        automatically makes a <em>dispel magic</em> attempt to dispel the
        enchantment. If the attempt is successful, it siphons that energy into
        the wielder, healing her of 6d6 points of damage (hit points in excess
        of maximum are gained as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour).<br
        /><br /><strong>Sadistic/Compassionate (opposes abjuration)</strong>: A
        union of evocation and necromancy magic, a <em>sadistic weapon</em>
        functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against abjurers and any creatures
        with an active abjuration spell effect. A <em>sadistic weapon</em>
        shrouds its wielder in an aura of mock magic—when the wielder is
        subjected to a dispelling effect, that dispelling attempt instead
        targets only the aura of mock magic. If the aura is dispelled, it
        replenishes again in 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong>Tyrannical/Liberal
        (opposes conjuration)</strong>: A union of illusion and evocation magic,
        a <em>tyrannical weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against
        conjurers and summoned monsters. The first three times each day that the
        weapon scores a critical hit against a creature with the extraplanar
        subtype, the weapon casts <em>dismissal</em> at the creature
        struck.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> see

        the wielder rolls a critical threat against the target, she can forgo
        confirming the critical hit (dealing normal damage) to instead
        automatically learn what combat spells are active on the target. For the
        purposes of this ability, a combat spell is any spell that grants a
        bonus to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, movement, or Armor Class, or
        on attack rolls, damage rolls, or saving throws.<br /><br />The wielder
        can then attempt a check to siphon one of the combat spells of her
        choice. This check uses either the wielder’s caster level or the
        wielder’s base attack bonus plus the weapon’s enhancement bonus, and is
        attempted against a DC of 11 + the targeted spell’s caster level. If the
        wielder succeeds, the target immediately loses access to the spell being
        siphoned, and the wielder gains the effects of the spell for its
        remaining duration or 1 minute, whichever is shorter. If the <em>spell
        siphon</em> weapon has a critical multiplier greater than ×2, the
        wielder can attempt to siphon one additional combat spell for each
        additional multiplier beyond 2 (two spells for ×3, three for ×4, and so
        on).</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        storing</em> weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted
        spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting
        time of 1 standard action.) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and
        the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the
        spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This
        special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell
        from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.)
        Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any
        other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically
        imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it.
        A randomly rolled <em>spell storing</em> weapon has a 50% chance of
        having a spell stored in it already. This special ability can only be

        it to herself. When the wielder rolls a critical threat against a

        automatically learn which spells or magical effects are active upon the
        target. The wielder may then make a caster level check to steal her
        choice of one of those effects, using the <em>spellstealing</em>
        weapon’s caster level plus its enhancement bonus, against a DC of 11 +
        the caster level of the effect. If the check succeeds, the target
        immediately loses the benefits of that effect and the wielder gains the
        effect for 1 minute (or until the effect expires, whichever comes
        first). If the <em>spellstealing</em> weapon has a critical multiplier
        greater than ×2, the wielder may attempt to steal one additional spell
        effect per additional multiple beyond ×2 (two effects for ×3, and so

        weapon’s enhancement bonus is 2 better than its actual bonus. It also
        deals 2d6 additional points of damage against such foes. When combined
        with abilities like <em>bane</em> or <em>blood-hunting</em>, the
        enhancement bonus increases granted by these abilities do not stack, but
        an additional 1d6 points of damage are added to the additional damage

        greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is
        a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very
        similar to a Medium longsword; a Small <em>transformative
        greatsword</em> can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a
        Medium creature without the –2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong
        size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement
        bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its
        current shape. For example, a <em>keen transformative weapon</em>
        functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but
        cannot use the keen special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning
        weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its true
        shape.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        can be placed only on a melee weapon. A <em>truthful</em> weapon
        unerringly pierces concealment provided by illusions, allowing the
        wielder to ignore the miss chance provided by illusions such as
        <em>blur, displacement</em>, and <em>invisibility</em>. Attacks with a
        <em>truthful</em> weapon against a creature affected by <em>mirror
        image</em> or a similar figment always attack the real target. This
        ability allows the wielder to ignore the miss chance, not to otherwise
        detect the target. When attacking an invisible creature, for instance,
        the wielder might still need to guess the target’s location.<br /><br
        />In addition to its other abilities, a <em>truthful</em> weapon
        functions as a special kind of <em>dispelling</em><sup><em>
        UE</em></sup> weapon against figments and shadow conjuration effects; if
        the wielder makes an attack against such an effect, the weapon
        automatically attempts to use the stored <em>dispel magic</em> against
        the illusion. If the attempt fails, the wielder is not aware of the
        attempt, and unless she disbelieves the illusion or the illusion’s
        duration ends, the weapon continues to impart that it is storing
        <em>dispel magic</em>(though she is free to cast <em>dispel magic</em>
        on the weapon again if she has another reason to believe the effect was
        expended and failed to dispel an
        illusion).</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong>

        can be placed only on a melee weapon with a hilt or handle. An
        <em>umbral</em> weapon does not reflect any sources of ambient light and
        is perpetually cloaked in shadow. It is considered to have concealment
        for the purposes of attacks or effects directed at the weapon, such as
        combat maneuver checks made to disarm, steal<sup>APG</sup>or sunder it
        and <em>disintegrate</em> or <em>rusting grasp</em>. The wielder gains
        darkvision 30 feet while grasping the hilt or handle of the weapon, even
        if the weapon is not drawn.<br /><br />Upon command, an <em>umbral</em>
        weapon radiates darkness in a 20-foot radius, causing illumination in
        the area to drop by one step (from bright light to normal light, normal
        light to dim light, or dim light to darkness). Due to the darkvision
        granted by the weapon, the wielder’s vision is not impaired by darkness
        created by an umbral weapon. The darkness shed by an <em>umbral</em>
        weapon is considered a 2nd-level spell effect for the purpose of
        comparing its effect to the effects of magical light sources. This
        darkness suppresses light spells, but can’t be used to counter or dispel
        them. The weapon must be drawn and in the wielder’s hand to radiate
        darkness. The darkness ends immediately if the weapon is dropped,
        disarmed, sheathed, or otherwise
        stowed.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        point of bleed damage when it hits a creature. Multiple hits from a
        <em>wounding</em> weapon increase the bleed damage. Bleeding creatures
        take the bleed damage at the start of their turns. Bleeding can be
        stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or through the application of
        any spell that cures hit point damage. A critical hit does not multiply
        the bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the
        bleed damage dealt by this
        weapon.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        round or against a creature that is unaware of the wielder’s presence.
