  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to
      surround yourself with a planar ward. Creatures not native to the plane
      that you are currently on take a â€“4 penalty on attacks against you, and
      you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against the spells,
      spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of such creatures. This
      ward lasts for 1 minute.</p>
