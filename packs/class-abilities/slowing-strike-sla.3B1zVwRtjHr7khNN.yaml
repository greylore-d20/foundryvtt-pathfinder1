  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An opponent damaged by the slayer’s sneak attack has its speed halved
      for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect
      (DC = 10 + 1/2 of the slayer’s level + the slayer’s Intelligence
      modifier). Against creatures with multiple types of movement, the slayer
      must choose which movement type to affect. If the slayer affects a
      creature’s flight movement, its maneuverability is reduced by one step; if
      it’s airborne at the time, it falls unless it succeeds at a DC 10 Fly
      check.</p>

      <p>If the slayer targets a creature already affected by this ability, its
      speed and maneuverability are not further reduced; the slayer may either
      extend the duration of that effect by 1d4 rounds or choose another
      movement type to affect (keeping track of the duration of each affected
      movement separately).</p>
