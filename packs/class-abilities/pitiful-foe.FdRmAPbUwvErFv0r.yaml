      <p>You can temporarily curse one target within 30 feet as a standard
      action, making it pitiful and ineffective in battle. While this ability is
      in effect, the target is never considered to be threatening you or your
      allies, even if it is armed and you or your allies are standing in a
      square into which it can make a melee attack. If the target rolls a
      natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw, the attack or saving throw
      is not an automatic success (as would be normal) and whether it is
      successful is instead determined normally. Additionally, the target
      automatically fails all rolls to confirm critical hits. This curse lasts
      for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will
      saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse
      effect.</p>

      <p>You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at
      7th and 15th levels.</p>
