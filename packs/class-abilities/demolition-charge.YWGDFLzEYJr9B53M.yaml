    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal damage
      to an object as if by a sunder combat maneuver. If the item is worn or
      held by an opponent, the item is considered the direct target, and the
      wearer/holder takes splash damage from the blast. If the object is
      unattended, a demolition charge deals an additional 2d6 points of damage
      on a direct hit. This bonus doesn’t affect the bomb’s splash damage.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
