  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the shaman causes stardust to materialize around
      one creature within 30 feet. This stardust causes the target to shed light
      as a candle, and it cannot benefit from concealment or any invisibility
      effects. The creature takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based
      Perception checks.</p>

      <p>This penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks increases by 1 at
      4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of –6 at 20th
      level.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the shaman’s
      level (minimum 1). Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this
      ability.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      her Charisma modifier.</p>
