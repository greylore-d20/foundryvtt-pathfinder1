As a standard action, he may touch a creature and apply 1 round’s effect of his spontaneous healing discovery to that creature; this counts toward his spontaneous healing limit for the day. The alchemist’s daily limit for hit points healed by spontaneous healing increases to 5 × his alchemist level. This ability only functions if the target is the same type of creature (humanoid, undead, and so on) as the alchemist.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level and must have the spontaneous healing discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.</p>"
