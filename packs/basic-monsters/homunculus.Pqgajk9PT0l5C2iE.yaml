          <p>A construct is an animated object or artificially created
          creature.</p>

          <h2>Features</h2>

          <p>A construct has the following features.</p>

          <ul>

          <li>d10 Hit Die.</li>

          <li>Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (fast progression).</li>

          <li>No good saving throws.</li>

          <li>Skill points equal to 2 + Int modifier (minimum 1) per Hit Die.
          However, most constructs are mindless and gain no skill points or
          feats. Constructs do not have any class skills, regardless of their
          <em>Intelligence</em> scores.</li>

          <li>Construct Size Bonus Hit Points Fine — Diminutive — Tiny — Small
          10 Medium 20 Large 30 Huge 40 Gargantuan 60 Colossal 80</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>Traits</h2>

          <p>A construct possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted
          in a creature’s entry).</p>

          <ul>

          <li>No Constitution score. Any DCs or other statistics that rely on a
          Constitution score treat a construct as having a score of 10 (no bonus
          or penalty).</li>

          <li>Low-light vision.</li>

          <li>Darkvision 60 feet.</li>

          <li>Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,
          morale effects, patterns, and phantasms).</li>

          <li>Immunity to disease, death effects, necromancy effects, paralysis,
          poison, sleep effects, and stunning.</li>

          <li>Cannot heal damage on its own, but often can be repaired via
          exposure to a certain kind of effect (see the creature’s description
          for details) or through the use of the <em>Craft Construct</em> feat.
          Constructs can also be healed through spells such as <em>make
          whole</em>. A construct with the fast healing special quality still
          benefits from that quality.</li>

          <li>Not subject to <em>ability damage</em>, <em>ability drain</em>,
          fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, or nonlethal damage.</li>

          <li>Immunity to any effect that requires a <em>Fortitude</em> save
          (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).</li>

          <li>Not at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed
          when reduced to 0 hit points or less.</li>

          <li>A construct cannot be raised or resurrected.</li>

          <li>A construct is hard to destroy, and gains bonus hit points based
          on size, as shown on the following table.</li>

          </ul>

          <ul>

          <li>Proficient with its natural weapons only, unless generally
          humanoid in form, in which case proficient with any weapon mentioned
          in its entry.</li>

          <li>Proficient with no armor.</li>

          <li>Constructs do not breathe, eat, or sleep.</li>

          </ul>

      value: >-
        <p>A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a spellcaster from his
        own blood. They are weak combatants but make effective spies,
        messengers, and scouts. A homunculus’s creator determines its precise
        features; some are more refined looking, but most creators don’t bother
        to improve the creature’s appearance beyond the minimum necessary for
        functioning.</p><p>Homunculi are little more than tools designed to
        carry out assigned tasks. They are extensions of their creators, sharing
        the same alignment and basic nature. A homunculus never willingly
        travels more than a mile from its master, though it can be removed
        forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to
        return to this range, as it cannot communicate with its master beyond
        this distance. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of
        damage to its master. If the creature’s master is slain, the homunculus
        goes insane—it loses its Intelligence score, all feats, and all skill
        ranks, and generally claims the immediate surroundings as its domain,
        mindlessly attacking any who intrude upon its lair.</p><p>On rare
        occasions, a homunculus freed from its servitude rises above its
        master’s original intent and becomes more than a half-insane construct
        guardian of a long-forgotten lair. In some cases, a homunculus might
        even come to see itself as the rightful heir to its master’s legacy, or
        even the reincarnated spirit of the master himself.</p>
