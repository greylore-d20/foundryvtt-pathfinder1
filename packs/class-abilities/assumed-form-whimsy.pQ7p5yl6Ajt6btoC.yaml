        <p>You make yourself--including clothing, armor, weapons, and
        equipmen--look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin,
        fat, or in between. You cannot change your creature type (although you
        can appear as another subtype). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent
        change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look
        like an entirely different person or gender.</p><p>The spell does not
        provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it
        alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you
        or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a
        +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the
        glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.</p>

      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.oj36nfak6jc2s5ky]{disguise self} with a
      caster level equal to your oracle level. At 7th level, you can instead

      level, this ability lasts until you dismiss it or use it again, allowing
      you to keep it active while you sleep.</p>
