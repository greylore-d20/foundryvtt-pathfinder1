      <p>This spell functions like <i>gaseous form</i>, except the target's
      vaporous body is dangerous to creatures that touch it. A creature can make
      a Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Intelligence modifier) on its turn to
      resist the vapors. When you cast this spell, you select one of the
      following options. <i>Stinking cloud</i>: The target's body nauseates
      creatures that fail their saving throws, as <i>stinking cloud</i>
      (Fortitude negates, see text). This form of the spell does not require a
      material component. <i>Poisonous cloud</i>: The target's body is deadly
      poison, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage to creatures that fail
      their saves (Fortitude halves). This form of the spell requires a material
      component.</p>
