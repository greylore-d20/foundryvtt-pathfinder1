  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can temporarily disrupt a spell by expending 1 point from
      her arcane reservoir and succeeding at a dispel check against the spell,
      as @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic}. This ability
      suppresses a spell effect for a number of rounds equal to the arcanistâ€™s
      Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If the spell affects multiple creatures,
      this ability only suppresses the spell for one creature. At the end of
      this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count
      against its total duration. This ability can be used on unwilling targets,
      but the arcanist must succeed at a melee touch attack, and the target may
      attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. This ability has no
      effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of
      permanent.</p>
