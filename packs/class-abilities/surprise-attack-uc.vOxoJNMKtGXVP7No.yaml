  description:
    value: >-
      <p>During the surprise round, a rogue with this ability always considers
      opponents flat-footed, even if they have already acted. A rogue with this
      ability adds 1/2 her rogue level to her sneak attack damage rolls made
      during the surprise round.</p>
