  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each
      image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as
      <i><i>mirror</i> image</i>, except as noted.  Each creature that can see
      the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it
      can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken
      condition  and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this
      spell (beyond the usual effects of <i><i>mirror</i> image</i>). In
      addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw
      destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its
      perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on
      the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally
      disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round
      and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock. Both
      additional effects are mind-affecting fear effects, and spell resistance
      applies against them.  If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page
      12), a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom
      damage.</p>
