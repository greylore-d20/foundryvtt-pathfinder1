  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are well acquainted with scrying sensors. You can roll twice and
      take the better result on saving throws against divination (scrying)
      spells and effects, on Perception checks to notice scrying sensors, and on
      caster level checks to overcome spell resistance when you use a scrying
      spell or effect. If you notice a magical sensor, you can attempt a Stealth
      check opposed by the casterâ€™s caster level check to avoid being detected
      by the sensor.</p>
