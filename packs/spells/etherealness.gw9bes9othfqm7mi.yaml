  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>ethereal jaunt,</i> except that you and
      other willing creatures joined by linked hands (along with their
      equipment) become ethereal. Besides yourself, you can bring one creature
      per three caster levels to the Ethereal Plane. Once ethereal, the subjects
      need not stay together. When the spell expires, all affected creatures on
      the Ethereal Plane return to material existence.</p>
