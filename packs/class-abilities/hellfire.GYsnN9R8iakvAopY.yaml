    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you can call down a column of hellfire. This
      10-foot-radius burst does 1d6 points of fire damage per sorcerer level.
      Those caught in the area of your blast receive a <em>Reflex</em> save for
      half damage. Good creatures that fail their saves are <em>shaken</em> for
      a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer level. The DC of this save is
      equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier.
      At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, you
      can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use this
      ability three times per day. This power has a range of 60 feet.</p>
