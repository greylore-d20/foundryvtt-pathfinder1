    value: >-
      <p>With a DC 5 <em>Perform</em> (wind instruments) check, you can use a
      whistle to signal the same sorts of situations as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.ajsytnyezkieqlhz]{signal horns}. A
      whistle's piercing report can be clearly heard (<em>Perception</em> DC 0)
      up to a quarter-mile away. For each quarter-mile beyond,
      <em>Perception</em> checks to hear a whistle take a -2
      penalty.</p><p>Silent whistles are only heard by animals and other
      creatures with keen hearing.</p>
