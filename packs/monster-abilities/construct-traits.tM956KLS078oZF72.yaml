      (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms), necromancy
      effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and any effect that requires a
      Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).

      exhaustion, fatigue, or nonlethal damage. Constructs are not at risk of
