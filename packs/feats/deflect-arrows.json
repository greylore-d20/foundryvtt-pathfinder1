      "value": "<em>You can knock arrows and other projectiles off course, preventing them from hitting you.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can't be deflected.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>You can spend 5 stamina points to deflect an arrow while you're flat-footed. You must still be aware of the attack."
