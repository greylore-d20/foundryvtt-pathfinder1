      <p>This spell functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.h7ktzr7anfh382xu]{brand}, except that it inflicts
      1d6 points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily.
      In addition, a greater <em>brand</em> blazes as bright as a torch when
      brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol
      is blazing, the recipient is sickened.</p>

      <p>Like the effects of @Compendium[pf1.spells.lsboosfk26m0ycqv]{bestow
      curse}, a greater <em>brand</em> cannot be dispelled, but it can be
      removed by any means that removes a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.3jaumkutti1ytulq]{mark of justice}.</p>
