      <p>As a standard action, you can unleash a blast of freezing cold. This
      blast deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two wizard
      levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and staggers them
      for 1 round. A successful Reflex save negates the staggered effect and
      halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard
      level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of
      times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
