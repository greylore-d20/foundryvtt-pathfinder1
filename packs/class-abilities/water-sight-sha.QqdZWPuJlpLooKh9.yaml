  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman sees through fog and mist without penalty as long as there
      is enough light to otherwise allow her to see normally. At 7th level, she
      can use @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.g66w32kdup1f43bp]{scrying}, using any
      calm pool of water thatâ€™s at least 1 foot in diameter as the sole focus.
      At 15th level, this functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.glt6uk3n6g6l2p6l]{greater scrying}. She can
      use these abilities for a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman
      level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
