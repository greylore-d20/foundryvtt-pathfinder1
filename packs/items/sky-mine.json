To transform the balloons into decoys, dwarven siege warriors place dummies in cargo baskets beneath the balloons to look like balloonist scouts or snipers. Whoever releases the balloon can attempt a DC 15 <em>Profession</em> (driver), <em>Knowledge</em> (nature), or <em>Wisdom</em> check; if the check is successful, the balloon can be guided out to a maximum range of 300 feet, a far enough distance for archers to safely shoot the balloon with flaming arrows, causing it to explode in a devastating ball of fire. A detonated sky mine creates a 50-foot-radius burst of flame that deals 10d6 points of fire damage to anything in the area.</p>\r\n"
