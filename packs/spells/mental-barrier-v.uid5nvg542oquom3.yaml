  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This functions as <i>mental barrier III</i>, but if you are struck by a
      critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the additional
      damage is negated (as <i>moderate fortification</i>). This does not stack
      with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit
      or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to <i>mind thrust I</i>,
      <i>II</i>, and <i>III</i>, and you take half damage from <i>mind thrust
      IV</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>VI</i> (reduced to one-quarter on a successful
      Will save). This spell can be undercast.</p>
