  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The character is an expert at appearing to be an unimportant servant,
      be it an attacheÃÅ, bodyguard, driver, maid, kitchen assistant, or similar
      staff member. The character gains a +2 bonus on Disguise checks to appear
      to be a servant, but not to impersonate a particular servant. She also
      gains a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to lie to maintain this guise. While
      disguised as a servant, she gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather
      information among servants. Because she is easily overlooked as a servant,
      she can gather information from those she serves without asking them
      questions directly or alerting them to her interest. Doing so takes 1d4
      days and requires a successful Bluff check instead of a Diplomacy check.
      At 8th level, the bonuses granted by this talent increase to +4.</p>
