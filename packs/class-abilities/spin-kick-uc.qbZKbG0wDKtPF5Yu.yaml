      <p>The monk spins about, delivering a kick his foe did not expect. The
      monk makes his attack against the foe’s flat-footed AC. Creatures with the
      uncanny dodge class feature or a similar effect cannot be caught
      flat-footed by this style strike.</p>

      <p>The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.</p>
