      <p>DESCRIPTION</p>

      <p>This alchemical salve strengthens the material of a weapon, improves
      its balance, gives it greater flexibility without sacrificing resilience,
      and enhances its ability to hold an edge or point and survive an impact.
      An application turns a typical non-magical melee weapon into a masterwork
      weapon. A double weapon requires 2 doses of exemplar weapon salve, and 50
      arrows, bolts, or similar ammunition can be enhanced by a single
      application.</p>
