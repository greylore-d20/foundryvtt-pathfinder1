  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Like the great dragons, you can take to the skies and terrorize
      opponents from above. As a swift action, you can manifest leathery dragon
      wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (clumsy
      maneuverability).</p><p>At 10th level, your maneuverability increases to
      poor. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day for each oracle level
      you have. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be
      spent in 1-minute increments.</p><p>At 11th level you can use these wings
      for 10 minutes per day for each oracle level you have.</p><p>At 15th
      level, you can use the wings indefinitely.</p><p>You must be at least 7th
      level to select this revelation.</p>
