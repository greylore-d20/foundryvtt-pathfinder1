      <p>You cause the target to perceive the world as if in a dream. When the
      spell ends, the target forgets all identifying details of events that
      transpired while the spell lasted. The memories were not taken from it;
      rather, its mind never recorded the memories as real in the first place.
      If <i>modify memory</i> is cast upon it before the spell ends, the target
      remembers these events. A target under the effect of <i>lullaby</i> before
      this spell is cast applies its penalty to the saving throw against this
      spell.</p>
