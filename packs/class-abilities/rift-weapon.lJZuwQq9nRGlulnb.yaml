  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your understanding of the powers that move through the Outer Rifts
      allows you to imbue weapons with the ability to penetrate the defenses of
      creatures native to other planes. Once per day as a standard action, you
      can touch one weapon (or a group of up to 20 similar pieces of ammunition)
      and give it the ability to penetrate DR/cold iron for 1 minute per caster
      level.</p>

      <p>At 9th level, you can also grant the additional ability to bypass
      either DR/good and DR/law.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability an additional time per day for every 5 oracle
      levels you possess.</p>
