  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When cast on a container such as a quiver or a pouch that contains
      nonmagical ammunition or shuriken (including masterwork ammunition or
      shuriken, but not special materials, alchemical attributes, or nonmagical
      treatments on the ammunition), at the start of each round this spell
      replaces any ammunition taken from the container the round before. The
      ammunition taken from the container the round before vanishes. If, after
      casting this spell, you cast a spell that enhances projectiles, such as
      <i>align weapon</i> or <i>greater magic weapon</i>, on the same container,
      all projectiles this spell conjures are affected by that spell.</p>
