      blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an orc double axe is a
      double weapon. Though invented by and traditionally associated with orcs,
      the double axe can be crafted and wielded by other races as well, though
      many disdain it for its extreme weight and clumsiness. Because of the
      blades at either end of the axe, the wielder must hold an orc double axe
      in the middle of its haft, and utilize a weaving, slashing fighting style
      more akin to that of a quarterstaff than to that of a greataxe or
      battleaxe.</p>
