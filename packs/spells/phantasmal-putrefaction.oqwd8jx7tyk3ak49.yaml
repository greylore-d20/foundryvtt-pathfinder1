      <p>You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that their
      skin is rotting away, large rents are appearing all over their bodies, and
      their internal organs are spilling out into a putrid half-liquid mass at
      their feet. Those who fail to disbelieve <i>phantasmal putrefaction</i>
      immediately take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. This damage occurs only
      once. Each round at the beginning of its turn, an affected target receives
      another Will save to disbelieve the effect, and targets that fail must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or faint, falling a<i>sleep</i> as per
      <i>sleep</i> (except that it isn't a magical <i>sleep</i> effect). Waking
      up doesn't end the spell for a target; it must continue to attempt Will
      saves to disbelieve and Fortitude saves to avoid fainting each round until
      the spell ends or the target successfully disbelieves.  Targets of the
      spell perceive everyone else around them to be rotting away, but other
      creatures see no visible effect of the spell, so they, in addition to
      those who disbelieve, can communicate the nature of the illusion to
      allies, providing those allies with a +4 bonus on the saving throw to
      disbelieve.  If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a
      creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.</p>
