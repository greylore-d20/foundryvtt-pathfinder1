    value: >-
      <p>A wavering red ray projects from your finger. You must succeed on a
      ranged touch attack with the ray to hit your target.</p><p>The ray
      inflicts 1d4 points of nonlethal damage, causing the target to suffer from
      heatstroke as its body temperature dramatically increases. Except as noted
      above, this spell otherwise functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.vlzave855irdc7yu]{ray of
      exhaustion}.</p><p>Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort
      take a â€“4 penalty on their saves.</p>
