  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This glue is stored as two flasks of syrupy liquid. When mixed together
      and allowed to cure, they form a strong bond. The glue is sufficient to
      coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste, spills, and
      inaccurate mixing) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square
      inches each. The glue is tacky after 1 minute and fully cured after 1
      hour. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot)
      requires a DC 20 <em>Strength</em> check for tacky glue or DC 25 for cured
      glue. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square
      foot) is a DC 15 <em>Strength</em> check for tacky glue or DC 20 for cured
      glue.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC
