  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target weapon becomes a reservoir of spiritual energy, fueling its
      destructive power by drawing in a tiny fragment of the essence of each
      creature it is used to defeat. When the targeted weapon is used to reduce
      a living creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it gains a +1 profane bonus on
      damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for each creature reduced to 0 hit
      points or fewer with that weapon, up to a maximum bonus equal to 1/2 your
      caster level.</p>
