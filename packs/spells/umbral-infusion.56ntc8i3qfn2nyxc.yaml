    value: >-
      <p>You infuse the target mindless undead creature with power drawn from
      the Shadow Plane, immediately granting it the advanced creature simple
      template. It gains a +2 bonus on all rolls, including damage rolls, a +2
      bonus to special ability DCs, a +4 bonus to AC and CMD, and 2 additional
      hit points per Hit Die. The undead creature's destructive instincts take
      hold for the duration of this spell, and any attempts to control or
      command the undead creature have a 50% chance of failing; if uncontrolled,
      the undead creature attacks any living creatures it sees. This spell has
      no effect on undead creatures that already have the advanced creature
      template.</p>
