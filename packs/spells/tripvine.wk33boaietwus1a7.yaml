    value: >-
      <p>You animate a rope, vine, or similar object so that it attempts to trip
      any creature that comes near. The rope attacks anything in a
      10-foot-square area you designate. The rope does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity. Its CMB is equal to your caster level +2. A tripped target
      that was running, jumping, or charging takes 1d6 points of nonlethal
      damage. Creatures aware of the tripvine gain a +4 bonus to their CMD
      against it.</p><p>The Green Faith created this spell, but it is now
      common.</p>
