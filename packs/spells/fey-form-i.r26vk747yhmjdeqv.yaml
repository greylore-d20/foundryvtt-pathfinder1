  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You assume the form of a Small or Medium creature of the fey type. Your
    base speed changes to match the new form's base speed, with a maximum speed
    of 60 feet (even if the chosen fey form has a base speed in excess of that
    speed). If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain
    those abilities: climb speed 30 feet, fly speed 30 feet (average
    maneuverability), swim speed 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision,
    scent, and boot stomp. If the form you assume has the aquatic subtype, you
    can breathe air and water. If the creature has any weaknesses, you gain
    those weaknesses. If a listed ability depends on an item (as is the case
    with boot stomp), this spell transforms the nearest counterpart among your
    worn gear into that item.</p><p>You can more easily cast spells that the
    creature has as spell-like abilities, although you must still cast them as
    normal for your class. When you cast a spell that the creature has as a
    spell-like ability, it requires no verbal or somatic components and can't be
    countered.</p><p>Small Fey: If you assume this form, you gain a +2 size
    bonus to your Dexterity and Constitution scores.</p><p>Medium Fey: If you
    assume this form, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength and Constitution
    scores.</p>
