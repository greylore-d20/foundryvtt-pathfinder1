  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the arcanist targets one or more allies (excluding herself)
      with a spell, she can expend 1 arcane point from her arcane reservoir in
      order to grant those allies a number of temporary hit points equal to the
      spell’s level. These temporary hit points stack with temporary hit points
      from other sources, but temporary hit points from multiple uses of this
      exploit don’t stack with each other. The temporary hit points last 1
      minute per caster level or until expended.</p>
