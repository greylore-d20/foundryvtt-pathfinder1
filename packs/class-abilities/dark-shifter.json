      "value": "<p>The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a move action to change the target of an ongoing spell effect with the darkness descriptor. The new target must be within the spell’s original range, and uses the magus’s level as the effective caster level for the purpose of determining the maximum distance the effect can be moved from the magus. If the spell effect the magus is moving originated from another creature, the magus must succeed at a caster level check to reposition the effect (DC = 11 + the effect’s caster level). Failure wastes the magus’s move action, but doesn’t expend the point from his arcane pool.</p>\n<p>The magus must be at least 6th level before selecting this arcana.</p>"
