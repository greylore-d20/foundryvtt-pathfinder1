  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns
    those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it
    can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space
    with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire
    damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that
    damage. A <i>flaming sphere</i> rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall.
    It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as
    a torch would.</p><p>The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a
    move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can
    be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size.
    The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not
    cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures
    or batter down large obstacles. A <i>flaming sphere</i> winks out if it
    exceeds the spell's range.</p>
