  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon functions identically to a repeating heavy crossbow, except
      that its damage, critical, and range values are equivalent to those of a
      light crossbow instead of a heavy crossbow. Its significantly lighter
      construction and pull make it both more portable and more useful to those
      who rely on stealth or speed.</p>
