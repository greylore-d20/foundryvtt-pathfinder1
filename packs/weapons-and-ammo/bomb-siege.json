A bomb either explodes on impact (if fired from a catapult or trebuchet, or within 3 rounds of a fuse being lit if carried).</p>\n<p>When it explodes, it deals <strong>6d6 points of piercing and bludgeoning</strong> damage to all creatures and objects within <strong>30 feet</strong> of the target square.</p>\n<h3>Mishap</h3>\n<p>On a siege engine mishap, this ammunition explodes before it is launched, dealing its damage to the siege engine and all nearby creatures and wooden objects as if one of the spaces of the siege engine (crew leader's choice) were the target square. It ignores the hardness of wood and stone.</p>"
