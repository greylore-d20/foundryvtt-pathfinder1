    value: >-
      <p>You temporarily alter the target's memory (similar to <i>modify</i>
      memory) to eliminate, change, or implant a memory of up to 1 hour in
      length. When the duration of this expires, the target's real memory
      returns, and the false memory fades to little more than a vague outline,
      like a dream. This false memory seems true to the target, so effects that
      detect lies or force the target to speak the truth (as the subject
      understands it) don't detect the falsehood.</p>
