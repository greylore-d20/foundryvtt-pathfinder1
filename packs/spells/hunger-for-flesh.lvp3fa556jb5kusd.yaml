    value: >-
      <p>Your target's belly distends and its front teeth grow longer and
      sharper. The creature ravenously craves the flesh of its own kind, gaining
      the staggered condition as hunger pangs rack its altered body. The target
      gains a bite attack as a primary natural attack that deals damage
      appropriate for its size (1d6 if Medium, 1d4 if Small). There's a 25%
      chance on each of the creature's turns that it can't overcome its hunger.
      If so, it must move directly toward the nearest corporeal creature of its
      type and subtype (if applicable) and make a bite attack against it. If the
      target lacks enough actions to attack on that turn, it moves as close to
      the creature as it can, but on its next turn, if the percentile dice
      indicate it overcomes its hunger, the target is not forced to pursue or
      attack further.  On any round after the target deals damage to another
      creature of its own type and subtype (if applicable) with its bite attack,
      the target loses the staggered condition. If it doesn't continue dealing
      bite damage to applicable creatures, the target regains the staggered
      condition at the beginning of its next turn.</p>
