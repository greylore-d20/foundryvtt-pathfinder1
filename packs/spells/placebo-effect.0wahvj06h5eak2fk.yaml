  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The subject temporarily ceases to feel the ill effects of a single
      ongoing affliction or condition from the following list: blinded, cursed,
      dazed, deafened, diseased, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked,
      paralyzed, poisoned, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned. If that
      affliction or condition has a duration, it is suspended until this spell
      expires. If the subject has multiple instances of the same type of
      affliction (such as multiple diseases), a single casting of this spell can
      suspend only one of them. <i>Placebo effect</i> doesn't remove or
      temporarily negate any damage that the affliction may have already caused,
      nor does it provide protection against receiving such conditions
      again.</p>
