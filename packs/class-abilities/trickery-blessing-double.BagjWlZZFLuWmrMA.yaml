  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, as a move action you can create an illusory double of
      yourself. This double functions as a single
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.4jsss37x0pplib8f]{Mirror Image}, and lasts for a
      number of rounds equal to your warpriest level, or until the illusory
      duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. You can have no more than one double
      at a time.</p>

      <p>The double created by this ability doesnâ€™t stack with the additional
      images from the @Compendium[pf1.spells.4jsss37x0pplib8f]{Mirror Image}
      spell.</p>
