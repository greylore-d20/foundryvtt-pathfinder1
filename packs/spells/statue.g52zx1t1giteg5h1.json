The subject retains its own hit points.</p><p>The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body.</p><p>Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the <i>statue</i>'s arms constitutes serious damage. The subject of a <i>statue</i> spell can return to its normal state, act, and then return instantly to the <i>statue</i> state (a free action) if it so desires as long as the spell duration is in effect.</p>"
