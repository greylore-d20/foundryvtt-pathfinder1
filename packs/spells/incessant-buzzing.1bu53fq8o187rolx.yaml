  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You summon an illusory swarm of angry wasps that fills a 10-foot-diameter
    sphere. You can summon it so that it shares an area with other creatures,
    and you can move it up to 40 feet each round as a move action. Creatures
    caught inside the swarm's area of effect cannot use skills that require
    patience or concentration. Additionally, spellcasters within the area must
    succeed at a caster level check (DC =  20 + level of spell to be cast) in
    order to cast spells. On a failed caster level check, the spell is lost.
    While the buzzing is unpleasant, it is not so loud as to drown out other
    noises or make communication difficult.</p>
