  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You alter the flow of water in a natural freshwater channel such as a
      river, stream, or waterfall. The first version of this spell alters the
      speed of a river's flow. The second diverts the course of the targeted
      river.</p><p><i>Alter Current</i>: The river's current increases or
      decreases in speed by up to 1 mile per hour per 2 caster levels you
      possess. A typical placid river travels at a rate of up to 2 mph (no
      effect on local movement); a swift river travels 2-4 mph, moving creatures
      and objects 10 to 40 feet downstream per round; and an area of river
      rapids travels 7-10 mph, moving creatures and objects 60 to 90 feet
      downstream per round. Altering the speed of the current alters the
      difficulty of swimming in the water accordingly.</p><p><i>Divert
      River</i>: The river diverts its course in a direction of your choosing.
      The river flows in the general direction indicated, but otherwise conforms
      to the shape of the local terrain. This spell cannot cause a river to flow
      uphill, though the river surges over its natural banks and inundates
      terrain lower than its average depth. Creatures in the path of the
      redirected river are in danger of being swept away; if directed properly,
      this spell causes a flood. See Aquatic Terrain on page 432 of the <i>Core
      Rulebook</i> for more details.</p><p><i>Alter river</i> can be made
      permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p><p>Clever application of
      spells such as <i>move earth</i> can be combined with this spell to
      likewise make the river's new course permanent.</p>
