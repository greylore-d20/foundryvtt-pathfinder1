      <p>All recurring afflictions (those with a frequency,including curses,
      diseases, and poison) possessed by the targeted creature immediately
      trigger, requiring an immediate saving throw (as described in the
      affliction) to avoid suffering their effects. A successful saving throw
      does not count toward ending the affliction, and this extra save does not
      change the timing of the next save against the affliction. Afflictions
      without a frequency are unaffected by this spell.</p>
