  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian gains a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack
      that deals 1d4 points of damage (if the barbarian is Medium; 1d3 if the
      barbarian is Small) plus the barbarian’s Strength modifier. If made as
      part of a fullattack action with manufactured weapons, the bite attack is
      made at the barbarian’s full base attack bonus – 5, and she adds only 1/2
      her Strength modifier to the damage roll. The barbarian can make a bite
      attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. If
      the bite attack hits, grapple checks attempted by the barbarian against
      the target until the end of the round gain a +2 bonus.</p>
