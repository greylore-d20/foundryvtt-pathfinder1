    value: >-
      <p>You grab a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby
      opponents or objects. You must target a specific creature when casting
      this spell and once you select that creature you cannot switch to another.
      Each round, as a standard action, you can attempt to hurl the target at
      any creature or object within 30 feet of it. You must make an attack roll
      whenever you use the target as a weapon. The attack bonus for this attack
      is equal to your caster level plus either your Intelligence or Charisma
      modifier (whichever is higher). If you successfully hit the new target
      with the creature both it and the creature take damage based on the
      creature's size.</p> <table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>Creature

      The target creature can make a Fortitude saving throw each time you
      attempt to use it as a weapon. If it makes its saving throw it can act
      normally, but if it fails its save it loses all actions for the round and
      ends its turn prone in a square adjacent to the target of your attack.
      However, if the creature chooses to resist your efforts to move it, taking
      no other actions for the round, it gets a +4 circumstance bonus on its
      saving throw. The spell ends immediately if the target creature dies or is
      destroyed.<p></p>
