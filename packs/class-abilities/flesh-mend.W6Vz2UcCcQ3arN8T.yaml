  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to heal a
      living creature with a touch. The creature is healed an amount of damage
      equal to 1d8 + your occultist level.</p>

      <p>For every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 3rd, the creature is
      healed an additional 1d8 points of damage, to a maximum of 5d8+19 at 19th
      level. This has no effect on undead creatures.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>
