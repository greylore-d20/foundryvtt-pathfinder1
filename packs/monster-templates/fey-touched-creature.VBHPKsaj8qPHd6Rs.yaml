      <p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong> Inherited<br
      /><strong>Simple Template</strong> No<br /><strong>Usable with
      Summons</strong> Yes - Spellcasters with ties to the fey (such as
      sorcerers with the fey bloodline) can summon fey-touched creatures with
      summon monster spells</p><p>Fey-touched creatures are descended from
      inhabitants of the First World and often possess striking features
      compared to their normal counterparts, such as bright coloration or a
      cunning visage. The fey-touched creature's First World ancestor needn't be
      a fey specifically, and even magical beasts, First World gnomes, and other
      non-fey inhabitants of the fecund, magical plane can produce fey-touched
      heirs generations after their initial dalliance with residents of other
      planes. Some fey-touched creatures thus claim to be descended from the
      legendary Tane and even the godlike Eldest, though these claims are likely
      unfounded — such claims themselves intentional or accidental
      manifestations of the creature's hereditary First World influence.</p><p>A
      fey-touched creature's CR increases by 1 only if the base creature has 5
      or more Hit Dice. The fey-touched creature template can be applied only to
      living creatures. A fey-touched creature's quick and rebuild rules are the
      same. Spellcasters with ties to the fey (such as sorcerers with the fey
      bloodline) can summon fey-touched creatures with summon monster spells and
      take fey-touched creatures as improved familiars at 3rd level, similar to
      selecting celestial or infernal familiars.</p><p><strong>Rebuild

      Abilities</strong> gains +2 bonus on Will saves and DR as noted on the
      table; SR gains SR equal to new CR +5;</p><p><strong>Special
