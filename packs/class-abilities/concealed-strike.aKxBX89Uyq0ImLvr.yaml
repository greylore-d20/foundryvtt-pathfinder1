    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the vigilante attacks an opponent with a concealed weapon that
      his target wasnâ€™t aware of, he can attempt a Bluff check to feint that
      opponent as a move action.</p>

      <p>If he has the @Compendium[pf1.feats.tocde3sKG1O3GKgd]{Improved Feint}
      feat, he attempts this check as a free action instead.</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</p>
