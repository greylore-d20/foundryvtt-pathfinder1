      <p>You create a powerful bond between yourself and a single creature.
      Until the end of the spell's duration, each time the target is hit with an
      attack or fails a saving throw, you can take the full damage of that
      attack and any other effects that creature suffers. If you choose not to
      take on the damage and effects, you instead take a number of points of
      damage equal to your Constitution score as backlash. Any resistances or
      immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise reduce
      or negate the damage or effects of either the transfer or the backlash. If
      you or the subject of the spell move out of line of sight, the spell
      ends.</p>
