  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Bayonets are close combat weapons designed to fit into the grooves or
      muzzles of crossbows and firearms. They allow you to make melee attacks
      with these weapons but render them temporarily useless as ranged weapons.
      Attaching or removing a bayonet is a move action.</p>
