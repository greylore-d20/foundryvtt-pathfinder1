    value: >-
      <p>You give a creature the ability to use one of its natural attacks to
      firmly attach itself to an opponent. Choose one of the creature's natural
      attacks (usually a claw or bite attack).</p><p>The creature gains the grab
      ability with that natural attack, including the +4 bonus on combat
      maneuver checks to start or maintain a grapple. A creature with multiple
      natural attacks can strike at its grappled opponent with its other natural
      attacks, but cannot attack any other creature.</p>
