Pulling the cord (a move action) sparks a flint and steel within the device, causing the grenade to explode. The pull cord can be attached to a door or drawer within 5 feet, or strung across a 5-foot square, causing the grenade to detonate when its tripwire is disturbed. A pull-cord grenade cannot be reused.<p>This can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check.</p>\n<h2>Pull-Cord Grenade</h2>\n<p>Type mechanical; Perception DC 15; Disable Device DC 15</p>\n<h3>Effects</h3>\n<p>Trigger touch; Reset none<br>Effect explosion (2d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 fire damage); Reflex DC 15 half; multiple targets (all targets within 10 feet)</p>"
