  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You enhance your natural ability to seem small and unimportant, causing
    those around you to overlook you. You gain a +20 bonus on Stealth checks,
    which doesn't stack with  bonuses from effects that actually make you
    sneakier, such as <i>invisibility</i> or <i>respectful quiet</i> (see
    below); you do not need cover or concealment to hide; and you can hide while
    you are being observed. If a creature fails to notice you because of this
    spell, that creature can still remember seeing a halfling pass by, but
    attach no importance to the memory. You do not gain these benefits against
    creatures that are immune to compulsions or mind-affecting effects, and
    spell resistance applies. If you take an actively aggressive or extremely
    conspicuous action, creatures automatically notice you, and you gain no
    further benefits against those creatures for the remainder of the spell's
    duration.</p>
