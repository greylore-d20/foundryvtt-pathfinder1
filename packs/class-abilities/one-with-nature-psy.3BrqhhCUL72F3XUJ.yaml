      <p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate Wilderness pg. 93</p><p>You can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.65i0wc0e6fq0evk5]{detect animals or plants} as
      a spell-like ability at will. You gain a +2 insight bonus on Knowledge
      (nature) checks, and while using detect animals or plants, the bonus
      increases to +4 to identify a matching animal or plant creature within the
      area of effect. At 7th level, you can speak with any animal you
      successfully identify, as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.ct9fhh8uawn8e4md]{speak with animals}, but
      this ability doesnâ€™t make the creature any friendlier than normal.</p>
