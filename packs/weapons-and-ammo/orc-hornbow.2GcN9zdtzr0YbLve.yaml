      Groups</b> Bows</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Larger even than a longbow,
      these bows are often made from the horns of great beasts. Though they have
      a shorter range than other bows, their greater destructive power is highly
      favored by orcs and their kin. All hornbows are composite bows and can be
      modified to benefit from high Strength scores in the same way as other
      composite bows. Any effect that applies to both longbows and shortbows
      also applies to hornbows.</p>
