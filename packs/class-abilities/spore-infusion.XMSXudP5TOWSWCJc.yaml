      <p>Creatures that take piercing or slashing damage from your blast are
      infected with spores. If a target fails its Fortitude save, it takes 1d6
      points of damage per round for 10 rounds as plants and fungi grow out of
      its body. At the end of that time, the target is exposed to the pulsing
      puffs disease. This infusion is a disease effect. When using a wood
      kinetic blast against a creature infected by this infusion, you gain a +2
      bonus on attack rolls, to saving throw DCs, and on caster level checks to
      overcome spell resistance.<p><b>Pulsing Puffs:</b> Blastâ€”injury; <em>save
