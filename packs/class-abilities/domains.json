      "value": "<p>A clericâ€™s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two&nbsp;<em>domains</em>&nbsp;from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment&nbsp;<em>domain</em>&nbsp;(Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that&nbsp;<em>domain</em>. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two&nbsp;<em>domains</em>&nbsp;to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities (subject to GM approval). The restriction on alignment&nbsp;<em>domains</em>&nbsp;still applies.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<em>domain</em>&nbsp;grants a number of&nbsp;<em>domain</em>&nbsp;powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one&nbsp;<em>domain</em>&nbsp;spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two&nbsp;<em>domain</em>s in that slot. If a&nbsp;<em>domain</em>&nbsp;spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her&nbsp;<em>domain</em>&nbsp;spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.</p>\n<p>In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, activating a domain power is a standard action.</p>"
