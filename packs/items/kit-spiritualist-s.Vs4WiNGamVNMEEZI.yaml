            <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot
            radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional
            20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light
            becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in
            normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it
            as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
            equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire
            damage.</p>

            phantoms and similar creatures. You can throw a flask of ectoplasmic
            residue as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch
            attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals no
            damage, but the target must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be
            shaken for 1d4 rounds. Every creature within 5 feet of the point
            where the flask hits must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken
            for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear
