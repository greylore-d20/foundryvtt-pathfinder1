  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A small, elliptical metal case containing a small portrait or keepsake,
      a hypnotist’s locket can be attached to a belt or worn as a pendant. When
      hanging from a metal chain, a hypnotist’s locket grants a +2 circumstance
      bonus on Diplomacy checks for the hypnotism occult skill unlock.</p><p>A
      hypnotist’s locket can also come in the form of a pocket watch. It can be
      worn the same way, still includes a space for a portrait or keepsake, and
      adds the same bonus for hypnotism, but it also functions as a
      timepiece.</p>
