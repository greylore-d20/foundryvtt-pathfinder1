      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide pg. 142</p><p>You gain
      a +2 enhancement bonus to your CMD to resist bull rush, reposition, trip,
      and overrun attempts as long as you are touching the ground. This bonus
      increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you
      gain a +1 insight bonus on melee attack and damage rolls whenever both you
      and your foe are touching the ground. At 20th level, earth and stone do
      not block the line of effect of your spells, although they do still block
      your line of sight.</p>
