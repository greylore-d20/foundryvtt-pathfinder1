  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These deadly but majestic fliers are the favored aerial cavalry of many
      kingdoms. While griffons can be trained, some good deities consider doing
      so akin to enacting slavery, insisting that a griffon must come to its
      rider on its own free will. The price listed is for a trained griffon;
      free will is bought with different currency (determined by the GM). More
      information on griffons can be found in the <em>Bestiary</em>.</p>
