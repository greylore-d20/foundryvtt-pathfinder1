      <p><b>Element</b> aether, void, water, wood; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp);
      <b>Level</b> 4; <b>Burn</b> 1<br><b>Prerequisite</b> kinetic healer or
      void healer<br><b>Saving Throw</b> none; <b>SR</b> yes</p>

      <p>You use kinetic healer or void healer (whichever you have, or either if
      you have both) to heal all creatures in a 30-foot radius around you.
      Healing burst heals half as much damage as normal, unless your healing
      amount is based on positive blast, in which case it heals the full amount.
      Unlike kinetic healer, you must accept the burn yourself. This counts as
      kinetic healer for the purpose of the kinetic chirurgeon archetype (the
      17th-level metahealer ability heals the kinetic chirurgeon twiceâ€”once for
      half and once for full).</p>
