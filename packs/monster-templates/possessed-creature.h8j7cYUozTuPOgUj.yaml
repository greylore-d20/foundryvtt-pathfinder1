      RPG Occult Adventures for when a creature is possessed and totally
      controlled by a specific spell, sometimes a creature is possessed by a
      vague entity (hereafter called a spirit) that acts as a second personality
      within the creatureâ€™s mind, sharing control and providing the creature
      some symbiotic benefits.<p><b>Quick Rules:</b> +2 on rolls based on Cha;
      +4 on Will saves; after failing a save against a mind-affecting effect,
      reroll the save, but the spirit takes control if the second save succeeds;
      always acts on the surprise round.<p><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> Defensive
      Abilities +4 on Will saves; after failing a save against a mind-affecting
      effect, reroll the save, but the spirit takes control if the second save
      succeeds; Special Qualities always acts on the surprise round; Ability
