  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolonâ€™s evolutions
      to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but up to 6
      evolution points can be taken. Unlike the aspect ability, the eidolon
      loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction
      thereof) diverted to the summoner.</p>
