      <p>You ward an object or an area with your personal rune or mark. You can
      choose for the writing to be visible or invisible, and it doesn't harm the
      material upon which it is placed. A <i>detect magic</i> spell causes an
      invisible mark to glow and be visible. If any creature other than you
      touches the warded object or area and fails a Fortitude save, its skin
      turns bright red for 1 hour per level. This coloring cannot be washed
      away, but it can be dispelled.</p><p><i>See invisibility</i>, <i>true
      seeing</i>, a <i>gem of seeing</i>, or a <i>robe of eyes</i> likewise
      allows the user to see an invisible mark. A <i>read magic</i> spell
      reveals the words, if any. The ward cannot be dispelled, but it can be
      removed by the caster or by an <i>erase</i> spell.</p>
