  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws made to resist
      spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities. This bonus
      increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained. While
      raging, the barbarian cannot be a willing target of any spell and must
      make saving throws to resist all spells, even those cast by allies.</p>
