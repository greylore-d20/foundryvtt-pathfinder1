      <p>You create one or more vibrant pillars of kaleidoscopic color that rise
      out from the ground. A creature attempting to move through one of the
      pillars must attempt a Will save. Failure means the creature can't move
      through the pillar and can't take any other actions for the duration of
      its turn that round, but it can attempt to pass through the pillar again
      in subsequent rounds (attempting another save against the effect). A
      creature need only succeed at one saving throw to move through all pillars
      created by this spell.  A creature standing within the area of a pillar is
      dazzled (no save), while a creature making a ranged attack that passes
      through one or more of the illusory pillars takes a 50% miss chance. A
      creature can make a melee attack against a target within a pillar at no
      penalty.</p>
