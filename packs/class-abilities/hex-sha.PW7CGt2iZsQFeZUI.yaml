  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant
      her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th,
      8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes.
      A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the
      hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot
      select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.<p>Using a hex is a
      standard action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity unless
      otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2
      the shaman’s level + the shaman’s Wisdom modifier.</p>
