  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Using a slashing motion with the spell's focus as part of the casting
      of <i>shadow invasion</i>, you cut open a rift to the Plane of Shadow that
      fills a 30-foot area with <i>shadow</i>y energies. This area is stationary
      and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as
      darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the
      <i>shadow</i> subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such
      as <i>shadow</i> evocation) have their reduced effects increased by 20%
      (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the
      area of <i>shadow invasion</i>.  In addition, the rift created by
      <i>shadow invasion</i> has a chance of attracting attention from the other
      side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When
      <i>shadow invasion</i> is dismissed as a standard action, there is a
      chance that a single evangelist kyton (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 185)
      will be summoned under the caster's command (as per <i>summon monster</i>
      V). This chance is 5% for every full round that <i>shadow invasion</i> was
      active. If the caster level of <i>shadow invasion</i> is 16th or greater,
      this effect summons an interlocutorB3 kyton instead. A kyton summoned this
      way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of
      <i>shadow invasion</i> would have been had it not been dismissed.
      Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as
      though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors.</p>
