  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The targets' physical forms undergo a bizarre transformation. They look
      and function normally, but are composed of countless particles that
      separate and reconnect to remain whole. Each target gains fast healing 1
      and is immune to bleed damage, critical hits, sneak attacks, and other
      forms of precision damage. The value of this fast healing increases by 1
      at caster levels 10th, 15th, and 20th. Any target can end the spell effect
      on itself as a swift action; the target then regains 5d6 hit points and
      can attempt an additional saving throw against any one disease or poison
      affecting it (at the original save DC), ending that disease or poison with
      a successful saving throw.</p>
