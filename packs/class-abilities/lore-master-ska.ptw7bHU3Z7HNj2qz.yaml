  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of
      lore, and can take 10 on any Knowledge check for which he has ranks. Once
      per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge check as a standard
      action, instead of spending the normal amount of time that taking 20
      requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge check twice
      per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level.</p>
