    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the cavalier may select a terrain type from the ranger
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.U2YBSx1s8cT8iDq1]{Favored
      Terrains} table. As a standard action, he can shout orders that grant all
      allies within 60 feet a competence bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on
      initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, and Survival
      checks while they are in this terrain for a number of rounds equal to 1/2
      his cavalier level. At 12th level and every four levels thereafter, the
      cavalier may select a new terrain type that this ability can affect.</p>
