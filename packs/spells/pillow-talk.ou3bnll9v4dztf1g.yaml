    value: >-
      <p>This spell can be cast only on a sleeping creature, which must be
      present for the full duration of the casting time. You grant the semblance
      of wakefulness to the target, allowing it to answer questions. You can ask
      one question per 2 caster levels. The target's knowledge is limited to
      what it normally knows, including the languages it speaks. Answers are
      brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have
      opposed you when awake. If the target succeeds at a Will save, it awakens
      (unless some force is  preventing it from being awake, such as magic or
      drugs), and it remains aware of the first question you asked. If the
      target has been subject to <i>pillow talk</i> within the past week, the
      new spell fails. While your questions don't otherwise wake the target,
      this spell does nothing to prevent other sounds or stimulus from waking
      the target. A target who sleeps through the spellcasting and duration of
      the spell has no memory of it taking place, but a target who awakens
      before the spell ends remembers every question asked and what answers it
      gave.</p>
