  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell conjures a miniature sphere of sunlight, approximately the
    size of a human fist, at a desired location within range. The sphere sheds
    bright light in a 60-foot-radius burst. Creatures that take penalties in
    bright light do so while within the sphere's area of illumination. Creatures
    that start their turns within the area of illumination and that are damaged
    or destroyed by sunlight must succeed at a Fortitude save or become
    staggered until 1d4+1 rounds after they leave the affected area.
    Non-creatures, such as hazardous fungi and mold that are destroyed by
    sunlight, become inert for the duration of the spell.  The sphere cannot be
    moved from the place it was cast. The sphere deals 10d6 points of fire
    damage to anything it touches and anything that passes within 5 feet of it.
    A successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half.</p>
