    value: >-
      <p>Whenever a spell you cast triggers a primal magic event (see page 13),
      or whenever you use a rod of wonder, roll d% twice when generating the
      result. You may pick which of the two results actually occurs. You gain a
      +2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist primal magic events or
      magical effects caused by a rod of wonder.</p>
