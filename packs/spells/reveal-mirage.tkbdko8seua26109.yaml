  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can focus upon a single point within line of sight and discern if
      the terrain or geographic features of that point are illusory. This
      ability allows you a Will save to disbelieve a terrain-affecting illusion
      (glamer) effect from range as though you had interacted with it. In
      addition to affecting such spells as <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> and
      <i>mirage arcana</i>, this spell also allows you to disbelieve naturally
      occurring mirages.</p>
