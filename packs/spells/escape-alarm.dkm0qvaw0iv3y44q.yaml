  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You place a ward on an area that notifies you when a creature exits
      it.</p><p>This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.nee6cxpoekp3aklq]{alarm}, except as
      noted. It alerts you when a creature leaves, rather than enters, the area,
      and you can't select a password to bypass its effects. Instead, when you
      place an escape <em>alarm</em>, you can attune up to one additional
      creature per caster level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to
      your own escape <em>alarm</em> and don't count against the limit. Attuned
      creatures can enter and exit the spell's area without triggering the
      <em>alarm</em>. If you select a mental <em>alarm</em> rather than an
      audible one, all attuned creatures receive the mental alert when someone
      exits the warded area.</p>
