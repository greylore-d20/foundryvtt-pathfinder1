      <p>A character who selects this talent gains
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.LUOETW7Fm0oPKKWj]{Improved Dirty Trick} as
      a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level,
      she is treated as if she meets all the prerequisites for
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.mY29nl8eCF5GjchB]{Greater Dirty Trick}
      (although she must take the feat as normal). If she succeeds in giving her
      target the blinded condition, the target cannot remove the condition
      during the first round of blindness.</p>
