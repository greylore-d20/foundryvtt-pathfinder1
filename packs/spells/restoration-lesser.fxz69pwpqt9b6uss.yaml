      <p><i>Lesser restoration</i> dispels any magical effects reducing one of
      the subject's ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability
      damage to one of the subject's ability scores. It also eliminates any
      fatigue suffered by the character, and improves an exhausted condition to
      fatigued. It does not restore permanent ability drain.</p>
