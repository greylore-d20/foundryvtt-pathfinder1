    value: >-
      <p>You must succeed on a melee touch attack. You place the subject into a
      state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow, and
      its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body
      functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. This state
      persists until the magic is removed (such as by a successful <i>dispel
      magic</i> spell or a <i>freedom</i> spell).</p>
