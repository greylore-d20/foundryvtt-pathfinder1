  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can pack the casing full of sand
      that explodes in an abrasive cloud on impact. A creature that takes a
      direct hit from a sand bomb is blinded for 1 round, as are any creatures
      in the splash radius that fail a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the
      alchemistâ€™s level + his Intelligence modifier).</p>
