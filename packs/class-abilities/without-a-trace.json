The rogue attempts a Stealth check with a –20 penalty, but gains a +1 bonus on her check for every die of damage the avoided attack would have dealt. The rogue can attempt this check even while being observed, as long as she has cover or concealment or an ability that allows her to use the Stealth skill while being observed without cover or concealment.</p>"
