      <p>This discovery is popular among necromancers and necrologists alike;
      aside from its offensive potential, necrologists sometimes use it to turn
      uncooperative live creatures they wish to question into pliable undead.
      The alchemistâ€™s bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, and
      creatures that take a direct hit from a boneshard bomb must succeed at a
      Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of bleed damage in addition to normal
      damage. If a creature is killed by a boneshard bomb or the resulting bleed
      effect, its corpse immediately reanimates as an undead creature with the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.monster-templates.Item.pnAOF0zWjd0rrYzC]{skeleton}
      template. Skeletons that are created in this manner count as undead
      created by @Compendium[pf1.spells.8uwmrygxgih1fb57]{Animate Dead} for the
      purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can
      control.</p><p>An alchemist must possess the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.6ANPEvygaIVogxOf]{alchemical
      zombie} discovery to select this discovery.</p><hr
