  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This leather knapsack has one large pocket that closes with a buckled
      strap and holds about 2 cubic feet of material. Some may have one or more
      smaller pockets on the sides.</p><p>Reinforced metal bars allow for this
      leather backpack to withstand a greater degree of stress than a
      traditional pack. Along with the standard backpack compartment, this pack
      has an additional pouch and harness at its top. Used together, the harness
      and pouch can safely contain a Tiny or smaller creature. While harnessed,
      the creature can't leave the backpack or see outside of it; it takes a
      full-round action to remove the harness from a carried creature.</p>
