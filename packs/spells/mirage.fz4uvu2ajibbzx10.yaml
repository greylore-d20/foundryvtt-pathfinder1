    value: >-
      <p>You create an image of a pool of water, a group of standing stones, a
      cove, an island, or another simple land formation over a stretch of flat
      land or water. The image is purely visual, and structures, equipment, and
      creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in
      appearance.</p><p>Anyone interacting with the illusion can attempt to
      disbelieve it, and a creature trained in Survival can make a special
      attempt to disbelieve the illusion. The creature must be within 120 feet
      of the illusion's area and can attempt a Survival check instead of a Will
      saving throw. If the result is equal to or greater than the spell's save
      DC, the creature realizes the mirage is an illusion as if it disbelieved
      the spell.</p>
