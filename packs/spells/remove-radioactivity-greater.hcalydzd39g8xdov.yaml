      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.b5apdmp3s5g78uxw]{remove radioactivity},
      save that it cures all ability damage and drain due to radioactivity that
      the target has taken. In addition, you can deplete a radioactive object as
      well, although because you must touch the object to affect it, you expose
      yourself to at least 1 round of contact with the object's radiation. You
      must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 5 + the Fortitude DC associated
      with the radiation effect) in order to deplete the object. If you are
      successful, the object no longer emits radiation. In the case of a nuclear
      reactor or atomic warhead, this permanently renders the reactor or warhead
      inert and harmless.</p>
