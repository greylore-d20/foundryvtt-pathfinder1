  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian gains resistance to one energy type (acid, cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1).
      At 8th level, she gains limited immunity to the same type of energy, as
      protection from energy. She can absorb 2 points of damage per level, and
      she applies her energy resistance first.</p>

      <p>The energy type is chosen when this rage power is selected, and it
      canâ€™t be changed.</p>

      <p>This rage power can be selected more than once; each time, it applies
      to a different energy type.</p>
