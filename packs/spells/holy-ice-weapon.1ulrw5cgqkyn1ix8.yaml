  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a masterwork weapon that has the qualities of ice and holy
    water. This weapon must be a simple weapon or your deity's favored weapon.
    The weapon deals normal damage for a weapon of that type, plus 1 point of
    cold damage per caster level (maximum 10). In addition, any creature struck
    by the weapon is also hit by holy water, dealing 1d4 points of damage if the
    creature is susceptible to holy water. If the weapon leaves your hands for
    more than 1 round, it melts and the spell ends.</p><p>At caster level 6th,
    the weapon gains the <i>returning</i> weapon special ability when thrown,
    melting away after an attack and re-forming in your hand just before your
    next turn.</p>
