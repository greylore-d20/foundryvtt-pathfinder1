      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 30 gp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>\r\n<p>This milky fluid can be mixed with water to quickly kill light and medium vegetation. One flask of defoliant kills light brush and small trees in 50 5-foot squares. Light vegetation (anything but trees) dies within 1 hour and can be cleared at a rate of 10 minutes per 5-foot square (representing uprooting dead plants and breaking stumps into gravel-sized pieces), leaving barren ground. Medium vegetation (anything but massive trees) dies in 2 hours and can be cleared at a rate of 1 hour per 5-foot square. Massive trees can usually survive a single dose of defoliant, and using defoliant doesn't make clearing them any easier. Defoliant can be used as a splash weapon against plant creatures. A direct hit with the undiluted fluid deals 1d6 hit points of damage, 1 point of <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a> damage, and 1 point of <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a> damage (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a> DC 20 negates the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a> and <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a> damage); plant creatures within 5 feet of the target take 1 hit point of damage.</p>\r\n"
