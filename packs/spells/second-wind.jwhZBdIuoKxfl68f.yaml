    value: >-
      <p>You can cast this spell only when you have fewer than one-quarter of
      your total hit points. With a gasping utterance, you summon invigorating
      air to fill your lungs. You heal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster
      level (maximum +10). You can cast this spell either as a swift action on
      your turn or as an immediate action when you are brought to below 0 hit
      points. If you do not breathe, you canâ€™t benefit from this spell.</p>
