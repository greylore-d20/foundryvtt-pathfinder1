  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a path of handholds on earthen, plaster, stone, or wooden
    walls (not on walls made of metal or other, harder materials). The handholds
    are created in pairs and are approximately 3 feet apart, located in a
    specific path indicated by your gestures while casting the spell. The
    handholds' path can span up to 30 feet out from you plus an additional 10
    feet per 3 caster levels (maximum 90 feet at 18th level). The handholds
    protrude approximately 6 inches from the wall, measure 10 inches lengthwise,
    and are perfectly suited for gripping with fingers or claws. At the end of
    the spell's duration, any creature being supported by the handholds
    immediately begins to fall.</p>
