      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Some skeletons retain their
      intelligence and cunning, making them formidable warriors. These undead
      are far more powerful than their mindless kin, and many gain class

      racial HD to d8s, then add 2 racial Hit Dice to this total (creatures
      without racial HD gain 2). HD from class levels are
      unchanged.<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A skeletal champion gains DR
      5/bludgeoning, channel resistance +4, and immunity to cold. It also gains
      all of the standard undead traits.<p><b>Speed:</b> As standard
      skeleton.<p><b>Attacks:</b> As standard skeleton.<p><b>Abilities:</b> Str
