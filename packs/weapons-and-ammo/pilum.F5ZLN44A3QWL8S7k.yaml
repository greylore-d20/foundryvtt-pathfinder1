      Groups</b> Spears; Thrown</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The tip of this heavy
      javelin is designed to break off and embed itself into a shield once it
      hits. Like ammunition, a thrown pilum that hits its target is destroyed.
      If you hit a shieldbearing opponent with a pilum, he loses the AC bonuses
      from that shield until he takes a standard action to pry the remnants of
      the pilum from his shield.</p>
