  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>teleport,</i> except that there is no range
    limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need
    not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a
    reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you
    attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading
    information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location.
    Interplanar travel is not possible.</p>
