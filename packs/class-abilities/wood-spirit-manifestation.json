      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a living creature of wood. She is forevermore treated as a plant creature rather than her original creature type for the purposes of spells and magical effects. Her skin takes on the appearance of polished wood grain, and she gains a +4 natural armor bonus to her Armor Class and damage reduction 10/— against wooden weapons and the natural attacks of wooden and wood-like creatures. She gains immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun.</p>\n<p>At will, the shaman can meld with any tree or single block of wood (as per&nbsp;meld into stone, except she can meld only with wood and has no limit on how long she can remain in the wood).</p>"
