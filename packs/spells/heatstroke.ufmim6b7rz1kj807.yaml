      <p>A wavering red ray projects from your finger. You must succeed on a
      ranged touch attack with the ray to hit your target.</p><p>The ray
      inflicts 1d4 points of nonlethal damage, causing the target to suffer from
      heatstroke as its body temperature dramatically increases. Except as noted
      above, this spell otherwise functions as <i>ray of
      exhaustion</i>.</p><p>Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any
