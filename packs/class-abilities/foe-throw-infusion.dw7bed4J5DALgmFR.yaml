      <p>Your telekinetic blast can throw a Large or smaller creature instead of
      an unattended object; you can increase the burn cost by 1 to affect a
      creature of a larger size. If the creature you attempt to throw succeeds
      at a Fortitude save, it negates the blast entirely. Otherwise, if your
      blast hits, both the thrown creature and the target take the full amount
      of damage from your telekinetic blast, and the thrown creature falls prone
      in the last unoccupied space along its path. If your blast misses, the
      thrown creature can choose to occupy any space within 30 feet of the
      target, it doesn’t fall prone, and it takes half the normal amount of
      damage from your blast. The movement doesn’t provoke attacks of
      opportunity.</p>
