      <p>This spell makes a weapon magically <i>keen</i>, improving its ability
      to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the
      weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20
      becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be
      cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow
      bolts, the <i>keen edge</i> on a particular projectile ends after one use,
      whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.</p><p>Treat
      shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this
      spell.</p><p>Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such
      as the <i>keen</i> special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat)
      don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a
      claw.</p>
