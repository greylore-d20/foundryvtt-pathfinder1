  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A scarf you are wearing frays at the end into hook-like shapes  and can
    extend to incredible lengths. Although your scarf retains its weight, its
    frayed ends function as a grappling hook that can be thrown with a range
    increment of 20 feet. Your scarf elongates to 100 feet the first time it is
    thrown during the spell duration. Regardless of its apparent material, the
    scarf is as strong and easy to climb as a knotted silk rope. At the end of
    the duration, the scarf detaches and returns to its former shape, fluttering
    down from its position if you haven't already retrieved it.</p>
