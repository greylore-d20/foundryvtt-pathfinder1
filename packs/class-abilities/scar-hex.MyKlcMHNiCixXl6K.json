      "value": "<p>This hex curses a single target touched with horrible scars of the witch's choosing, whether something as simple as a single letter on the target's forehead or blotchy, burnlike scars on his body. The target may make a Will save to resist this hex. These scars do not interfere with the target's senses or prevent it from using abilities, but may affect social interactions. They persist through disguises and shapechanging.</p><p>The witch can use her hexes on the scarred target at a range of up to 1 mile, and she is considered to have a body part from the target for the purpose of scrying and similar divination spells. The witch can withdraw this hex from a target as a move action at any range.</p><p>The number of supernatural scars the witch can maintain at once is equal to her Intelligence bonus ([[@abilities.int.mod]]); once she reaches this limit, she must remove the scar from a current victim in order to mark another. Effects that remove curses can remove the scar.</p>"
