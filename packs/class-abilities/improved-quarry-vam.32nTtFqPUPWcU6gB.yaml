  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 19th level, the vampire hunterâ€™s ability to hunt his <em>undead</em>
      quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a <em>free action</em>, and
      can now <em>take 20</em> while using <em>Survival</em> to track his quarry
      while moving at normal speed, without penalty. His <em>insight bonus</em>
      to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or
      dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
