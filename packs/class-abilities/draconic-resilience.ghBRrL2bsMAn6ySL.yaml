  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman grants a creature she touches some of the magically
      resilient nature of dragons, causing the creature to be immune to magical
      sleep effects for a number of rounds equal to the shamanâ€™s level.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, the creature is also immune to paralysis for this
      duration.</p>

      <p>Once a creature has benefited from the draconic resilience hex, it
      cannot benefit from this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
