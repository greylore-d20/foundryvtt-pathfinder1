      "value": "<p>As a full-round action, the rogue can move up to her speed. If she successfully reaches a location that offers her cover or concealment, any creature observing her must attempt a Perception check opposed by the rogueâ€™s Stealth check. On a failed check, the observer loses track of the rogue and fails to note where she moved to. The rogue does not take a penalty on this Stealth check for moving up to her speed. At the end of her movement, the rogue can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 60 feet who were aware of her at any point during her movement and are unaware of her current location. She rolls the Intimidate check only once and compares her result to the DC for each opponent. The rogue must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</p>"
