      charge/round</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A hologram generator is a handheld
      device with a long, thin barrel. It manipulates photons and sound waves to
      produce highly realistic images and sounds, similar in nature to those
      generated by figment illusions.</p><p>Before a hologram generator can
      generate an image, though, it must store the image in its memory. The
      maximum size and maximum number of images a generator can store vary
      according to its color, but storing an image is a standard action
      regardless of the strength of the generator. More powerful generators can
      store moving images and sounds, or even generate illusions that interact
      with their environments.</p><p>Once a hologram generator's memory is full,
      additional images overwrite existing images as chosen by the user at the
      time of their recording.</p><p>Generating a hologram is a standard action.
      If the hologram generator is then left alone, it continues to project the
      image until it depletes its charges. Alternatively, the user can aim the
      hologram at a different location as a move action.</p><p>A hologram
      generator is a color-coded item, and the particulars of its abilities,
      including its energy capacity, the range at which it can create its
      holograms, and the Will save DC to disbelieve the hologram if it is
      interacted with, vary as detailed below.</p><p><strong>White Hologram
      Generator</strong>: A white hologram generator can create a static,
      motionless image no larger than a Large creature, and can store five
      images.</p><p><strong>Gray Hologram Generator</strong>: A gray hologram
      generator functions as a white hologram generator (and can store up to
      seven images), but can also store up to 1 minute of moving imagery as
      well. A moving hologram can move anywhere in range of the generator (see
      table on next page), as long as the user continues to take a move action
      each round to aim and direct the motion. An unattended generator's
      hologram cannot leave its imagery, but it can be mobile in that
      area.</p><p><strong>Green Hologram Generator</strong>: A green hologram
      generator functions as a gray one, except that it can incorporate sound as
      well, with all appropriate sound coming from the image. It can store up to
      nine images or 2 minutes of moving imagery. It can store images equal in
      size to a Huge or smaller creature.</p><p><strong>Red Hologram
      Generator</strong>: A red hologram generator functions as a green one,
      except that it can create two images within range simultaneously.
      Directing these images is a free action. A red hologram generator can
      store up to 11 images or 3 minutes of moving
      imagery.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Color</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Capacity</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Range</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Will</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brown</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>100
