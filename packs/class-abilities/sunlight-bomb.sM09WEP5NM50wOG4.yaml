  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist can throw bombs that explode with a searing radiance
      equivalent to that of sunlight and that act as blinding bombs. Undead,
      fungi, molds, oozes, slimes, and creatures to which sunlight is harmful or
      unnatural take +2 damage per die from the bomb. Undead that are harmed by
      sunlight and that fail their saves against the bomb are staggered for 1
      round.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the blinding
      bomb discovery before he can select this discovery.</p>
