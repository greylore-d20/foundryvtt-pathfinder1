    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as per <i>produce flame</i>, except that the 
      flames never glow brighter than dim light, including any fires started by
      this spell. These flames cast light only half the distance of a torch and
      cannot be seen from more than 100 feet away. The flames deal 2d6 points of
      fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Against plants, this
      damage increases to 2d6 points + 2 points per caster level (maximum
      +10).</p>
