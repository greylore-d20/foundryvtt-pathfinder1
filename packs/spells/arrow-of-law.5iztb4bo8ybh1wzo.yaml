    value: >-
      <p>You fire a shimmering arrow of pure order from your holy symbol at any
      one target in range as a ranged touch attack.</p><p>A chaotic creature
      struck by an <i>arrow of law</i> takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster
      levels (maximum 5d8). A chaotic outsider instead takes 1d6 points of
      damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and is dazed for 1 round. A
      successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze
      effect.</p><p>This spell deals only half damage to creatures that are
      neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. The arrow has no
      effect on lawful creatures.</p>
