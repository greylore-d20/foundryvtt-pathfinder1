    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can blend into groups easily. Opposed
      Perception and Sense Motive checks take a –2 penalty when made against the
      character’s Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth checks if she’s
      within 30 feet of at least two non-hostile characters of her apparent
      creature type. This penalty increases to –4 if she’s within 30 feet of at
      least eight such creatures or is currently in a square occupied by a
      crowd.</p>
