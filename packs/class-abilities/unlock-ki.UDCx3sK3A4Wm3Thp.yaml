  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this advanced talent increases the number of points in
      the ki pool that she gains from the ki pool rogue talent to be equal to
      1/2 her rogue level + her highest mental ability score modifier
      (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). In addition, she can spend 2 points
      from her ki pool as a swift action to gain the skill unlocks (Pathfinder
      Unchained 82) for one skill of her choice as appropriate for her number of
      ranks in that skill. This benefit lasts for 1 minute. The rogue must have
      a ki pool before selecting this advanced talent.</p>
