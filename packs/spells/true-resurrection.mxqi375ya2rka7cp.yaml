    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>raise dead,</i> except that you can
      resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster
      level.</p><p>This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have
      been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in
      some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of birth or death is
      the most common method).</p><p>Upon completion of the spell, the creature
      is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no
      negative levels (or Constitution points) and all of the prepared spells
      possessed by the creature when it died.</p><p>You can revive someone
      killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead
      creature and then destroyed.</p><p>This spell can also resurrect
      elementals or outsiders, but it can't resurrect constructs or undead
      creatures.</p><p>Even <i>true resurrection</i> can't restore to life a
      creature who has died of old age.</p>
