          <p>Undead are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or
          supernatural forces.</p>

          <h2>Features</h2>

          <p>An undead creature has the following features.</p>

          <ul>

          <li>d8 Hit Die.</li>

          <li>Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (medium
          progression).</li>

          <li>Good <em>Will</em> Saves.</li>

          <li>Skill points equal to 4 + Int modifier (minimum 1) per Hit Die.
          Many undead, however, are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.
          The following are class skills for undead: <em>Climb</em>,
          <em>Disguise</em>, <em>Fly</em>, <em>Intimidate</em>,
          <em>Knowledge</em> (arcane), <em>Knowledge</em> (religion),
          <em>Perception</em>, <em>Sense Motive</em>, <em>Spellcraft</em>, and
          <em>Stealth</em>.</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>Traits</h2>

          <p>An undead creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
          noted in a creature’s entry).</p>

          <ul>

          <li>No Constitution score. Undead use their <em>Charisma</em> score in
          place of their Constitution score when calculating hit points,
          <em>Fortitude</em> saves, and any special ability that relies on
          Constitution (such as when calculating a breath weapon’s DC).</li>

          <li><em>Darkvision</em> 60 feet.</li>

          <li>Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,
          morale effects, patterns, and phantasms).</li>

          <li>Immunity to death effects, disease, paralysis, poison, sleep
          effects, and stunning.</li>

          <li>Not subject to nonlethal damage, <em>ability drain</em>, or energy
          drain. Immune to <em>damage</em> to its physical ability scores
          (Constitution, Dexterity, and <em>Strength</em>), as well as to
          exhaustion and fatigue effects.</li>

          <li>Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no <em>Intelligence</em>
          score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such as an inflict
          spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast healing special quality
          works regardless of the creature’s <em>Intelligence</em> score.</li>

          <li>Immunity to any effect that requires a <em>Fortitude</em> save
          (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).</li>

          <li>Not at risk of death from massive damage, but is immediately
          destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</li>

          <li>Not affected by <em>raise dead</em> and <em>reincarnate</em>
          spells or abilities. Resurrection and <em>true resurrection</em> can
          affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into
          the living creatures they were before becoming undead.</li>

          <li>Proficient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons, and any
          weapons mentioned in its entry.</li>

          <li>Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy)
          it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Undead not
          indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Undead are
          proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of
          armor.</li>

          <li>Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.</li>

          </ul>

        <p>Zombies are the animated corpses of dead creatures, forced into foul
        unlife via necromantic magic like animate dead. While the most commonly
        encountered zombies are slow and tough, others possess a variety of
        traits, allowing them to spread disease or move with increased
        speed.</p><p>Zombies are unthinking automatons, and can do little more
        than follow orders. When left unattended, zombies tend to mill about in
        search of living creatures to slaughter and devour. Zombies attack until
        destroyed, having no regard for their own safety.</p><p>Although capable
        of following orders, zombies are more often unleashed into an area with
        no command other than to kill living creatures. As a result, zombies are
        often encountered in packs, wandering around places the living frequent,
        looking for victims. Most zombies are created using animate dead. Such
        zombies are always of the standard type, unless the creator also casts
        haste or remove paralysis to create fast zombies, or contagion to create
        plague zombies.</p>
