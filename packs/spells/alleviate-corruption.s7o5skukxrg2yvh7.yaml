      <p>You combat the rising corruption (see page 14) in another creature or
      advance the long-term process of exorcising it entirely. This spell has
      two purposes, and you choose which application to use at the time of
      casting. <i>Combat Corruption</i>: Each time a creature fails a saving
      throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that 
      corruption's Progression section), it advances to the next corruption
      stage-at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this
      spell can lower the target's corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if
      the target isn't at progression stage of 1 or higher. <i>Remove
      Corruption</i>: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target
      creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its
      corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts
      and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of
      <i>alleviate corruption</i> doesn't reduce the target's corruption stage.
      If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the
      corruption.  Either application of the spell requires a caster level
      check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target's manifestation level + 3
      times the target's corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3
      removes the character from player control).  Tampering with corruptions is
      dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level
      check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation
      (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A
      roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If
      you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an
      immediate saving throw against it. Casting <i>alleviate corruption</i> on
      yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully
      succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it). A
      creature can be the beneficiary of this spell only once per week, whether
      it succeeds or not.</p>
