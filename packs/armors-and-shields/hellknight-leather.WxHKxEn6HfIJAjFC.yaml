  description:
    value: >-
      <p>There are instances where wearing full plate armor can jeopardize a
      Hellknight’s life. Primarily worn by Hellknight sailors, this studded
      leather armor includes heavy gloves and a helm of sculpted leather
      designed to look like a skull— either a human’s or that of some aquatic
      creature. Hellknight leather’s statistics are identical to those of
      studded leather, except it costs 5 gp more and weighs 5 pounds more.</p>
