      <p>For some heroes, the rage that lives within them can’t be contained.
      Whether this fury is a product of heritage or of nature, these adventurers
      have learned to harness it, turning its power against their foes. The
      primal warriors known as barbarians transform their rage into a potent
      weapon on a battlefield. Heedless of their wounds and possessed of
      unstoppable bloodlust, these savage brutes are the embodiment of
      war.</p><p><strong>Unchained:</strong> The unchained barbarian is similar
      in many regards to its counterpart in the Core Rulebook—she still goes
      into a rage and gains rage powers, but many of the details have been
      changed. Rage now grants temporary hit points and static bonuses on attack
      and damage rolls, rather than bonuses to ability scores that force players
      to recalculate a number of statistics. Additionally, many rage powers now
      function whenever the barbarian is raging, as opposed to just once per
      rage. Finally, the overall utility of many of the rage powers has been
      adjusted to make them more useful and interesting.</p><h2>Class
      Skills</h2><p>The barbarian’s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb
      (Str), Craft (Int), <em>Handle Animal</em> (Cha), Intimidate (Cha),
      Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis),
      and Swim (Str).</p>
