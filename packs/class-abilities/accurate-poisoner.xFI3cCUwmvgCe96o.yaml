  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent delivers poisons with deadly precision.
      When the character successfully hits an opponent with a poisoned weapon
      and would deal sneak attack damage, she can forgo the sneak attack damage
      and increase the poison’s potency. If she does, the poison’s duration
      increases by 2 (for example, large scorpion venom lasts for 8 rounds
      instead of 6 rounds, and drow poison lasts for 4 minutes instead of 2
      minutes).</p>
