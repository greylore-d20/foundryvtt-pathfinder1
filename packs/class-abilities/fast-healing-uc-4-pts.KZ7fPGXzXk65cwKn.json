The eidolon heals 1 point of damage per round, just like via natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive.</p>\n<p>This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as its summoner.</p>\n<p>This healing can be increased by 1 point per round for every 2 additional evolution points spent (to a maximum of 5 points per round).</p>"
