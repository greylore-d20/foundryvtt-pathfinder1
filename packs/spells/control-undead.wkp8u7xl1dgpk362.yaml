      <p>This spell enables you to control undead creatures for a short period
      of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what
      language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the
      controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects
      revert to their normal behavior.</p><p>Intelligent undead creatures
      remember that you controlled them, and they may seek revenge after the
      spell's effects end.</p>
