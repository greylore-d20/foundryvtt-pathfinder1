      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.6efjgs1qvmj6yxqv]{phantasmal killer},
      except it can affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures
      see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers
      as shadowy shapes.</p><p>If a subject's Fortitude save succeeds, it still
      takes 3d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. The subject also
      takes 1d4 points of Strength damage.</p>
