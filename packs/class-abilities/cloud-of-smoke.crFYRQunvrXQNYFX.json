Creatures inside the cloud take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and Perception skill checks for as long as they remain inside and for 1 round after exiting the cloud. Creatures inside the cloud gain concealment from attacks made by opponents that are not adjacent to them. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Fire Bolt power of the Fire Domain.</p>"
