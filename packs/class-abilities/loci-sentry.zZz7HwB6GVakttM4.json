The affected creature must succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. You are immediately aware of the sentryâ€™s activation. The sentry lasts for up to 1 hour per occultist level you possess, or until triggered.</p>\n<p>When you set the sentry, you can set any number of specif ic creatures to be immune to the sentry and thus avoid triggering it.</p>"
