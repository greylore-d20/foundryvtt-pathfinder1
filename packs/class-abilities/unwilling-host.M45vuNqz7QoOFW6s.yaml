  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You command spirits to invade the bodies of your enemies. Once per day
      as a standard action you may target a number of creatures equal to your
      Charisma modifier within 100 feet, no two of which can be more than 30
      feet apart. Targeted creatures must make a Will save or suffer the effects
      of a @Compendium[pf1.spells.n0bsyxchnigkkuqo]{Confusion} spell as the
      spirits possess them and cause them to behave erratically for a number of
      rounds equal to your oracle level.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
