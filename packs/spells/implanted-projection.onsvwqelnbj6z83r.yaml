  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>telempathic</i> projectionOA, except its
    mood-altering effects remain dormant in the target's mind. Upon casting this
    spell, the caster designates a command word or phrase, of which the target
    retains no memory. The next creature to speak the command word or phrase to
    the target triggers the implanted <i>telempathic</i> projection, treating
    the speaker as the original spellcaster.</p>
