    value: >-
      <p>Unlike a chain shirt, which covers only the chest, chainmail protects
      the wearer with a complete mesh of chain links that cover the torso and
      arms, and extends below the waist. Multiple interconnected pieces offer
      additional protection over vital areas. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
