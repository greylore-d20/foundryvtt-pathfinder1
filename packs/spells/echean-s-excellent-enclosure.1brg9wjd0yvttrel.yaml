  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You call into being around you an invisible barrier of force within which
    magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed
    and creatures are affected as by <i>antimagic field</i>. An immobile sphere
    of impenetrable force surrounds the field, equivalent in all ways to a
    spherical <i>Wall of Force</i>, including its immunity to <i>dispel
    magic</i> and vulnerability to a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> or <i>rod of
    cancellation</i>. The barrier has hardness 40 and 20 hit points per caster
    level, and can be damaged by both mundane attacks and spells cast from
    outside the field. If the bubble of force is destroyed, the spell's duration
    ends.</p><p>Spells cannot be cast within, into, or out of the enclosure, and
    teleportation effects that ignore a <i>Wall of Force</i> (such as
    <i>dimension door</i> or teleport) are thwarted by the enclosure's field of
    antimagic.</p><p>Echean's excellent enclosure has the same effect on
    summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead that an <i>antimagic
    field</i> does, causing them to wink out of existence for the duration of
    Echean's excellent enclosure unless their spell resistance, if any, allows
    them to remain where they are within the field.</p>
