      <p>When you make an undulating gesture using your hand, the target item
      changes slightly in shape and appearance to resemble a cross between its
      original form and that of a venomous animal. For example, a staff might
      change to resemble a snake, a shield might change to resemble an enormous
      venomous beetle, or the hilt of a sword might change to resemble a
      scorpion's tail.  If this spell is cast on a held item, the wielder adds
      his Will save bonus to the saving throw. You must be able to see the item
      to cast this spell on it.  The item retains all its properties, but
      whenever a creature picks up, attacks with, activates, or otherwise
      manipulates the item (with the exception of dropping the item) after this
      spell is cast, it animates and bites the creature. The attack is resolved
      before the action that triggered it. This spell otherwise does not affect
      the creature's ability to use the item.  If the item is a nonmagical
      weapon, it has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your
      spellcasting ability score modifier, and its attack deals 1d4 points of
      piercing damage. If the target item is a magic weapon, it retains any
      magical qualities, and its enhancement bonus is still added to both the
      attack roll and the damage roll.  A creature that takes damage from the
      bite is affected as if by a venomous snake's poison (<i>frequency</i>
      1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Con; <i>cure</i> 1 save). The
      poison's save DC is equal to this spell's DC.</p>
