    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, the swashbuckler gains a knack for getting out of
      trouble. Three times per day as an immediate action before attempting a
      saving throw, she can add her Charisma modifier to the result of the save.
      She must choose to do this before the roll is made.</p>

      <p>At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the number of times she can
      do this per day increases by one (to a maximum of 7 times per day at 18th
      level).</p>
