  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This very long, two-handed weapon has a slender but wickedly sharp
      4-foot-long blade at one end. It is predominantly used by ground troops to
      attack mounted warriors, and can be used to hack riders from their mounts
      or set to receive a charge.</p>
