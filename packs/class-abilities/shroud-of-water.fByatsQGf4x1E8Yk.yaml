      <p><b>Element</b> water; <b>Type</b> defense (Su); <b>Level</b> —;
      <b>Burn</b> 0</p>

      <p>You surround yourself with a shroud of water, ice, or both that
      protects you from harm. The shroud can either cover your body, functioning
      as armor, or float around you and block attacks, functioning as a shield.
      It grants either a +4 armor bonus to AC or a +2 shield bonus to AC, and
      you can change the type of bonus as a standard action. This bonus
      increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd.</p>

      <p>By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the bonus by 1 until the
      next time your burn is removed. You can increase the bonus multiple times
      in this way, but it can’t be increased by more than 50% of its starting
      value. When you change the shroud to grant a shield bonus, any bonus in
      excess of this limit doesn’t apply, but it remains if you change the
      shroud’s bonus type again.</p>

      <p>Whenever you accept burn while using a water wild talent, the water
      coalescing around you allows your shroud to grant both the armor bonus and
      the shield bonus for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an
      immediate action.</p>
