  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This flat, metal weapon consists of two joined crescent-shaped blades
      overlapping to form a hollow center with four projecting points. The
      blades can differ in length. One side of the center is wrapped to serve as
      a grip while the other acts as a guard. Deer horn knives are traditionally
      used in pairs.</p>
