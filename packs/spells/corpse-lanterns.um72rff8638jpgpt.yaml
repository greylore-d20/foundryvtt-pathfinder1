      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.zymaptg3vmnvfvxl]{dancing lights}, except
      it summons up to four spheres of light, each of which glows a sickly pale
      green. These <em>corpse lanterns</em> shed dim light in a 20-foot radius,
      and do not increase the light level in areas of normal light or bright
      light. In dim or normal light, the radiance of <em>corpse lanterns</em>
      provides a strange contrast, giving all creatures in the area a -5 penalty
      on Stealth checks. In addition, the hue interferes with illusion (pattern)
      spells, giving all creatures in the illuminated area a +2 bonus on any
      saving throws against such spells. Unlike <em>dancing lights</em>, you may
      have more than one <em>corpse lanterns</em> spell active at a time, but
      you may only move one set in any given round.</p><p>Moving the <em>corpse
      lanterns</em> does not require concentration.</p><p><em>Corpse
      lanterns</em> can be made permanent on an area with a <em>permanency</em>
      spell by a caster of at least 11th level for the cost of 7,500 gp.</p>
