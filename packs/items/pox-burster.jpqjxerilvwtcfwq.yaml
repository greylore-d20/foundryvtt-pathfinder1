      <p>A pox burster is an alchemically preserved animal bladder or gourd that
      has been filled with toxic, rotting materials. You can throw a pox burster
      as a <em>splash weapon</em>. Treat this attack as a ranged <em>touch
      attack</em> with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit forces a
      target to immediately make a DC 13 <em>Fortitude</em> save or contract
      filth fever. Every space adjacent to the target square of the pox burster
      is covered in <em>disease</em>-causing filth. For the next minute, any
      creature that is injured while in one of these spaces must also make a DC
      9 <em>Fortitude</em> save or contract filth fever.</p>
