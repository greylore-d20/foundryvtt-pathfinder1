  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, an order of the eel cavalier inspires diverse groups of
      allies against their common enemies, bringing them together based on their
      similarities while downplaying their differences. As a swift action, the
      cavalier can grant a competence bonus on weapon damage rolls to all allies
      within 30 feet. The bonus is equal to the number of distinct races in the
      ally group, including the cavalier’s race, up to a maximum bonus equal to
      the cavalier’s Charisma modifier (minimum +1). This bonus lasts for 1
      round. The cavalier can use this ability once per day, plus one additional
      time per day at 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
