    value: >-
      <p>You generate an arc of lightning between two targets. The lightning
      deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to
      both targets and any creatures in a line connecting them. The spell fails
      if there is no line of effect between the targets. <i>Lightning arc</i>
      sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt
      metals that have a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver,
      or bronze.</p>
