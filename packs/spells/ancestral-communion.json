If you have already failed at a Knowledge check, you may consult with your ancestors and make another attempt. The insight bonus on these checks increases to +6 at caster level 7th and +8 at caster level 11th. You may consult with the spirits for this purpose as often as you like while the spell remains in effect. Only you can hear the spirits speak to you.</p>",
