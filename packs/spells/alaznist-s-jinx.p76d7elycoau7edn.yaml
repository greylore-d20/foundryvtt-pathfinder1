    value: >-
      <p>You inflict a curse similar to the spell burn spellblight
      (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 97) on a creature. Each time a
      spellcaster who is afflicted with this curse casts a spell or uses a
      spell-like ability, her skin seems to burn as though she were on fire.
      With a successful concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level of
      the spell cast or spell-like ability used), the spellcaster can ignore the
      pain of the effect, but if she fails, she loses the spell or spell slot
      and is staggered for a round.  Unlike with the spell burn spellblight, the
      burning sensation is a tangible effect, visible during the act of
      spellcasting as an incorporeal, violet flame surrounding the caster.</p>
