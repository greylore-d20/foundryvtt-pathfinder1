      <p>If you have the change shape special quality, you can revert to your
      true form as a swift action. If a creature is not aware of your true form,
      when you use this spell to revert to your true form and attack that
      creature in the same round, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to
      AC against your first attack.</p>
