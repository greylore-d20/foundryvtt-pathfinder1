  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You flood yourself with a potent surge of elemental energy.</p><p>One
    round after completing the casting of the spell, the energy explodes from
    your body.</p><p>When this spell creates the explosion of energy, choose one
    of the following four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The
    explosion inflicts 1d8 points of damage of that energy type per caster level
    (maximum 10d8) to all creatures and unattended objects within 15 feet, and
    half that amount to targets past 15 feet but within 30 feet. You
    automatically take half damage from the explosion, without a saving throw,
    but any other energy resistance or energy immunity effects you may have in
    place can prevent or lessen this overflow damage caused by the
    explosion.</p>
