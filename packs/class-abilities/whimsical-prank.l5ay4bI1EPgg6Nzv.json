Resolve this attempt as normal, except that it doesnâ€™t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your oracle level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Charisma modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against this attempt, but a creature affected by this revelation cannot be the target of this revelation again for 1 day.</p>"
