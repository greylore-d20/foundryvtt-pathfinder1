    value: >-
      <p>You may transform into lightning as a standard action and instantly
      travel in a straight line to a distance of up to 120 feet, rematerializing
      in the new location as a free action. This movement does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. Creatures in this line take 10d6 points of
      electrical damage and are staggered for 1 round (a successful Reflex save
      halves the damage and negates the staggered condition, spell resistance
      applies).</p><p>Objects in your path are damaged as well, with combustible
      objects being set ablaze and metals with low melting points melted. If
      your path is interrupted by a barrier or otherwise deflected, you
      materialize short of your final destination in the nearest open space;
      targets in the line to that point take damage as normal. You are immune to
      electricity while this spell lasts.</p>
