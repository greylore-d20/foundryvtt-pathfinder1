It consists of four bedrolls, four blankets, a day's worth of <em>firewood</em>, a <em>flint and steel</em>, a tindertwig, four mess kits, a <em>cooking kit</em>, and 8 days of trail rations (with the expectation that adventurers will supplement the rations with a little hunting as they travel). Adventurers expecting inclement weather should also purchase one or more tents.</p>"
