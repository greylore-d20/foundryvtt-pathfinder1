  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a fist-sized, red-hot ball of molten metal that you
    immediately hurl as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of fire
    damage. Every creature within 5 feet of where the ball hits takes 1d6 points
    of fire damage from the splash (Reflex half). Each of these creatures takes
    an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on its turn for the next 1d3 rounds,
    unless it is cooled off (with water, snow, or any effect that deals 5 or
    more points of cold damage).</p>
