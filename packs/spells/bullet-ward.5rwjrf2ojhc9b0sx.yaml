  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You toss several adamantine bullets into the air, which then hover
      protectively nearby and intercept firearm attacks targeting you. The
      number of bullets protecting you is equal to half your caster level
      (maximum 4). When an opponent takes a shot at you with a firearm, as an
      immediate action you can designate a hovering bullet to attempt to block
      the attack, increasing your AC against that attack by 10. Doing this
      destroys the adamantine bullet whether or not the attack hits. The spell
      is discharged when all affected adamantine bullets are destroyed or taken
      from you. Each adamantine bullet has AC 24, 20 hit points, and hardness
      20.</p>
