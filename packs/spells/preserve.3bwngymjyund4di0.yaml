    value: >-
      <p>You imbue one or more objects with magic that dramatically slows down
      natural processes that lead to decay and spoilage. For the duration of the
      spell, food, water, plants, and other perishable objects affected by the
      spell remain as fresh as they were when the spell was cast. The spell also
      protects these objects against spells of the same level or lower that
      cause spoilage, such as <i>putrefy food and</i> drinkAPG. When the
      duration of <i>preserve</i> expires, the objects resume aging at their
      normal rate.  The spell also works on severed body parts and the bodies of
      small creatures as per <i>gentle repose</i>, provided that the weight of
      the creature or part does not exceed the spell's limit. <i>Preserve</i>
      can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 9th
      level or higher for 500 gp.</p>
