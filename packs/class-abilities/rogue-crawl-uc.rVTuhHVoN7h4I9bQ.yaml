  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While prone, a rogue with this ability can move at half speed. This
      movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. A rogue with this
      talent can take a 5-foot step while crawling, and she reduces her attack
      roll and AC penalties for being prone by 2.</p>
