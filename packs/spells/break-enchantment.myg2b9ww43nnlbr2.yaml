      <p>This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses.
      <i>Break enchantment</i> can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For
      each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level,
      maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success
      means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a
      cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.</p><p>If the
      spell is one that cannot be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>stone
      to flesh</i>, <i>break enchantment</i> works only if that spell is 5th
      level or lower.</p><p>If the effect comes from a permanent magic item,
      <i>break enchantment</i> does not remove the curse from the item, but it
      does free the victim from the item's effects.</p>
