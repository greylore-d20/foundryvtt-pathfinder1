      tools, chainsaws work remarkably well as weapons and are often used by
      lunatics or those who want to intimidate their enemies. A Numerian
      chainsaw consists of a weighty housing for the engine and power source
      that is fitted with two handles, and a 2- to 3-foot-long blade extending
      from the front, around which a whirling, buzzing chain of razorsharp
      cutting links spins at blinding speed when the weapon is activated. It's a
      standard action to activate a chainsaw, and doing so consumes a charge of
      power. The chainsaw continues to run constantly after activation, draining
      an additional charge each hour. A dropped chainsaw automatically turns off
      unless it is set down carefully as a move action. The buzzing of a
      chainsaw's blade is loud and distracting (but not deafening), causing
      anyone carrying an activated chainsaw to take a -10 penalty on Stealth
      checks. An activated chainsaw grants a proficient user a +2 morale bonus
      on Intimidate checks.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC
