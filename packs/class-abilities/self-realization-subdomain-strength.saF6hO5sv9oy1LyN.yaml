      Form (Su)}: You maintain an unshakable sense of who you are, and no force
      can compel you to be anything else. You gain a +1 sacred (if your patron
      is good or neutral) or profane (if your patron is evil) bonus on saving
      throws against polymorph, petrification, and transmutation effects. This
      bonus increases by 1 for every 5 cleric levels you have (maximum +5). Once
      per day when you succeed at a saving throw against such an effect, you can
      gain a surge of self-confidence as an immediate action that grants you a
      number of temporary hit points equal to your cleric level and a +2 morale
      bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws; both effects last
      for 1
      minute.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.WMtJbAlvzaLnzYVy]{Might
      of the Gods (Su)}: At 8th level, you can add your cleric level as an
      enhancement bonus to your Strength score for a number of rounds per day
      equal to your cleric level. This bonus only applies on Strength checks and
      Strength-based skill checks. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p><h3>Domain
