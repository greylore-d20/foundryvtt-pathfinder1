    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a
      standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch
      attack. Against evil creatures, this ray deals 1d4 points of damage + 1
      for every two sorcerer levels you possess. This damage is divine and not
      subject to energy resistance or immunity. This ray heals good creatures of
      1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. A good
      creature cannot benefit from your heavenly fire more than once per day.
      Neutral creatures are neither harmed nor healed by this effect. You can
      use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Charisma</em> modifier.</p>
