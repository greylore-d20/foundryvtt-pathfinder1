      <p>An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from
      approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting
      (to the limit your level allows). Any creature within or entering the
      field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward
      you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures' actions are not
      otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells
      and attack you with ranged weapons.</p><p>If you move closer to an
      affected creature, nothing happens. The creature is not forced back. The
      creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within
      reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn
      back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the
      spell's area.</p>
