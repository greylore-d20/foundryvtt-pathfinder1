      <p>Spending a moment in meditation and conjuring an image of the creature
      to mind, you reshape your link with your familiar, causing it to functions
      like a scrying sensor. Upon this spell you can hear, see, or smell (any
      one, your choice) what your familiar is experiencing. You gain the
      benefits of any nonmagical special abilities your familiar has tied to the
      chosen sense (such as low-light vision or scent), but use your own
      Perception skill. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your
      familiar, but you must have an active empathic link. You may change the
      sense you are sharing as a standard action. Unlike other scrying spells,
      share senses does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to
      work through it, and you are unable to see in magical or natural darkness
      unless your familiar possesses the ability to see in such
      conditions.</p><p>The sensory link with your familiar can be detected as
      though it were a scrying sensor.</p>
