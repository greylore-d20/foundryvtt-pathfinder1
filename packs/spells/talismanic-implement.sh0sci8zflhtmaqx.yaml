    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.4br9puuneexco5hx]{contingency}, but you
      invest a spell whose level doesn't exceed one-quarter of your level
      (rounded down, maximum spell level 3rd) into one of your implements that
      holds 2 or more points of mental focus. The spell's school must match that
      of the implement, and the spell must be one that affects only your person.
      Casting <em>talismanic implement</em> reduces the selected implement's
      mental focus by 2, including for the purposes of determining the effects
      of resonant powers. When you refresh your mental focus, <em>talismanic
      implement</em> ends automatically, even if the duration hasn't elapsed.
      Unlike <em>contingency</em>, you may have multiple <em>talismanic
      implement</em>s simultaneously, though a single implement can hold only
      one <em>talismanic implement</em> spell, and if you have any
      <em>talismanic implement</em>s, you can't have any other kind of
      <em>contingency</em> in effect.</p>
