      "value": "<p>A bard of 12th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to the <em>mass cure serious wounds</em>, using the bardâ€™s level as the <em>caster level</em>. In addition, this performance removes the <em>fatigued</em>, <em>sickened</em>, and <em>shaken</em> condition from all those affected. Using this ability requires 4 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. Soothing performance relies on audible and visual components.</p>"
