  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can walk across lava, magma, and similarly heated stone at your
      normal movement speed. You are immune to any fire damage caused by the
      surface while you walk above it, even if it radiates damage at a distance.
      While using lava walk, you never slip or fall from poor or slippery
      footing. You can use lava walk for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This
      duration doesnâ€™t need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute
      increments.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>
