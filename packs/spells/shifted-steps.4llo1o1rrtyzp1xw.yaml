      <p>You cause the target to sound as if it is elsewhere within range,
      including its movements, speech, and all other sounds. As long as you
      concentrate, you can cause the sound's apparent location to change as you
      see fit within range from your current location. Once you cease
      concentrating, the sound moves so that it remains the same relative
      distance and direction from the target. This spell can fool any
      sound-based blindsense or blindsight (including echolocation), but it
      can't fool other forms of detection such as other forms of blindsense or
      blindsight, lifesense, normal vision, and tremorsense. The target receives
      a saving throw against the effect if it doesn't wish for you to shift its
      sound, and any creature that interacts with the illusion receives a Will
      save to disbelieve the glamer.</p>
