  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures and
    obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past.
    Against creatures and moveable objects this stream acts as a bull rush. You
    can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than
    your own. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each
    creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your
    caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever
    is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of
    opportunity.</p><p>Against immovable objects this stream instead allows you
    to make a Strength check to destroy the target. When attempting to break an
    object, the stream has an effective Strength equal to your caster level plus
    the ability score modifier as above. The Break DC depends on the object
    you're trying to break-page 175 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Core
    Rulebook</i></i> lists several sample Break DCs for various
    objects.</p><p><i>Hydraulic torrent</i> extinguishes any normal fires it
    encounters along its path. Magical fires are unaffected.</p>
