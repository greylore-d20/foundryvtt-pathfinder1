  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You concentrate the healing potential of the material component so that
    it's exceptionally potent and restorative. This spell restores a number of
    hit points equal to 1d8 + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) to the
    target, and also grants the target the benefits of the material component.
    Roll the hit points restored separately when determining how many total hit
    points this spell and the material component restore.</p>
