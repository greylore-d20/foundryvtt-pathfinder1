    value: >-
      <p>The subject of this spell gains two benefits. First, the affected
      creature gains the ability to create a sound like the blast of a mighty
      horn or trumpet simply by miming the action of sounding one. Second, the
      subject can speak in a booming voice that carries easily over great
      distances, lowering the DC of any check to hear what is said by -15. This
      spell is particularly prized by battlefield commanders and champions who
      wish to make themselves clearly heard or gain the attention of their
      allies or foes.</p>
