However, any creature that injures you with a natural or unarmed attack must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a> save or take 1 point of damage. Any creature swallows you it takes 1 point of damage each round until it either spits you up, you escape, or you die (at which point the vest has sustained enough damage to no longer serve as a threat). The vest can only be worn over light armor or no armor.</p> \n"
