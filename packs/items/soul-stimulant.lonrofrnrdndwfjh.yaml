      <p>This soothing elixir was created to counter the energy-draining effects
      of <em>vampires</em>, <em>wights</em>, and similar horrible creatures. If
      you have a <em>negative level</em> (whether temporary or permanent), you
      can drink a dose of soul stimulant, negating the <em>negative level's</em>
      penalty for 12 hours. You can only benefit from 1 dose of soul stimulant
      at a time, though you can continue to take a dose every 12 hours to stave
      off the <em>negative level's</em> effects.</p>
