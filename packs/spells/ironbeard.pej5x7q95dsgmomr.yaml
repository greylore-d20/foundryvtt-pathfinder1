    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes a brushy beard of stiff iron to erupt from the face
      of a willing target. The <i>ironbeard</i> grants a +1 armor bonus to AC,
      and this bonus stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The
      <i>ironbeard</i> may also be used as a weapon equivalent to cold iron
      armor spikes. The <i>ironbeard</i> makes it difficult to speak, so any
      spellcasting with a verbal component has a 20% spell failure chance.</p>
