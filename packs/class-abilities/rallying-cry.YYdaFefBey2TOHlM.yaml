    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, as a <em>standard action</em> once per day, you can shout
      a cry instilled with the noble sacrifices of your ancestor. You and any
      allies within 30 feet who can hear you gain a +1 <em>morale bonus</em> on
      attack and damage rolls for a number of rounds equal to half your
      <em>sorcerer</em> level (minimum 1). At 7th level and every four levels
      thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 19th
      level.</p>
