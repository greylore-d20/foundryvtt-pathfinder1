      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> Pathfinder RPG Bestiary pg. 314</p><p><em>You can create construct creatures like golems.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Caster level 5th, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create any construct whose prerequisites you meet. The act of animating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To create a construct, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price, plus the full cost of the basic body created for the construct. Each construct has a special section that summarizes its costs and other prerequisites. A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.</p>"
