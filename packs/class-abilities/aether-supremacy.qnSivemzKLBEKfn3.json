This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 wizard levels you have. In addition, you can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.p8lm7khq3ynyif21]{mage hand} at will as a spell-like ability that uses your caster level. At 5th level, you can attempt Sleight of Hand checks against a target within 30 feet, though the skill check DC increases by 5, and any creature within line of sight of either you or the target can attempt an opposed @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.2h6hz5AkTDxKPFxr]{Perception} check to notice the attempt. At 10th level, you can attempt a Sleight of Hand check as a move action with only a â€“10 penalty. At 20th level, whenever you attempt a Sleight of Hand check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.</p>"
