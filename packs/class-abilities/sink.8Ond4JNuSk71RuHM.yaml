    value: >-
      <p>The witch can cause a creature in water to struggle, imposing a –4
      penalty on its Swim checks and reducing its swim speed (if any) by 10 feet
      for 1 minute unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw; on a
      successful save, the effect’s duration is reduced to 1 round.</p>

      <p>The duration of this hex can be extended with the cackle hex.</p>
