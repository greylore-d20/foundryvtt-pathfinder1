      <p>This spell functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.2p6fzj5t03oivndd]{command}, except that up to one
      creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1
      round. At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first,
      it gets another Will save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each
      creature must receive the same command.</p>
