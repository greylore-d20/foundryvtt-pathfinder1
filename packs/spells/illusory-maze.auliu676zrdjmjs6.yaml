  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell creates the illusion of a translucent, ever-changing maze of
    glass in the target area. Creatures in the area who believe the maze to be
    real cannot move more than 5 feet continuously in any one direction and
    can't move diagonally, forcing them to take a circuitous route to their
    destination.</p>
