      <p><b>Element</b> air; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 1;

      <p>You can create a light breeze that blows against a creature or object
      from a direction of your choice that follows the target wherever it goes.
      The breeze grants the subject a +2 bonus on saves against very hot
      conditions, severe heat, breath weapons, and cloud vapors and gases (such
      as cloudkill, stinking cloud, and inhaled poisons). This wild talent
      doesnâ€™t function without air or while underwater. You can have only one
      such breeze active at any one time.<p>You can also use your aerokinesis to
      make it harder to detect you or others by scent. You can designate a
      number of creatures or objects equal to your Constitution bonus. These
      creatures and objects always count as being downwind for the purpose of
      determining the distance at which they can be detected by scent. This
      effect lasts for 1 hour or until you use basic aerokinesis again,
      whichever comes first.</p>
