      <p>As a full-round action, you can expend two daily uses of bombs to
      create a syringe stirge, a tiny construct primed with a bomb (if you have
      multiple types of bombs, you must select which type the syringe stirge
      carries when created). Undirected, they take no actions except to flock
      around you in your square and follow you as best they can. They can be
      attacked normally, but gain cover while occupying your square. As a swift
      action, you can order one of your syringe stirges to attack an enemy it
      can see. Once ordered to attack that enemy, the syringe stirge will
      continue to attack every round, attempting to attach and deliver its
      payload.<p>A syringe stirge has all of the statistics of a <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Stirge">stirge</a>
      but lacks the blood drain ability. If it ends its turn attached to an
      opponent, it injects your bomb into the opponent’s bloodstream, dealing
      damage as a direct hit plus the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier (as the
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.gGfXQq0IZrxdcZDx]{Throw Anything} feat—this
      injection is a direct attack and doesn’t deal splash damage. A syringe
      stirge dies immediately after injecting its bomb. A syringe stirge lasts
      for 1 minute per alchemist level or until destroyed; if it has not
      attached to an enemy before the end of its life span it and its bomb
      payload fall inert. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before
      selecting this discovery.</p>
