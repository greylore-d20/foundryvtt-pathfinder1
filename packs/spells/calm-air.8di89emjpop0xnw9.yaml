      <p>This spell calms the air and disperses fog, dust, and other particles.
      The wind force in the area is reduced in strength by one step per 4 caster
      levels (to a minimum wind force of light) and clouds are dispersed,
      although parts of nonmagical clouds that extend beyond the area are not
      affected. If a magical cloud or wind's point of origin is inside the area
      of a <i>calm air</i> spell, the whole effect is suppressed; otherwise,
      only the part inside the area is suppressed. Suppression still counts
      against the duration of a wind or cloud effect. Magical wind and cloud
      effects are suppressed only if you succeed at a caster level check (DC 11
      + effect's caster level). You can move the <i>calm air</i> effect by
      concentrating as a standard action.</p>
