The quill is typically white in color, though variations that are crimson, onyx, or some combination of these colors also exist. A hidden compartment inside the nib allows the quill to hold a single dose of <em>poison</em> that is dispensable with a small squeeze. Additionally, this provides a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Sleight of Hand</em> checks to conceal poisons inside the quill. If this quill is used with vector ink, it increases the DC of a poison mixed with the ink by 1.</p>\n<p>This quill can be used as a small shiv to deal 1d3 points of damage and deliver its contained poison. However, because of the fragility of the nib, using the quill in this way destroys it.</p>\n<h4>Wax, Sealing</h4>\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1110</em></p>\n<p>Solid wax used for sealing scroll tubes or <em>scrolls</em> together.</p>"
