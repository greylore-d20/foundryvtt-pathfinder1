      <p>Cast this spell when a creature within range casts a spell that
      provides an effect for its allies (such as <i>bless</i> or prayer). You
      are considered an ally of the caster for the purposes of that spell.
      Although you are momentarily considered an ally, the caster need not
      target you if the spell requires that the caster select one or more allies
      to be affected by the spell (as does haste). This spell does not allow a
      target spell to affect more creatures than described in its target entry.
      If this spell would raise the total number of affected targets above that
      allowed by the target spell, <i>opportunistic loyalty</i> has no
      effect.</p>
