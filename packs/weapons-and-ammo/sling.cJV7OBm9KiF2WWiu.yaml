  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of
      strings. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a
      sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a
      sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two
      hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.</p><p>A sling fires sling
      bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as
      dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the
      weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and
      you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
