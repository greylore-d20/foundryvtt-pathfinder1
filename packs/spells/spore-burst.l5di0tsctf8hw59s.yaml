    value: >-
      <p>You cause a willing plant creature's body to sprout small, puffy
      mushrooms that remain for 1 round per caster level or until the creature
      uses them. As a standard action, the target can cause these mushrooms to
      burst open, releasing a cloud of toxic spores that affect all creatures in
      a 20-foot-radius spread. Those in the area must succeed at Fortitude saves
      or be sickened for 1d6 rounds as they are overcome by sneezing and
      coughing. The caster is immune to this poison effect, as are all creatures
      of the plant type.</p>
