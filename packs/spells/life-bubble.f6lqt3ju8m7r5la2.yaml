    value: >-
      <p>You surround the touched creatures with a constant and moveable 1-inch
      shell of tolerable living conditions. This shell enables the subjects to
      breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making them
      immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and poisons
      and spells like <i>cloudkill</i> and <i>stinking cloud</i>. In addition,
      the shell protects subjects from extremes of temperature (per <i>endure
      elements</i>) as well as extremes of pressure.</p><p><i>Life bubble</i>
      does not provide protection from negative or positive energy (such as
      found on the Negative and Positive Energy planes), the ability to see in
      conditions of poor visibility (such as in smoke or fog), nor the ability
      to move or act normally in conditions that impede movement (such as
      underwater).</p><p>When you cast this spell it has a total duration of 2
      hours per caster level. You can divide this duration up in any manner you
      wish, not necessarily equally, between up to 1 creature per caster
      level.</p>
