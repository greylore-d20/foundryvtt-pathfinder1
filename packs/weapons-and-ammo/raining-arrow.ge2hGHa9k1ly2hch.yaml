      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This thick-shafted arrow contains a reservoir of holy water and is
      designed to burst upon impact.</p>

      <p>A raining arrow damages the target as normal, and also treats the
      target as though it had been struck by a direct hit from a thrown vial of
      @Compendium[pf1.items.CmjSKOVJuQnV8o3S]{Holy water}; adjacent creatures
      take splash damage from this effect.</p>

      <p>A raining arrow imparts a <b>-2 penalty on attack rolls</b> because of
      its weight.</p>

      <p>A raining arrow costs 30 gp, and can be crafted with a successful DC 25
      Craft (alchemy) check.</p>
