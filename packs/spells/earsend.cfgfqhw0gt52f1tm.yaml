      <p>You cause one of your ears to tear itself free of your body and
      transform into a fly-like magical creature you control. This functions
      like skinsendUM, except your ear is a Fine construct with a fly speed
      equal to your base speed and a bonus on Fly checks equal to half your
      caster level. Your sense of hearing functions from your animated ear as if
      it were connected to your head, allowing you to hear as well as you
      normally could from your animated ear's vantage point.</p>
