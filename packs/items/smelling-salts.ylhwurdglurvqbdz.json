Smelling salts grant you a new <em>saving throw</em> to resist any spell or effect that has already rendered you <em>unconscious</em> or <em>staggered</em>. If exposed to smelling salts while <em>dying</em>, you immediately become conscious and <em>staggered</em>, but must still make stabilization checks each round; if you perform any <em>standard action</em> (or any other strenuous action) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act and fall <em>unconscious</em> again. A container of smelling salts has dozens of uses if stoppered after each use, but depletes in a matter of hours if left opened.</p>\n<p><b>Create</b>: <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC 20</p>"
