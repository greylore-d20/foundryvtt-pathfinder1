      <p>You fill the target’s mind with childlike wonder, allowing that
      creature to marvel at things that would be debilitating to others.
      Penalties that the target would take as a result of an emotion effect are
      instead treated as morale bonuses equal to half the penalty’s value (for
      example, if the target were affected by a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zt7cje76dck9hwp9]{crushing despair} spell, she
      would gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, ability
      checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls, instead of the spell’s
      normal effect). Furthermore, morale bonuses she gains from other sources
      are increased by 1. Finally, the target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws
      to resist spells of the pattern subschool, as her childlike wonder allows
      her to marvel at the beauty of such effects without being overwhelmed by
      them.</p>
