    value: >-
      <p>Choose chaos, evil, good, or law. You can channel divine energy to
      affect outsiders that possess this
      subtype.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Ability to channel
      energy.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Instead of its normal effect, you
      can choose to have your ability to channel energy heal or harm outsiders
      of the chosen alignment subtype. You must make this choice each time you
      channel energy. If you choose to heal or harm creatures of the chosen
      alignment subtype, your channel energy has no effect on other creatures.
      The amount of damage healed or dealt and the DC to halve the damage is
      otherwise unchanged.</p><p><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this
      feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this
      feat, it applies to a new alignment subtype. Whenever you channel energy,
      you must choose which type to effect.</p>
