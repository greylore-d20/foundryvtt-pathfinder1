Many undead, however, are mindless and gain no skill points or feats. The following are class skills for undead: <em>Climb</em>, <em>Disguise</em>, <em>Fly</em>, <em>Intimidate</em>, <em>Knowledge</em> (arcane), <em>Knowledge</em> (religion), <em>Perception</em>, <em>Sense Motive</em>, <em>Spellcraft</em>, and <em>Stealth</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Traits\">Traits</span></h2>\n<p>An undead creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Constitution score. Undead use their&nbsp;<em>Charisma</em>&nbsp;score in place of their Constitution score when calculating hit points,&nbsp;<em>Fortitude</em>&nbsp;saves, and any special ability that relies on Constitution (such as when calculating a breath weapon’s DC).</li>\n<li><em>Darkvision</em>&nbsp;60 feet.</li>\n<li>Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms).</li>\n<li>Immunity to death effects, disease, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.</li>\n<li>Not subject to nonlethal damage,&nbsp;<em>ability drain</em>, or energy drain.
