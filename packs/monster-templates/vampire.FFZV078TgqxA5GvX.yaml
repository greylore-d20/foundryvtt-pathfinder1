      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Creating a Vampire<p>“Vampire” is an
      acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more
      Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most vampires were
      once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vampire uses the base
      creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.<p><b>CR:</b> Same as
      the base creature + 2.<p><b>AL:</b> Any evil.<p><b>Type:</b> The
      creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class
      Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.<p><b>Senses:</b> A vampire gains darkvision 60
      ft.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by +6.<p><b>Hit Dice:</b>
      Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As
      undead, vampires use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points
      (instead of Constitution).<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A vampire gains
      channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and silver, and resistance to cold 10
      and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted
      by the undead type. A vampire also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0
      hit points in combat, a vampire assumes gaseous form (see below) and
      attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be
      utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.)
      Additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no
      effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point
      after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate
      of 5 hit points per round.<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Vampires cannot tolerate
      the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it.
      Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols.
      These things don’t harm the vampire—they merely keep it at bay. A
      recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy
      symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature.
      Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire
      can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round
      it makes a DC 25 Will save.<p>Vampires cannot enter a private home or
      dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do
      so.<p>Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but
      doesn’t always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can
      slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the
      first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive
      round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in
      running water inflicts damage on a vampire equal to one-third of its
      maximum hit points—a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is
      destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire’s heart
      instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to
      life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed
      with holy water.<p><b>Speed:</b> Same as the base creature. If the base
      creature has a swim speed, the vampire is not unduly harmed by running
      water.<p><b>Melee:</b> A vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature
      didn’t have one. Damage for the slam depends on the vampire’s size (see
      Natural Attacks). Its slam also causes energy drain (see below). Its
      natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming
      damage reduction.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A vampire gains several
      special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 vampire’s HD + vampire’s
      Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.<p><em>Blood Drain (Su): </em>A
      vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire
      establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary
      hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points
      equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains
      blood.<p><em>Children of the Night (Su):</em> Once per day, a vampire can
      call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard
      action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon
      other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds
      and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.<p><em>Create Spawn (Su):</em> A
      vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy
      drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as
      the vampire’s base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire
      in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that created
      it, and remains enslaved until its master’s destruction. A vampire may
      have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any
      spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. A
      vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but
      once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved
      again.<p><em>Dominate (Su): </em>A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent’s
      will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a
      Will save or fall instantly under the vampire’s influence, as though by a
      dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30
      feet. At the GM’s discretion, some vampires might be able to affect
      different creature types with this power.<p><em>Energy Drain (Su):</em> A
      creature hit by a vampire’s slam (or other natural weapon) gains two
      negative levels. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of
      the number of attacks a vampire makes.<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> A
      vampire gains the following.<p><em>Change Shape (Su):</em> A vampire can
      use change shape to assume the form of a dire bat or wolf, as beast shape
      II.<p><em>Gaseous Form (Su):</em> As a standard action, a vampire can
      assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous
      indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect
      maneuverability.<p><em>Shadowless (Ex):</em> A vampire casts no shadows
      and shows no reflection in a mirror.<p><em>Spider Climb (Ex):</em> A
      vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider
      climb spell.<p><b>Ability Scores</b> Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha
      +4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution
      score.<p><b>Skills</b> Vampires gain a +8 racial bonus on Bluff,
      Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.<p><b>Feats</b> Vampires gain
      Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning
      Reflexes, and Toughness as bonus feats.</p>
