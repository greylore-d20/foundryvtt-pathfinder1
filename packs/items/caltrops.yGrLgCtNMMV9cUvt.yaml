      <p>A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that one prong
      always faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter
      caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are
      at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops
      covers an area 5 feet square.</p><p>Each time a creature moves into an
      area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in
      such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll
      for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this
      attack, the creature’s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count.
      If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor
      bonus to AC. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a
      caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature’s speed is
      reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts
      for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal
      check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A
      charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a
      caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way
      through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p><p>Caltrops may not work
      against unusual opponents.</p>
