    value: >-
      <p>The subject can <i>fly</i> at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it
      wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy
      load).</p><p>It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and
      its maneuverability is good. Using a <i>fly</i> spell requires only as
      much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells
      normally. The subject of a <i>fly</i> spell can charge but not run, and it
      cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it
      wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your
      caster level.</p><p>Should the spell duration expire while the subject is
      still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet
      per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time,
      it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6
      points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively
      ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the <i>fly</i>
      spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an <i>antimagic
      field</i>.</p>
