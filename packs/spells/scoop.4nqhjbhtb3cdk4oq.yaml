    value: >-
      <p>You will a small vessel of force into existence. As a move action, you
      can direct the container up to 15 feet per round in any direction, though
      the spell ends if the distance between you and the container ever exceeds
      the spell's range. You can dip the container to pick up or drop a liquid
      as a move action. The vessel holds up to 1 pint of liquid or small
      objects, weighing up to 5 pounds. You can also gather up a pint of liquid
      or small objects spread cross a surface with 1 minute of careful
      concentration.</p><p>Editor's note: The following spells are different
      from your standard cantrips. They are rare cantrips. Spellcasters that
      gain access to all 0-level spells at 1st level do not gain access to rare
      cantrips. A spellcaster gains access to rare cantrips only by uncovering
      their secrets in some other way. Some are guarded by jealous mages, while
      others are lost in missing libraries or molder on forgotten scrolls.</p>
