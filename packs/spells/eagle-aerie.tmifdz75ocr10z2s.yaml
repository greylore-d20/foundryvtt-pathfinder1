  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a flight of giant eagles (one per three caster levels,
      maximum of six; <i>Bestiary</i> 118) to ferry you and your allies across
      the skies. The eagles avoid combat if possible but defend themselves if
      attacked; if the eagles attack, the remaining duration of the spell
      changes from 1 hour per level to 1 round per level (so if the spell had 5
      full hours left, the eagles remain in combat for 5 rounds before the spell
      ends).</p>
