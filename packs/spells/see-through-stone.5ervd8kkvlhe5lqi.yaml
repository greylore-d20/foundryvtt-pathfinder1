  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You gain the ability to see through solid rock as if it were transparent
    glass. You may see through 1 foot of stone per caster level. You see within
    the stone as if you were looking at the area in normal light, even if there
    is no illumination, though low-light vision and darkvision have no effect on
    your ability to see through stone. Metal at least 1 inch thick or wood or
    dirt at least 3 feet thick blocks your vision.</p><p>The spell does not
    negate concealment for those creatures hiding behind stone objects (the
    stone is still an obstacle to your attacks).</p>
