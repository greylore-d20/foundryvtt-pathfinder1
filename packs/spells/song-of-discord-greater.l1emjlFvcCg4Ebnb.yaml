      <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.1os71jpk7lrrl47b]{song
      of discord} except that affected creatures automatically attack the
      nearest target each round. In addition, all affected creatures gain a +4
      morale bonus to Strength for the duration of the spell. A creature that
      succeeds at the Will save reduces the effectâ€™s duration to 1 round.</p>
