      <p>The target is suddenly beset with unexplainable doubts about the
      effectiveness of its actions and the righteousness of its cause. The
      creature takes a -10 penalty on its ability checks, skill checks, and
      concentration checks, until the duration ends, or until it spends its
      entire turn doing absolutely nothing (it spends a full-round action
      gaining focus). Spending an entire turn doing nothing discharges the
      spell.</p>
