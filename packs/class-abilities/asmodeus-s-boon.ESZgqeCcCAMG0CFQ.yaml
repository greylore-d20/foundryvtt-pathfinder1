  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and takes damage from one of
      your spells, it is shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spellâ€™s
      level. Spells that do not allow saves do not cause creatures to become
      shaken. This does not stack with other fear effects.</p>
