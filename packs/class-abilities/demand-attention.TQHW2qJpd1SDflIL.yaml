  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The first time each round that you deal sneak attack damage to an
      opponent, you can forgo sneak attack damage to distract the creature. The
      target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of sneak attack
      dice sacrificed + your Charisma modifier) or become distracted until the
      start of your next turn. Distracted opponents are entirely focused on you,
      and pay little attention to their surroundings; they are not considered to
      be observing other characters within 30 feet, allowing them to attempt
      Stealth checks to hide. A distracted opponent automatically fails
      Perception checks against creatures more than 30 feet away.</p>
