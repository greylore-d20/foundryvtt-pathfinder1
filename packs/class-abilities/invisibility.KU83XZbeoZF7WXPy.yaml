    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can become invisible (as per the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility} spell). You can
      remain invisible for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does
      not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute
      increments.</p>

      <p>Starting at 9th level, each time you activate this ability you can
      treat it as @Compendium[pf1.spells.cxgi0ub77t6aink1]{Invisibility,
      Greater}, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your
      normal invisibility duration.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>
