They are usually eaten as a spread on crackers, boiled eggs, bread, pastries, or vegetables. They tend to spoil quickly and are rare outside of the coastal areas where they are harvested. Purists only consider sturgeon eggs to be true caviar, but others are more relaxed about the definition and include salmon, trout, and whitefish eggs as caviar. In some countries, the roe of larger exotic fish and sea creatures (such as chuul, giant gar, and reefclaws) are eaten as caviar, though at much higher prices.</div>"
