      "value": "<p>Whenever the magus casts a spell of the polymorph subschool on himself, he can draw a card from a complete harrow deck he owns as a free action. If the card’s alignment and the magus’s alignment are a true match, the spell’s duration is doubled and the magus can select two additional monster abilities granted by the polymorph spell (such as scent or grab for&nbsp;beast shape II), even if the form assumed by the magus doesn’t normally grant that ability. On a partial match, the magus can select an additional ability granted by the polymorph spell, even if the form assumed by the magus doesn’t normally grant that ability. On an opposite match, the duration of the spell is halved and the magus must forgo one of the abilities granted by his form.</p>\n<p>The magus must be at least 9th level before selecting this arcana.</p>"
