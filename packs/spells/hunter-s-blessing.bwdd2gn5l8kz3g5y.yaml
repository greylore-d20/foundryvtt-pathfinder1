      <p>When casting this spell, you designate a type or type and subtype of
      creature (using the ranger's favored enemy categories; <i>Pathfinder RPG
      <i>Core Rulebook</i></i> 6 4) and a type of terrain (using the list of
      ranger's favored terrain categories, <i>Core Rulebook</i> 65).
      <b>Target</b>s of the spell gain a +2 sacred bonus on Bluff, Perception,
      Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against creatures of the
      selected type, and a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made
      against creatures of that type. Furthermore, they gain a +2 sacred bonus
      on initiative checks, Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while they
      are in the type of terrain you designate. Lastly, when tracking the
      designated creature type in the chosen terrain, the targets can follow the
      tracks of such creatures untrained, even if the DC for the task is 11 or
      higher.</p>
