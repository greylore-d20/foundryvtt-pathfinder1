      felt lined and have a thin layer of metal around the soles. The top of
      each boot ends just before the knee, with a cord for tying the top shut
      over clothing or exposed skin. These boots assist in prolonged hikes
      through deep mud or shallow pools, granting the wearer a +1 circumstance
      bonus on Profession (fisher) checks while fishing in shallow water.</p>
