    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, the cavalier gains a swim speed equal to his unmodified
      base land speed. If he already has a swim speed, his swim speed increases
      by 10 feet, and if he and his mount both have a swim speed, the mountâ€™s
      swim speed also increases by 10 feet. He gains a +1 morale bonus on damage
      rolls when underwater.</p>
