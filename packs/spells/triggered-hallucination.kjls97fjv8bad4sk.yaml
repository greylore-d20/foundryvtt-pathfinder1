      <p>This spell functions as <i><i>audiovisual</i> hallucination</i> (see
      page 204), except that this spell's phantasm has no apparent effect until
      a specific condition occurs. You must overcome the target's spell
      resistance to plant the <i>triggered hallucination</i>, but the target
      doesn't attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition
      occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with
      <i><i>audiovisual</i> hallucination</i>). The phantasm can include
      auditory, olfactory, visual, tactile, and thermal elements, including
      intelligible speech.  You set the triggering condition (such as hearing a
      certain word or seeing a type of creature) when casting the spell. The
      event that triggers the illusion can be as general or detailed as desired
      but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger.
      The trigger can't be based on any quality not  normally obvious to the
      senses, such as alignment. <i>Triggered hallucination</i> uses the
      target's senses to notice triggers.</p>
