    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, as a standard action, you can take control of the body
      of a sleeping creature within 30 feet for 1 hour per level. This ability
      functions like @Compendium[pf1.spells.8ai7fslz4zu8xe9s]{Magic Jar}, except
      that your soul travels directly into the sleeping target with no
      receptacle necessary and the target creature’s consciousness remains
      dreaming and unaware of its body’s actions. When waking dream ends or the
      host body is destroyed, you immediately wake up in your body regardless of
      the distance from the host body, provided your body hasn’t been
      destroyed.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your
      Charisma bonus.</p>

      <p>Creatures that don’t dream are immune to this effect.</p>
