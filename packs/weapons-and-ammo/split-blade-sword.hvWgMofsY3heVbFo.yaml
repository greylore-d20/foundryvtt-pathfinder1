  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Patterned after the fiery blades masterfully wielded by Sarenite
      angels, the split-blade sword is both a holy symbol and a
      difficult-yet-effective weapon. A split-blade sword resembles a large
      scimitar whose blade splits into two about two-thirds of the way toward
      the tip. If your Dexterity score is less than 15, you take a -2 penalty on
      attacks rolls with a split-blade sword, as you're unable to maneuver its
      unusual blade.</p>
