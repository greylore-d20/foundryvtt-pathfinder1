      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Price</b> varies; <b>Weight</b> varies</p>\r\n<p>Hellknights often equip their steeds with armor similar to their own. Typical <em>barding</em> for Hellknight steeds features ornamental spikes (these spikes deal no damage). Such <em>barding</em> is usually designed to look similar to the armor of the horse's rider, or to look skeletal, <em>fiendish</em>, or similar to a <em>nightmare</em>. Hellknight <em>barding</em> can be made from Hellknight leather, Hellknight half-plate, or Hellknight plate; it costs four times as much and weighs twice as much. Hellknight half-plate <em>barding</em> or Hellknight plate <em>barding</em> slows a mount's speed from 40 feet to 30 feet, from 50 feet to 35 feet, or from 60 feet to 40 feet. A mount wearing such armor moves at only triple its normal speed when running instead of quadruple.</p>\r\n\r\n"
