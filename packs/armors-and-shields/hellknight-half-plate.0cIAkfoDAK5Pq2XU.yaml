  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The armor worn by a Hellknight signifer is a vestment of armored
      plates, chain, and dark fabric. It functions as half-plate, but it can be
      donned and removed as though it were medium armor. Any spellcaster who
      wears this armor is treated as if he were wearing Hellknight plate for the
      purposes of any feats and effects that require one to be wearing
      Hellknight plate. This armor includes a signifer mask, though signifer
      masks can be purchased separately.</p>
