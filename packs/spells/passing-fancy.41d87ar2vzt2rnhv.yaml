      <p>Taldor's infamous Lion Blades imported this spell from the ninja clans
      of Minkai, and both groups use it to great effect when maneuvering among
      the shallow upper classes. When you cast the spell, you dictate one
      specific topic or recent event and instill a magical obsession with that
      subject within the target. An affected creature becomes fascinated by the
      topic, and becomes  completely focused on discussing the event with anyone
      nearby, possibly wandering off or distracting unaffected creatures.
      <i>Passing fancy</i> has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence of 2
      or less.  Because the target talks and interacts with its usual cadence,
      onlookers take a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to notice that
      anything is amiss with the target's behavior.</p>
