  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she
      can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a
      swift action once per round. If she has the
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.11ClnanF4PdEPd9g]{Rapid Reload} feat or is using an
      alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the
      weapon as a free action each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
