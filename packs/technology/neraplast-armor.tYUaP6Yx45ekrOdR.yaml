      ; <strong>Usage</strong> 1 charge</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This
      lightweight, formfitting bodysuit features a variety of pockets, straps,
      and a built-in interface for automatically adjusting the various colors
      and patterns on its fabric. Selecting a color or pattern is a full-round
      action that consumes 1 charge and provokes an attack of opportunity.
      Capable of cycling through dozens of hues, the armor can even be used to
      adopt sophisticated camouflage patterns that grant a +3 competence bonus
      on Stealth checks. Whenever the wearer enters a terrain of significantly
      different coloration and background patterns, the armor must be
      recalibrated to its current area to maintain this
      bonus.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 22;
