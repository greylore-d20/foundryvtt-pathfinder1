  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions similarly to <i>alter self</i>, except for the
      following differences. You assume the exact form of a deceased Small or
      Medium creature of the humanoid type. Your voice changes to match that of
      the form you assume. The creature whose form you assume must be dead and
      you must have access to its fresh corpse (either dead less than 24 hours,
      or preserved via <i>gentle repose</i> or similar effect). Any attempt to
      copy the form of a living creature causes the spell to fail. You do not
      have access to the assumed form's abilities, memories, mannerisms, or
      speech patterns. The spell grants a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear
      as the imitated creature.  If the assumed creature is returned to life
      while this spell is active, <i>assume appearance</i> immediately ends.</p>
