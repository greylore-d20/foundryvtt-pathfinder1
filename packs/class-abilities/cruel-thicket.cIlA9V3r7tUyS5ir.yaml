  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can cause the ground in a 5-foot-radius burst
      centered on you to sprout twisting, thorny vines. Any creature moving
      through it must travel at half speed or take bleed damage equal to half
      your cleric level; if you activate this ability in an area with numerous
      plants (grass, weeds, trees, etc.), the area also becomes difficult
      terrain. These effects last for 1 minute, after which the vines crumble to
      dust. Creatures able to move through natural undergrowth unhindered ignore
      the effects of this ability. You can use this ability a number of times
      per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Wooden Fist power of the Plant Domain.</p>
