    value: >-
      <p>You create a mental block in the target's mind, impeding the flow of
      his mental spellcasting process and forcing him to incorporate a thought
      component into any spell or spell-like ability he uses. This is in
      addition to any other components the spell already requires, and doesn't
      replace the verbal component. Spell-like abilities require this thought
      component, even though they normally don't need spell components.  As
      usual with thought components, this addition increases the DC of any
      concentration checks the target attempts by 10 unless the target takes a
      move action to center his mind and satisfy the spell's thought
      component.</p>
