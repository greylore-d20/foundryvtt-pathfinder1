    value: >-
      <p>Upon pointing at an armored foe, you cause all of the joints of the
      target's armor to stiffen as otherworldly chains wrap around the target.
      On a failed Reflex save, a target in heavy metal armor becomes staggered.
      A target in light or medium metal armor instead becomes entangled.
      <b>Target</b>s wearing no armor or nonmetallic armor are unaffected. If
      the target is wearing heavy metal armor and succeeds at its Reflex save,
      it becomes entangled instead of staggered; a target in light or medium
      metal armor that succeeds at its saving throw is unaffected by the
      spell.</p>
