  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A translucent barrier of pure sound springs into existence. This wall
      is silent except for a faint hum, but bursts with discordant noise when
      touched by an object or creature. The wall deflects arrows, bolts, loose
      debris, and Small or smaller flying creatures like a <i>wind wall</i>
      spell, except these things rebound harmlessly rather than being directed
      upward. The burst of discordant noise deals 2d4 points of sonic damage to
      creatures within 10 feet of the triggering object or creature; touching or
      passing through the wall deals 2d6 points of sonic damage + 1 point of
      sonic damage per caster level (maximum +20). If you evoke the wall so that
      it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing
      through the wall. A <i>silence</i> spell suppresses the wall within its
      area, but the wall reappears when the <i>silence</i> ends.</p>
