  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, the shaman can turn one of her arms into a heavy,
      branch-like limb. She must drop anything held in that hand, and she canâ€™t
      use this ability if she is wearing a shield on that arm. Until the
      beginning of her next turn, she gains a slam attack that deals 1d8 points
      of damage (for a Medium shaman; 1d6 if Small, 2d6 if Large).</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the reach of this slam attack increases by 5 feet.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the shaman can transform both of her arms, gaining two
      slam attacks.</p>

      <p>A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      her Charisma modifier.</p>
