  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell causes a weapon to veer closer to vital areas, improving the
    result of a critical threat. This transmutation grants a +2 bonus on attack
    rolls to confirm critical hits plus 1 additional bonus point per four caster
    levels (maximum total bonus +7). If the spell is cast on projectiles, the
    effect ends on a specific projectile whenever that projectile is used to
    make an attack, regardless of whether the attack hits. For this spell,
    shuriken are considered projectiles.</p>
