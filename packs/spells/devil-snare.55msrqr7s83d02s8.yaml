      <p>Your touch creates an invisible circle on a flat surface. Any outsider
      passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught
      within. Once trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard
      action to physically exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any
      form of extra<i>dimensional</i> travel (as per <i>dimensional</i> anchor).
      Contained outsiders can still attack adjacent creatures outside of the
      circle, or target others with ranged attacks, spells, and spell-like
      abilities. Despite the spell's name, <i>devil snare</i> captures outsiders
      of any type, not only devils.  As a standard action, you can dismiss the
      circle, expelling any outsiders still trapped within to their planes of
      origin (as per dismissal). An outsider can resist this effect with a
      successful Will save, enabling it to remain after the spell is
      dismissed.</p>
