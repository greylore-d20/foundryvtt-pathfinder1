      <p>This tool is perfect for its intended job. It grants a +2
      <em>circumstance bonus</em> on a related skill check (if any). The bonuses
      provided by multiple masterwork items do not stack.</p>

      <p>Several common items already count as masterwork tools for particular
      skills. These are the alchemist's lab, climber's kit, disguise kit,
      healer's kit, masterwork musical instrument, and masterwork thieves'
      tools. Therefore, there is no masterwork climber's kit, masterwork
      healer's kit, and so on-those items are already the best available for
      general checks with the relevant skill.</p>

      <p>Some skills have no appropriate tool or masterwork tool-no non-magical
      item exists that grants a bonus for all uses of that skill. For example,
      just because a certain perfume is favored by local nobles (granting a +2
      <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Diplomacy</em> checks to influence
      them) doesn't mean that perfume has the same effect on a member of the
      thieves' guild, a foreign berserker, or a medusa. Likewise, just because a
      fake beard woven by <em>dwarves</em> out of the beards of famous
      <em>dwarves</em> may grant a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Use
      Magic Device</em> checks to emulate the dwarven race doesn't mean the
      beard has any effect on using that skill to <em>activate</em> elven items
      or <em>paladin</em> items, or to decipher a written spell.</p>

      <p>Individual GMs may want to allow masterwork tools for other skills at
      the listed cost. The <em>circumstance bonus</em> for such a tool should
      never be more than +2. The tool should either have a limited number of
      uses (such as the disguise and healer's kits) or only apply to certain
      aspects of the skill (such as the balancing pole's bonus on
      <em>Acrobatics</em> checks to traverse a narrow surface or the magnifying
      glass's bonus on <em>Appraise</em> checks for detailed items).</p>
