      "value": "<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1140</em></p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 400 gp</p>\n<p>This foot-tall blue-green pitcher <em>plant</em> produces a pollen that smells faintly of mint and lures insects and even small vertebrates toward its dangerous mouth.</p>\n<p><b>Gather</b> DC 20; <b>Yield</b> 1 dose</p>\n<p><b>Terrain</b> warm forests or swamps</p>\n<p><b>Preparation</b> A dose of pollen must be mixed with alchemical reagents with a successful DC 16 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check and then left to sit for 1 hour before it can be used.</p>\n<p><b>Use</b> A dose of nepenthe pollen must be inhaled as a <em>standard action</em>, whereupon the potent vapors act upon unpleasant or unknown thoughts and memories. This grants the creature a new saving throw to immediately end a single <em>mind-affecting</em> effect currently affecting the creature (effects that allow no saving throw cannot be removed in this way). An unwilling creature can be dosed with the pollen as a <em>touch attack</em> that provokes an <em>attack of opportunity</em>. A creature can be affected by a dose of nepenthe only once in a single 24-hour period. This is a <em>poison</em> effect.</p>"
