      <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that using the
      material component, you scribe a <i>Symbol of Striking</i> so it fills a
      5-foot square. Once triggered, the <i>Symbol of Striking</i> glows and 
      lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has made a number of
      attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever comes first. When
      triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it
      were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as
      the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence
      modifier (magus, witch, wizard) or Wisdom modifier (cleric) or Charisma
      modifier (oracle, sorcerer) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a
      number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability
      score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on
      damage rolls equal to the same ability score modifier you used to
      determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version of you wielding the material
      component appears to make these attacks.  The symbol attacks any
      non-attuned creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from the
      symbol. However, when the symbol first attacks a creature, the symbol must
      overcome that creature's spell resistance or be rendered unable to harm
      it. The symbol never again attacks such creatures. Further, when the
      symbol first attacks a creature, a successful Will saving throw allows the
      creature to see the shadow nature of the attacks and take half damage when
      such attacks hit. <i>Symbol of Striking</i> can be made permanent with a
      <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost
      of 10,000 gp.</p>
