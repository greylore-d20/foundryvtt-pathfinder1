      <p>Typically worn by jailers or executioners, this outfit includes a black
      woolen shirt, a tunic, pants, a belt, sturdy boots, a balaclava or hood,
      and a great cloak. This outfit is generally too intimidating and macabre
      to be worn in polite company.</p>

      <p>Some executioner's outfits prominently bear the symbol of the
      government or law-enforcing institution the wearer serves, while others
      are left ragged and stained to appear all the more threatening.</p>
