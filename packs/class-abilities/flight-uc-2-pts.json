      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements: </strong>Summoner level 5th.</p>\n<p>The eidolon grows large wings, like those of a bat, bird, insect, or dragon, gaining the ability to fly. The eidolon gains a fly speed equal to its base speed. The eidolonâ€™s maneuverability depends on its size. Medium or smaller eidolons have good maneuverability. Large eidolons have average maneuverability, while Huge eidolons have poor maneuverability.</p>\n<p>For 2 additional evolution points, the eidolon flies by means of magic. It loses its wings, but its maneuverability increases to perfect. If the eidolon flies by magic, this is a supernatural ability.</p>\n<p>The eidolon can increase its fly speed by spending additional evolution points, gaining a 20-foot increase to its fly speed for each additional point spent.&nbsp;</p>"
