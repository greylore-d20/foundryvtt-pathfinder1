      <p>The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites
      when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is
      much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying
      glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a <em>standard
      action</em> (rather than a <em>full-round action</em>), and lighting any
      other fire with one is at least a <em>standard action</em>.</p>
