  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You make yourself-including clothing, armor, weapons, and
      equipment-appear translucent like a ghost. Any mundane or magical disguise
      on you is affected by this illusion as well; for example, if you are
      disguised as the king or a sahuagin, you look like a ghostly version of
      the king or a sahuagin. Your ghostly form may have a pale green, blue, or
      violet coloration, or a muted version of your normal appearance.</p><p>The
      spell does not actually make you ghostly or provide any incorporeal
      abilities. If you choose, the illusion can make you appear to float
      slightly above the ground, though you are actually still on the ground. A
      creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it
      as an illusion.</p>
