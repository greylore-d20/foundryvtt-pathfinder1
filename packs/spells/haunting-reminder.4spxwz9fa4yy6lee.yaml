  shortDescription: >-
    <p>As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate check
    to make the target act friendly to you. If you succeed, the target assists
    you normally, but it remains fearful of your retribution even after its
    attitude shifts to unfriendly. If the creature reports your coercion to
    authorities, attacks you, or otherwise acts in a purposeful way that
    threatens you or your objectives (at the GM's discretion), the spell
    triggers, inflicting the creature with the unshakable certainty that you
    will find and punish it. This imposes the shaken condition on the creature
    for 1 day per caster level; during this time, the creature takes a -2
    penalty on saving throws against spells you cast with the fear
    descriptor.</p>
