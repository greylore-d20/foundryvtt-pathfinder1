He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his intent before making his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>), and unless the target makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;(DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wis</a>&nbsp;modifier), it dies. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is negated.</p>"
