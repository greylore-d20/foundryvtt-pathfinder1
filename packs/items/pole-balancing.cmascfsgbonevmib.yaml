      <p>This flexible pole can be anywhere from 15 to 30 feet in length. When
      used properly, it helps you keep your balance when crossing narrow
      walkways. Using a balancing pole grants you a +1 <em>circumstance
      bonus</em> on <em>Acrobatics</em> checks made to traverse a narrow
      surface.</p>

      <p>Poles (of all sorts) are also commonly used to probe for hidden or
      obscured things in nearby spaces, or to trigger location-based traps. If
      you vault with a pole as part of a running jump, you gain a +2
      <em>circumstance bonus</em> on your <em>Acrobatics</em> check (but must
      let go of the pole in the process). A pole can also prop doors open or
      closed, serve as a place to hang a lantern or secure a bound foe, or be
      used as a lever to lift a heavy object up to 5 feet away.</p>
