  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell wreathes you in shadowy energy and damages those that make
      melee attacks against you. Any creature that strikes you with its body or
      a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker
      takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage + 1 point per caster level
      (maximum +15). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this
      effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to
      this damage.</p><p>When an attacker takes damage from the spell, you heal
      a number of hit points equal to 25% of the damage the spell dealt.</p>
