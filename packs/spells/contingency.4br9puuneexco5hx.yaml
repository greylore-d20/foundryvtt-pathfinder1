    value: >-
      <p>You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into
      effect under some condition you dictate when casting
      <i>contingency</i>.</p><p>The <i>contingency</i> spell and the companion
      spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum
      total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer
      than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with
      the companion spell when you cast <i>contingency</i>.</p><p>The spell to
      be brought into effect by the <i>contingency</i> must be one that affects
      your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster
      level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).</p><p>The conditions needed to
      bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general.
      In all cases, the <i>contingency</i> immediately brings into effect the
      companion spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the
      prescribed circumstances occur.</p><p>If complicated or convoluted
      conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<i>contingency</i>
      and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell
      occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you
      want it to.</p><p>You can use only one <i>contingency</i> spell at a time;
      if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.</p>
