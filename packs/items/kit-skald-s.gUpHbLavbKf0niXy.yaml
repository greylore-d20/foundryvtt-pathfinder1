            <p>A typical leather or cloth belt pouch has a leather cord to cinch
            it shut and another to tie it to your belt. It is large enough to
            hold 100–200 coins or two apples.</p>

            skill associated with a musical instrument (keyboard, percussion,

            a typical small instrument you could carry by hand, such as a drum,
            lyre, bell, harp, or flute; larger instruments such as a cello or
            piano are of course larger and more expensive.</p>
