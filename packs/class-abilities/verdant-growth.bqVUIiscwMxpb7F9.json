If you have a bloodrager class feature that also grants you fast healing (such as the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Bloodrager%20Spelleater\">spelleater’s blood of life class feature</a>), you can stack up to half of your fast healing from such abilities with the fast healing gained from this ability, but you cannot do so by an amount that exceeds your Charisma bonus (minimum 0).</p>"
