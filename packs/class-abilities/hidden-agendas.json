      "value": "<p>An investigator learns to obscure his thoughts and endeavors from prying eyes and even intrusive magic. When an investigator uses inspiration while attempting a Bluff check to pass secret messages or attempting a Linguistics check to create forgeries, he can roll his inspiration dice twice and take the higher result. In addition, the investigator can use inspiration when attempting a saving throw against a divination spell or effect without expending a use of inspiration.</p>\n<p>An investigator must be at least 11th level to select this talent.</p>"
