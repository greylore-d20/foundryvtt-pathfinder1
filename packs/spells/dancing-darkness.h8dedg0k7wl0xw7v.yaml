  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create either up to four spheres of darkness that each reduce the
      illumination level by one step within a 20-foot-radius, or one dimly lit,
      vaguely humanoid shape. Each sphere of <i>dancing darkness</i> must stay
      within a 10-foot-radius area of one another but can otherwise move as you
      desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight
      or turning corners, or the like. The darkness can move up to 100 feet per
      round. The effect winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the
      spell's range. <i>Dancing shadows</i> can be made permanent with a
      <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
