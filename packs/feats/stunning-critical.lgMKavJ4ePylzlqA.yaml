      <i>Your critical hits cause opponents to become stunned.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Critical Focus, Staggering Critical, base attack bonus +17.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes stunned for
      1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to staggered for 1d4
      rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack
      bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add
      to the duration.</p>

      <p><b>Special</b></p>

      <p>You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical
      hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.</p>
