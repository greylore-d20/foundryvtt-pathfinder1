    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes you to begin sneezing gouts of fire that can not only
      set creatures ablaze but also drop them flat on their backs.</p><p>Once
      you cast this spell, you must sneeze each round as a standard action-you
      can take no other standard action as long as this spell is in effect, nor
      can you take full-round actions. Each time you sneeze, you produce a
      10-foot-long cone of fire and wind. All creatures caught in this cone take
      2d6 points of fire damage-a successful Reflex save halves this damage. Any
      creature that fails to resist this spell with a Reflex save must
      immediately make a DC 12 Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the blast
      of wind associated with the sneeze.</p>
