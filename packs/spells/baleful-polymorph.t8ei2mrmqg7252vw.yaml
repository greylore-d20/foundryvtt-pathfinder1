      <p>As <i>beast shape III</i>, except that you change the subject into a
      Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would prove
      fatal to the creature, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the
      subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.</p><p>If the spell succeeds, the
      subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the
      creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities,
      loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gains the
      alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
      scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and
      level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such as base
      attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points). It retains any class
      features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary,
      supernatural, or spell-like abilities.</p><p>Any polymorph effects on the
      target are automatically dispelled when a target fails to resist the
      effects of <i>baleful polymorph</i>, and as long as <i>baleful
      polymorph</i> remains in effect, the target cannot use other polymorph
      spells or effects to assume a new form. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures
      are immune to <i>baleful polymorph</i>, and a creature with the
      shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard
      action.</p>
