      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>These heavy leather boots contain a layer of brick dust that protects
      your feet from heat. You gain fire resistance 2 against fire attacks
      directed at or under your feet, such as walking across hot coals. Repeat
      or prolonged exposure to fire damage eventually burns the outer leather of
      the boots, ruining them (typically after about 1d10+20 rounds of
      exposure).</p>
