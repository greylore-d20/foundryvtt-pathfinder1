      <p>You have fine control over your kinetic blast, allowing you to alter
      its path to avoid obstacles. You can trace out any path no more than 120
      feet long for your blast, potentially allowing you to avoid cover (even
      total cover). You can choose a path that leads into squares you cannot
      see.</p>
