  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Half-drow take substantial pains to ensure their enemiesâ€™ defeat. You
      must succeed at a ranged touch attack to place your mark on the victim.
      While the mark remains, you may injure yourself as a standard action,
      dealing a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 plus your Strength
      modifier. The recipient of the mark automatically takes twice the amount
      of damage that you deal to yourself, bypassing any damage reduction,
      immunities, or resistances.</p>
