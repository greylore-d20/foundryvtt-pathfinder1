  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Sometimes Irori smiles on his worshipers, granting them a reprieve from
    physical hunger. This spell magically enhances a handful of simple food,
    imbuing it with enough nutrition to satisfy a Medium or smaller creature for
    a full day. The spell does not create food, and thus will not alone prevent
    someone from starving, but it can extend even limited reserves for lengthy
    periods.</p>
