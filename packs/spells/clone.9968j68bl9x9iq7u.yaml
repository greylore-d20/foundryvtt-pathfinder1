  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original
      individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone,
      creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to
      return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become
      inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature
      has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of
      natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.</p><p>To create the duplicate,
      you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with
      a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original
      creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must
      be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown
      in a laboratory for 2d4 months.</p><p>When the clone is completed, the
      original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead.
      The clone is physically identical to the original and possesses the same
      personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the
      clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including
      its gaining of two permanent negative levels, just as if it had been hit
      by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2
      points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or
      less, it can't be cloned). If the original creature gained permanent
      negative levels since the flesh sample was taken, the clone gains these
      negative levels as well.</p><p>The spell duplicates only the original's
      body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the
      original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the
      resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots if not
      preserved.</p>
