      <h3>Statistics</h3>

      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>A metal cage behind this arrow's point contains flammable material. You
      take a <b>-1 penalty on attack rolls</b> when firing incendiary arrows.
      You can light up to six incendiary arrows as a full-round action (a
      standard action if you use a tindertwig) that provokes attacks of
      opportunity.</p>

      <p>Once lit, the arrow burns for 2 rounds. A lit incendiary arrow deals an
      additional <b>1 point of fire damage</b>. On a critical hit, the target
      must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire.</p>

      <p>Incendiary bolts exist for crossbows.</p>
