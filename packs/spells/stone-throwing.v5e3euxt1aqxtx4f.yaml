      <p>The subject gains the rock throwing and rock catching abilities
      (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 303). It can use these abilities with any
      solid, mostly inflexible object with a hardness of at least 5.  The
      subject can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than its own size. The
      range increment for this attack is 20 feet, and rocks can be hurled a
      maximum of 5 range increments. Damage is based on the size of the
      subject-1d8 points of damage for a Large creature, 1d6 for a Medium
      creature, or 1d4 for a Small creature-plus 1-1/2 times the thrower's
      Strength bonus.  For every size category smaller than Large the subject
      is, it receives a cumulative -5 penalty on Reflex saves to catch rocks (or
      similar projectiles) thrown at it.</p>
