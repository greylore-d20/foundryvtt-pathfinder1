  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The ninja has a slower-than-normal metabolism. She can hold her breath
      for twice as long as normal before needing to make Constitution checks
      (four times her Constitution score). In addition, whenever the ninja is
      poisoned, the time between saving throws (the poison's frequency) is
      doubled. Thus, a poison that has a frequency of “1/round for 6 rounds”
      would instead be “1/2 rounds for 12 rounds.”</p>
