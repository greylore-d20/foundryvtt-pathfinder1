      <p>Your chanting grants protection against your enemies. As a move action,
      you can begin chanting to gain the benefit of a protection spell (such as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.skgjjub1hng29nwo]{Protection From Evil}) using your
      oracle level as your caster level. This protection lasts until you stop
      chanting or for the spellâ€™s normal duration, whichever comes first.
      Chanting after the initial round of the effect is a free action, and you
      can incorporate verbal components and communication into the chant;
      magical silence ends a chant and its protection effect.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, you can chant aloud to create a magic circle effect (such
      as @Compendium[pf1.spells.1i8b1v3dngkxj6jp]{Magic Circle against
      Evil}).</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Charisma modifier.</p>
