      "value": "<p><em>A marshal spirit is a towering presence and an inspiration to others.</em><br><br><strong>Spirit Bonus: </strong>When you channel a marshal, your spirit bonus applies on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks, as well as on spirit surge rolls. This allows the bonus to apply twice to the total result if you use a spirit surge on a Charisma check or on a Charisma-based skill check.</p>\n<p><strong>Seance Boon:</strong> Choose a seance boon from any of the other legends to benefit from. When using the shared seance class feature, each participant can choose a different boon.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations: </strong>Council rooms, stages, theaters, throne rooms.</p>\n<p><strong>Influence Penalty: </strong>The time you spend concentrating on your allies prevents you from attending to other important matters. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks. Additionally, if you are not at least nominally in charge of your present allies, you lose the marshal’s spirit bonus and seance boon.</p>\n<p><strong>Taboos: </strong>Choose one: you may not allow yourself or your allies to prevent a fleeing enemy from escaping, since an at-large villain makes a better tale (this applies only to enemies seeking to escape, not to those retreating to alert others or fight again from a better position); you may never leave an ally behind or allow yourself or your allies to sacrifice another ally, even a summoned creature; you must embrace any opportunity to spread the legend of yourself and your allies, even when a low profile would be helpful.</p>"
