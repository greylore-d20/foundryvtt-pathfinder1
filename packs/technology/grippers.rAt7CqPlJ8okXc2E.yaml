  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Grippers are powerful, long-handled tools that resemble a blacksmith's
      tongs. Once they're set, they can be locked into place to grip an object.
      Used when attempting to pry open a stuck object (in a manner similar to
      the use of a crowbar), grippers grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength
      checks. When used to attach two devices, a set of grippers holds on with
      an effective Strength score of 24. Applying grippers to a creature and
      then locking the grippers to crush flesh and bone is a standard action
      that provokes an attack of opportunity and also requires a successful
      melee attack with an improvised weapon. Once locked, the grippers deal
      1d4+7 points of damage.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong>
