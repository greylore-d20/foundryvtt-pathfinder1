      <p>You respond to an attack by briefly becoming vaporous and
      insubstantial, allowing the attack to pass harmlessly through you. You
      gain DR 10/magic against this attack and are immune to any poison, sneak
      attacks, or critical hit effect from that attack.  You cannot use <i>windy
      escape</i> against an attack of opportunity you provoked by casting a
      spell, using a spell-like ability, or using any other magical ability that
      provokes an attack of opportunity when used.</p>
