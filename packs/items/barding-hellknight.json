      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Price</b> varies; <b>Weight</b> varies</p>\r\n<p>Hellknights often equip their steeds with armor similar to their own. Typical <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear#TOC-Barding\">barding</a> for Hellknight steeds features ornamental spikes (these spikes deal no damage). Such <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear#TOC-Barding\">barding</a> is usually designed to look similar to the armor of the horse's rider, or to look skeletal, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fiendish\">fiendish</a>, or similar to a <a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nightmare\">nightmare</a>. Hellknight <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear#TOC-Barding\">barding</a> can be made from Hellknight leather, Hellknight half-plate, or Hellknight plate; it costs four times as much and weighs twice as much. Hellknight half-plate <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear#TOC-Barding\">barding</a> or Hellknight plate <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear#TOC-Barding\">barding</a> slows a mount's speed from 40 feet to 30 feet, from 50 feet to 35 feet, or from 60 feet to 40 feet. A mount wearing such armor moves at only triple its normal speed when running instead of quadruple.</p>\r\n\r\n"
