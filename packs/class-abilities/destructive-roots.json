      "value": "<p>You can root yourself to your current spot and cause the world around you to fall apart. As a standard action, you can cause the ground in a 5-foot radius burst centered on you to crumble and rupture, becoming difficult terrain. As a move action on subsequent rounds, you can continue to concentrate on this area as though concentrating on a spell; doing so increases the radius of difficult terrain by 5 feet (maximum 30-foot-radius). You immediately cease concentrating if you move from the square you started in when you activated this ability. Difficult terrain created by this ability remains for 24 hours before returning to its original state.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
