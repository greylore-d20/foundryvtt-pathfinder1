      "value": "<p>The vigilante gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.qYv70Ch9RQfi1LQQ]{Improved Shield Bash} as a bonus feat. If he already has the Improved Shield Bash feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he chose Improved Shield Bash.</p>\n<p>In addition, if he is at least 6th level, he is treated as if he has the @Compendium[pf1.feats.Ee7JHADKEK37tTHs]{Two-Weapon Fighting} feat as long as one of the weapons used is a shield. This allows him to take feats that require Two-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite without meeting the Two-Weapon Fighting or Dexterity prerequisites, but these feats only apply while he is wielding a shield as one of his weapons (unless he takes Two-Weapon Fighting as normal, in which case this restriction is lifted).</p>"
