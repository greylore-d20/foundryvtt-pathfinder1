    "shortDescription": "<p>By touching a living target, you cause a half-formed, parasitic clone of the target to burst from its midsection. The twin dangles from the target's body, making it difficult for the target to move easily and imparting a -2 penalty on Acrobatics and Climb checks. In addition, for the spell's duration, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn each round, or else it takes 1 point of Constitution damage and is sickened for that round as the twin siphons off its blood. Each time the target receives any healing (magical or otherwise), the duration of this spell is extended by 1 round. Each attack that deals damage to the target reduces the duration of this spell by 1 round. If the duration reaches 0 rounds in this  manner, the twin is violently excised from the body, and the target takes 1d6 points of bleed damage (which can be healed as normal).  The effect of <i>sebaceous twin</i> counts as a disease effect with a DC equal to the spell's saving throw DC.</p>"
