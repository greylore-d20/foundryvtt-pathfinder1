    value: >-
      <i>You can increase the power of your spells, causing them to deal more
      damage.</i><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: All variable, numeric effects of
      an empowered spell are increased by half, including bonuses to those dice
      rolls.</p><p>Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are
      spells without random variables. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot
      two levels higher than the spellâ€™s actual level.</p>
