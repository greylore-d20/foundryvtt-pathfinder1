      "value": "<p>A bard of 20th level or higher can use his performance to cause one enemy to die from joy or sorrow. To be affected, the target must be able to see and hear the bard perform for 1 full round and be within 30 feet. The target receives a <em>Will</em> save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s <em>Cha</em> modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the target is <em>staggered</em> for 1d4 rounds, and the bard cannot use deadly performance on that creature again for 24 hours. If a creature’s saving throw fails, it dies. Deadly performance is a mind-effecting death effect that relies on audible and visual components.</p>"
