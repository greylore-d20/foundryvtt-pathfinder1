      "value": "<p>Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a <em>horse</em> or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on <b>Table: Armor and Shields</b>.</p>\n<p>Armor for a horse (a Large non-<em>humanoid</em> creature) costs four times as much as <em>human</em> armor (a Medium <em>humanoid</em> creature) and also weighs twice as much (see <b>Table: Armor for Unusual Creatures)</b>. If the barding is for a <em>pony</em> or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a <em>humanoid</em>. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.</p>\n<p>Flying mounts can't fly in medium or heavy barding.</p>\n<p>Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on <b>Table: Donning Armor</b>. A barded <em>animal</em> cannot be used to carry any load other than a rider and normal saddlebags.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Barding</th>\n<th colspan=\"3\">Movement Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>(40 ft)</th>\n<th>(50 ft.)</th>\n<th>(60 ft.)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>30 ft.</td>\n<td>35 ft.</td>\n<td>40 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heavy</td>\n<td>30 ft.*</td>\n<td>35 ft.*</td>\n<td>40 ft.*</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
