      <p>The traditional form of this tribal weapon is a short blade bound to
      the skull of a large horned lizard, but a skilled smith can craft one
      entirely out of metal. A traditional klar counts as a light wooden shield
      with armor spikes; a metal klar counts as a light steel shield with armor
      spikes.</p>
