  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can create a 5-foot-radius cloud of smoke.
      This power has a range of 30 feet. Creatures inside the cloud take a â€“2
      penalty on attack rolls and Perception skill checks for as long as they
      remain inside and for 1 round after exiting the cloud. Creatures inside
      the cloud gain concealment from attacks made by opponents that are not
      adjacent to them. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
      to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Fire Bolt power of the Fire Domain.</p>
