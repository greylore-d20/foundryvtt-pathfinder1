  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral
    creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected.</p><p>The
    spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each
    evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum
    10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A
    successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded
    effect.</p><p>The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither
    good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that
    damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will
    save.</p>
