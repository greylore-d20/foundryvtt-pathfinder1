      <p>The shaman gains electricity resistance 10. In addition, as a standard
      action she can unleash a 20- foot line of sparks from her fingertips,
      dealing 1d4 points of electricity damage per shaman level she possesses. A
      successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait
      1d4 rounds between each use.</p>
