  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, you mix special tattoo inks into a potion of
      your choice. Once you finish casting <i>tattoo potion</i>, the potion
      begins bubbling and fizzing-if no one drinks the potion within 1 minute of
      the spell being cast, the potion bubbles away into vapor and is
      destroyed.</p><p>When a potion under the effects of <i>tattoo potion</i>
      is imbibed, the effects of the potion do not occur. Instead, the potion
      transforms into a <i>spell tattoo</i> (see page 16) on the drinker's chest
      tattoo slot-if the drinker already has a magic tattoo in this location,
      the <i>tattoo potion</i> is wasted. Once the potion transforms into a
      <i>spell tattoo</i>, it remains in place permanently until it is used as a
      <i>spell tattoo</i>.</p>
