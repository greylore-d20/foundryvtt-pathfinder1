    value: >-
      <p>This bubbling purple gel eats through adhesives. Each vial can cover a
      single 5-foot square. It destroys most normal adhesives (such as tar, tree
      sap, or glue) in a single round but takes 1d4+1 rounds to deal with more
      powerful adhesives (alchemical glue, tanglefoot bags, spider webbing, and
      so on). It has no affect on fully magical adhesives, such as sovereign
      glue.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC
