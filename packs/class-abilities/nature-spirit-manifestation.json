      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\">Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of nature. Once per day, she can surround herself with an organic cocoon of silk as a full-round action. While enclosed in the cocoon, she’s considered helpless. Eight hours later, she emerges, having changed her type to plant, animal, or humanoid, and having gained superficial physical characteristics of the chosen type as appropriate (see&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). She must choose a type that is different from her current type. This effect change doesn’t alter her Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill ranks, class skills, or proficiencies. The effect is permanent, until the shaman chooses to transform again. Each time the transformation is made, the shaman is cleansed of all poisons or diseases, restored to full hit points, and healed of all ability damage.</span></p>"
