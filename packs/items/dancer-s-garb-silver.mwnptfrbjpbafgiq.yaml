      <p>In addition to granting the same bonus on <em>Perform</em> (dance)
      checks as regular dancer's garb, silver dancer's garb is considered a
      silver instrument for silver balladeer <em>bards</em>.</p>

      <p>Silver dancer's garb can be made of sunsilver (see below); sunsilver
      dancer's garb costs an additional 3,000 gp and grants the same benefits as
      armor made of sunsilver. As with the bonus on <em>Perform</em> (dance)
      checks, this benefit functions only when no other armor or concealing
      clothing is worn.</p>
