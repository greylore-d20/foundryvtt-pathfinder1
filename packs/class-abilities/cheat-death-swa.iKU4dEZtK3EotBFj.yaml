  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 19th level, whenever the swashbuckler is reduced to 0 hit points or
      fewer, she can spend all of her remaining panache to instead be reduced to
      1 hit point. She must have at least 1 panache point to spend. Effects that
      kill the swashbuckler outright without dealing hit point damage are not
      affected by this ability.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges
      to <em>Panache</em> class feature</p>
