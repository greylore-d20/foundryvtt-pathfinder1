      <p>This small, latched wooden case contains numerous tools and devices
      used in hunting and slaying <em>vampires</em>. It contains 10 cloves of
      garlic, four masterwork wooden stakes, a hammer, a silvered mirror, 4
      vials of holy water, 1 application of silversheen, and a masterwork holy
      symbol. It also contains numerous regents and powders used for treating
      wounds and making wards, salves, and other concoctions. In addition to its
      general usefulness, when displayed, a vampire slayer's kit grants its
      owner a +2 bonus on all <em>Charisma</em>-based skill checks made to
      investigate or seek out vampires.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as
            if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash
            weapon.<br /><br />Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a
            range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the
            body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal
            creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto
            the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy
            water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch
            attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br /><br />A
            direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an
            undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5
            feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from
            the splash.<br /><br />Temples to good deities sell holy water at
            cost (making no profit). Holy water is made using the bless water
            spell.</p>

            <p>A holy symbol focuses positive energy and is used by good clerics
            and paladins (or by neutral clerics who want to cast good spells or
            channel positive energy). Each religion has its own holy symbol. The
            material used to make the holy symbol has no effect on its powers,
            though a religion may place special significance on a particular
            material.<br><br>Unholy Symbols: An unholy symbol is like a holy
            symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil
            clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or
            channel negative energy).</p>
