  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A witch with the vision hex can grant a glimpse of the future to a
      creature touched.</p><p>Granting a vision takes 1 minute, during which
      time the witch and the target must remain in contact with one another. At
      the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of the future,
      usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision, subject to GM
      discretion. This is only one possible version of the future, making such
      visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment
      of the witch that granted them. For example, the visions granted by a
      chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and destruction, while those
      of a neutral good witch tend to be of joyous events or occasions. A
      creature cannot be subject to another vision until the current vision has
      either come to pass or been prevented.</p><p>A witch cannot use this
      ability on herself.</p><p>Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to
      negate the vision.</p>
