  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you touch the poison vial against the target creature and cast
      this spell, the vial drains and the target's teeth become envenomed with
      the same poison. The creature gains the use of 1 dose of the poison for
      every 5 caster levels you possess (maximum 4 doses). The creature gains
      immunity to that poison while this spell is in effect. The poison retains
      its normal properties, and this spell does not alter the DC to resist or
      cure the poison.  Each successful bite attack counts as an expended dose.
      When all the poison is used, the spell ends. If the target creature
      doesn't have a bite attack, or if the target's bite attack is already
      poisonous, the spell has no effect. If the target has multiple heads, the
      spell affects only one bite attack.  When this spell ends, any unused
      poison is harmlessly expelled from the target's mouth and cannot be used
      again.</p>
