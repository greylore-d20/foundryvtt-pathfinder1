  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon becomes attuned to vibrations in the ground, gaining
      tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet. This works like the blindsense
      evolution, but only if both the eidolon and the creature to be pinpointed
      are in contact with the ground.</p>

      <p>The summoner must be at least 7th level before selecting this
      evolution.</p>
