    value: >-
      <p>The target's tail moves and acts more quickly, almost with a mind of
      its own. When making a full-attack action, the target may use its tail to
      make a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver as a swift action. For the
      purpose of this attack, the target's tail is a natural weapon with a reach
      of 5 feet. This spell has no effect on creatures lacking a prehensile
      tail. If the target already has an extra attack from <i>haste</i> or a
      similar effect, this spell only allows the tail to make dirty trick and
      steal combat maneuvers, but does not grant an extra attack.</p>
