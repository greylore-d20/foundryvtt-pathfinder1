      of the six more common beam rifle types. Beam cannons are generally
      referred to by type as summarized below. In addition to the standard
      automatic firing mode options (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology
      Guide</em> 20), a beam cannon can be used to launch a devastating blast of
      energy. This is a full-round action, and these blasts can't be used to
      make iterative attacks. When a beam cannon is used to launch a blast, no
      attack roll is made-you simply target a 20-foot-radius spread within a
      maximum range of 300 feet. You must have line of effect to your target
      when you launch a blast; if the blast impacts a solid object before
      reaching the target area, it explodes at that point. All creatures caught
      in the blast radius take 6d6 points of damage of the energy type
      appropriate to the cannon (Reflex DC 14 half). Each blast also has an
      additional effect as determined by the type of cannon. Firing a blast from
      a beam cannon consumes 10 charges.</p><p><strong>Zero Cannon</strong>: A
      zero cannon deals cold damage. A creature that is critically hit by a zero
      cannon or fails its saving throw against the cannon's blast must succeed
      at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or become staggered for 1 round. A zero
      cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of
      31.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 31;
