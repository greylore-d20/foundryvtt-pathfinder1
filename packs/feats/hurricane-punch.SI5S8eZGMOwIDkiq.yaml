      <p><b>Source</b> Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 19</p><p><em>Your fast
      strikes hit with the force of a hurricane, pushing your foes
      away.</em></p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Str 13, Improved Bull Rush,
      Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you hit
      the same creature with unarmed strikes at least twice in the same round,
      you can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that creature as a
      swift action. You can also move with the target even if you have no
      movement remaining, but the distance you move canâ€™t exceed half your
      speed.</p>
