      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This simple fiber or leather cord has a knot
      at either end. One end is wound once around the notch of a throwing arrow
      (see New Ammunition, below). The cord runs taut along the shaft to the
      front of the arrow, where you hold the arrow to throw. The remainder of
      the cord wraps around your hand. The cord dramatically increases the
      throwing arrow's range. Attaching the cord to a throwing arrow is a move
      action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. The
      Rapid Reload feat can be taken for throwing arrow cords, allowing you to
      load a throwing arrow as a free action.</p>
