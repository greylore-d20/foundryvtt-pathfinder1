At 11th level, as a standard action, you can focus on a specific object or area (the size of which can be no greater than a 10-foot-by-10-foot square) and see it as though with&nbsp;true seeing&nbsp;as long as the moon is shining on it. Moonless nights, cloudy skies, and shadows interfere with this ability.</p>"
