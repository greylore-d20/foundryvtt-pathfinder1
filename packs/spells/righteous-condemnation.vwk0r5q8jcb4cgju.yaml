      <p>Any creature of chaotic, neutral, or evil alignment who targets you
      with a spell must succeed at a Will save or take a -4 penalty on
      Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks for the spell's
      duration. Creatures with only neutral alignment components receive a +4
      bonus on their Will saves against this spell. The penalties for alignment
      components stack (therefore, a chaotic evil spellcaster would take a -8
      penalty).</p>
