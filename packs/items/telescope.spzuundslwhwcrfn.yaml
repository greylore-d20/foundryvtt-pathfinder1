      <p>This basic, semi-portable telescope allows the user to see greater
      detail on very distant objects. Telescopes can be built to a variety of
      specifications, but those most often used by adventuring stargazers are
      listed here. A telescope grants the listed <em>circumstance bonus</em>
      (+2, +4, or +6) on <em>Perception</em> checks (see table above) to discern
      celestial bodies and on <em>Knowledge</em> (geography) checks to learn
      about the planets when used at night.</p>

      <p>A telescope can be used to look at either terrestrial or celestial
      objects. Distance penalties on <em>Perception</em> checks for viewing
      objects through the telescope are divided by the telescope's
      magnification. Assembling, disassembling, or significantly moving a
      telescope takes 1 minute.</p>
