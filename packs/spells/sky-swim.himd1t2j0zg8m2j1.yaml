  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell grants the target the ability to swim through the
    air.</p><p>If the target has a swim speed, it can move through the air at
    that speed. Otherwise, it must succeed at Swim checks to move as normal.
    Still air is treated as calm water, light or moderate wind is treated as
    rough water, strong or severe wind is treated as stormy water, and the
    target cannot swim through stronger winds (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 439). This
    spell does not grant the ability to breathe air to creatures that normally
    can't.</p>
