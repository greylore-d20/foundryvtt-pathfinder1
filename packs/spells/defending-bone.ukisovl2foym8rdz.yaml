      <p>You animate a bone with necromantic energy, giving it the power to
      float near your body and interpose itself against physical attacks. This
      gives you damage reduction 5/bludgeoning.</p><p>Once the bone has
      prevented a total of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50
      points), it is destroyed and the spell is discharged. This spell has no
      effect if you have damage reduction from another source.</p>
