  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to age rapidly, empowering
      the witch in the process. The target ages to the next age category (adult
      to middle-aged, and so on). The witch gains a number of temporary hit
      points equal to 1d10 + her witch level and a +2 enhancement bonus to
      either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for a number of hours equal to
      her Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p>These effects last for a number of hours equal to the witchâ€™s level. A
      creature cannot be aged past venerable age by this hex, and it can attempt
      a Fortitude save to negate the effect altogether.</p>

      <p>Once a creature has successfully saved against the withering hex, it
      cannot be affected by it again.</p>
