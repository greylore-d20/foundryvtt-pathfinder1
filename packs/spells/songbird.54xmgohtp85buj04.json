If you cast <i>songbird</i> during the same round in which you attempt a Perform check, <i>songbird</i> acts as accompaniment and grants a +3 bonus on that Perform check.  If you cast <i>songbird</i> in the same round in which you activate a bardic performance, that round of bardic performance does not count against your total rounds of bardic performance available for the day.  If you cast <i>songbird</i> in the same round in which you cast a spell with the sonic descriptor, that spell's save DC increases by 1.</p>"
