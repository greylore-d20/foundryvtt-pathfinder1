  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist’s bomb duplicates the
      effects of @Compendium[pf1.spells.ppeb97nxg1rmdpme]{Contagion} instead of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud}, filling an area equal
      to twice the bomb’s splash area for 1 round per level. An alchemist must
      be at least 8th level and must have the smoke bomb discovery before
      selecting this discovery.</p>
