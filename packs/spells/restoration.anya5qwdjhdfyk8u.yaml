      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.fxz69pwpqt9b6uss]{lesser restoration},
      except that it also dispels temporary negative levels or one permanent
      negative level. If this spell is used to dispel a permanent negative
      level, it has a material component of diamond dust worth 1,000 gp. This
      spell cannot be used to dispel more than one permanent negative level
      possessed by a target in a 1-week period.</p><p><em>Restoration</em> cures
      all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently
      drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is
      drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the
      target.</p>
