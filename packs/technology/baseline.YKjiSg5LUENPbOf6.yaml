  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An injection of baseline floods the brain with neuroinhibitors that
      purge the mind of excess emotion. Baseline has an onset time of 10
      minutes. When it takes effect, baseline renders the recipient immune to
      insanity, mind-affecting effects, and morale bonuses for 1 hour, as well
      as suppressing (but not removing) any such active, ongoing effects. It can
      be resisted with a successful DC 14 Fortitude saving throw. Once a
      creature has been affected by baseline, it cannot be affected by
      additional doses for 24
      hours.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 26;
