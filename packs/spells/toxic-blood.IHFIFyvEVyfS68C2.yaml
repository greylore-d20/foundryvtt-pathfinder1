  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target creature’s blood becomes poisonous. Anytime the target takes
    piercing or slashing damage, a spray of acidic blood spurts from its body in
    the direction of the opponent who inflicted the wound. This blood travels in
    a 10-foot line, striking the first creature or object it touches. A creature
    struck by the blood is exposed to black adder venom and must save against
    the poison as normal, with a DC equal to the spell’s DC.</p><p><em>Toxic
    blood</em> can be made permanent with a
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.nsxngq65mbrzgwnm]{permanency} spell cast by a caster
    of 11th level or higher, at a cost of 7,500 gp.</p>
