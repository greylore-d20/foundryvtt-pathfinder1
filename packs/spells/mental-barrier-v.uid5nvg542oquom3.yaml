      <p>This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.3bw76h8kazudq45e]{mental barrier III},
      but if you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 50%
      chance that the additional damage is negated (as <em>moderate
      fortification</em>). This does not stack with similar effects that negate
      the additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition,
      you are immune to <em>mind thrust I</em>, <em>II</em>, and <em>III</em>,
      and you take half damage from <em>mind thrust IV</em>, <em>V</em>, and
      <em>VI</em> (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell
      can be undercast.</p>
