The British military produced the Lawrence 1917, which found its way into the hands of Russia's soldiers. The device consists of a cumbersome backpack of two tanks and a swivelmounted, handheld projection unit, or \"lance.\" When the device is aimed and a small hand lever depressed, a small gas burner ignites the oil, which is propelled forth in a blazing stream of intense flame. A flamethrower with full tanks is capable of unleashing up to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect.</p>\n<p>When using a flamethrower, the wielder projects a 60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a separate attack roll against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital Strike}. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the <em>blur</em>, <em>invisibility</em>, or <em>mirror image</em> spells, do not foil this line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical hit, the wielder confirms the critical for that roll alone.</p>\n<p>All affected creatures take 4d6 points of damage, and any creature hit by the flaming stream must also succeed at succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or catch fire, taking an additional 2d6 points of damage each round until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action, and dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +2 bonus on this save.</p>\n<p>The device's tanks and backpacks are awkward, and the wielder takes a -4 armor check penalty when wearing the cumbersome device. In addition, the tanks have hardness 10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured in the presence of any adjacent flame (including the device's own gas igniter), a mighty conflagration erupts, the wielder takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and all creatures within a 20-foot radius take 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 for half ). Any creatures who take damage must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or catch on fire.</p>"
