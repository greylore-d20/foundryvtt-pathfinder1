      <p>The alchemist can create bombs that devour living matter. The
      alchemist’s bomb deals damage one die step higher than normal (regular
      bombs deal d8s, concussive bombs deal 1d6, and so on), but they have no
      effect on inorganic matter. In addition, a creature with at least a +1
      armor bonus to AC is less likely to be harmed; such creatures in the
      bomb’s splash radius take no damage on a successful Reflex save, and the
      target of a direct hit can attempt a Reflex save against the bomb’s save
      DC to take only half damage.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link
