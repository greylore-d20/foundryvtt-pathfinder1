  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, the warpriest can channel an aspect of war, growing in
      power and martial ability. Once per day as a swift action, a warpriest can
      treat his level as his base attack bonus, gains DR 10/-, and can move at
      his full speed regardless of the armor he is wearing or his encumbrance.
      In addition, the blessings he calls upon donâ€™t count against his daily
      limit during this time. This ability lasts for 1 minute.</p>
