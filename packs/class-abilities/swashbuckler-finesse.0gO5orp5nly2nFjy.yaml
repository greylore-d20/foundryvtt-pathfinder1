    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, a swashbuckler gains the benefits of the Weapon Finesse
      feat with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, and she can use her
      Charisma score in place of Intelligence as a prerequisite for combat
      feats. This ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for purposes
      of meeting feat prerequisites.</p>
