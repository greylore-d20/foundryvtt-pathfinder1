  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can see magical auras. If she expends 1 point from her
      arcane reservoir, for 1 minute she instantly recognizes magic item auras
      and spell effects (as @Compendium[pf1.spells.uqh87jz757r2cb7r]{Detect
      Magic}). During this time, she is treated as if she had studied each aura
      for 3 rounds and she treats her Knowledge (arcana) skill check as if she
      had rolled a 15 on the d20. In addition, if she touches a magic item
      during this time, she can immediately identify its properties using
      Spellcraft without needing to spend 3 rounds examining the object. If an
      enemy possesses the object, the arcanist must first succeed at a melee
      touch attack to identify the item.</p>
