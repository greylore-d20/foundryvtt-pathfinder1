  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain @Compendium[pf1.spells.68m9du7zw2di7ew6]{Feather Fall} as a
      spell-like ability, which you can use a number of rounds per day equal to
      your oracle level. The rounds do not need to be used consecutively. If you
      are in mid fall when this abilityâ€™s duration expires, you take falling
      damage as if you fell from the altitude you were at when the spell
      ended.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, you can also apply your daily rounds of this ability to
      use @Compendium[pf1.spells.e4v1uv8hexeu9sxj]{Air Walk}.</p>
