      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 300 gp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>\r\n<p>This soothing elixir was created to counter the energy-draining effects of <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/vampire\">vampires</a>, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/wight\">wights</a>, and similar horrible creatures. If you have a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels\">negative level</a> (whether temporary or permanent), you can drink a dose of soul stimulant, negating the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels\">negative level's</a> penalty for 12 hours. You can only benefit from 1 dose of soul stimulant at a time, though you can continue to take a dose every 12 hours to stave off the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels\">negative level's</a> effects.</p>\r\n"
