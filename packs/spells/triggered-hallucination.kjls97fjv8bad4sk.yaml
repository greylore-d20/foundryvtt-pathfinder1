      <p>This spell functions as <i>audiovisual hallucination</i> (see page
      204), except that this spell's phantasm has no apparent effect until a
      specific condition occurs. You must overcome the target's spell resistance
      to plant the <i>triggered hallucination</i>, but the target doesn't
      attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition occurs
      (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with <i>audiovisual
      hallucination</i>). The phantasm can include auditory, olfactory, visual,
      tactile, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.  You set the
      triggering condition (such as hearing a certain word or seeing a type of
      creature) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can
      be as general or detailed as desired but must be based on an audible,
      tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger can't be based on any
      quality not  normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment.
      <i>Triggered hallucination</i> uses the target's senses to notice
      triggers.</p>
