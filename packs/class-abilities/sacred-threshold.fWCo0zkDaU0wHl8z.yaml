  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can bless a door, a window, or another portal
      with a touch. For 1 minute, you can increase or decrease the DC of any
      check to unlock or force open the portal by an amount equal to half your
      cleric level. In addition, your first ally to pass through the portal
      during this time gains an amount of temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + 1
      for every 2 cleric levels you have. These temporary hit points last for 1
      minute. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Agile Feet power of the Travel Domain.</p>
