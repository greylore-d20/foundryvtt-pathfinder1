      Powers</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.2mnWAoFKqKKxWCt4]{Liberation
      (Su)}: You have the ability to ignore impediments to your mobility. For a
      number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level, you can move normally
      regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if you were
      affected by freedom of movement. This effect occurs automatically as soon
      as it applies. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.05dlMQ4G1bTM74xp]{Powerful
      Persuader (Su)}: At 8th level, when you make a Diplomacy or Intimidate
      check, you can roll twice and take the higher result. Using this ability
      is a free action. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus
      one additional time per day for every 2 levels beyond 8th.</p><h3>Domain
