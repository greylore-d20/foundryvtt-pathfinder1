    value: >-
      <p>You can cast this spell only as a response to a confirmed critical hit
      against the target that would deal slashing damage. If the target fails
      the saving throw and has a discernible head, the attack deals an extra 4d6
      points of damage and the critical multiplier of the critical hit increases
      by 1. If the critical hit then brings the target to 0 hit points or fewer,
      the target is instantly decapitated and dies unless it can survive
      decapitation. Even on a successful saving throw, the critical hit deals an
      extra 4d6 points of damage.</p>
