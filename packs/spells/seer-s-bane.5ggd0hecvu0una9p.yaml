  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>nondetection</i>, except that those who cast
    divination spells targeting the warded creature or item must succeed on a
    caster level check (DC = 15 + your caster level). If the caster of the
    divination fails, deadly magical feedback strikes at him, dealing 1d6 points
    of electricity damage per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th
    level).  Alternatively, if you cast <i>bestow curse</i>, <i>chaos
    hammer</i>, <i>contagion</i>, <i>holy smite</i>, order's wrath,
    <i>poison</i>, or <i>unholy blight</i> in the round immediately following
    seer's bane, you can replace the spell's damaging effect with the effects of
    that second spell (the divination's caster-and potentially those around
    him-save as normal for the modifying spell).</p>
