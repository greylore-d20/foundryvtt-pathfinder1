    value: >-
      <p>Traditional thieves’ tools might be suspicious, but no guard looks
      twice at a common deck of cards. So long has the character has access to a
      deck of cards, she can destroy one card to attempt a single Disable Device
      check as if she had a set of thieves tools. If she uses a harrow card for
      this purpose, she can treat the card as a set of masterwork thieves’ tools
      (granting her a +2 circumstance bonus on the Disable Device check), though
      the card is still destroyed after use.</p>
