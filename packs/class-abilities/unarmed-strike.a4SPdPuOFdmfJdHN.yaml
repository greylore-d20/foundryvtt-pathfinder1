      <p>At 1st level, a monk gains
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed Strike} as a
      bonus feat. A monk’s attacks may be with fist, elbows, knees, and feet.
      This means that a monk may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There
      is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk
      may thus apply his full <em>Strength</em> bonus on damage rolls for all
      his unarmed strikes.</p><p>Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal
      damage, but he can choose to deal <em>nonlethal damage</em> instead with
      no penalty on his <em>attack roll</em>. He has the same choice to deal
      lethal or <em>nonlethal damage</em> while <em>grappling</em>.</p><p>A
      monk’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a
      natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or
      improve either manufactured weapons or <em>natural weapons</em>.</p><p>A
      monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person
      would, as shown above on Table: Monk. The unarmed damage values listed on
      <em>Table: Monk</em> are for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage
      than the amount given there with his unarmed attacks, while a Large monk
      deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed
      Damage.</p><hr><table><caption><strong>Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed
