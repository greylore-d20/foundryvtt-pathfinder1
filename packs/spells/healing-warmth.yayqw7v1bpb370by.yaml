  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell grants you temporary immunity to fire damage as <i>protection
    from energy</i>. As a standard action, you may sacrifice 12 points of
    remaining energy absorption from the spell to heal a touched creature of 1d8
    points of damage. Healing a creature provokes an attack of opportunity. When
    the spell has absorbed 12 points of fire damage per caster level (to a
    maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.</p>
