      <p>You store one spell that you can normally cast in a wooden
      quarterstaff. Only one such spell can be stored in a staff at a given
      time, and you cannot have more than one <i>spellstaff</i> at any given
      time. You can cast a spell stored within a staff just as though it were
      among those you had prepared, but it does not count against your normal
      allotment for a given day. You use up any applicable material components
      required to cast the spell when you store it in the <i>spellstaff</i>.</p>
