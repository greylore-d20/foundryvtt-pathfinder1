  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You mark a subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject
      that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject.
      Typically, you designate some sort of undesirable behavior that activates
      the mark, but you can pick any act you please.</p><p>The effect of the
      mark is identical with the effect of <i>bestow curse</i>.</p><p>Since this
      spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can
      cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained.</p><p>Like the
      effect of <i>bestow curse</i>, a <i>mark of justice</i> cannot be
      dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited
      <i>wish</i>, miracle, remove curse, or <i>wish</i> spell. <i>Remove
      curse</i> works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your
      <i>mark of justice</i> caster level. These restrictions apply regardless
      of whether the mark has activated.</p>
