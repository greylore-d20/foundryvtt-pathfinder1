  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can touch a creature as a standard action to suppress its strong
      emotions. The target is affected as the calm emotions spell, except it can
      still take violent actions and violent actions against the target do not
      end the effect. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
      cleric level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number times per day
      equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Icicle power of the Water Domain.</p>
