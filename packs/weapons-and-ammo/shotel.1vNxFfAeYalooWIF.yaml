  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shotel is a downward-curving sword designed to reach over or around
      an opponent's shield. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a shotel
      against opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields. The
      curve of a shotel's blade varies from sword to sword, and some models are
      double-edged, while others are single-edged, with the back edge able to be
      braced against a shield for additional power. Shotels are particularly
      useful for hooking mounted combatants and ripping them from their
      steeds.</p>
