      <p>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its Strength. Once per round
      as a free action, the target can choose to increase the enhancement bonus
      by 2 for 1 round; if it does so, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage
      and the spell's duration decreases by 1 additional round. For every 5
      caster levels you have, the target can choose to increase the enhancement
      bonus by an additional 2, taking an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal
      damage and decreasing the duration by 1 additional round per increase to
      the Strength bonus, to a maximum enhancement bonus of +10 and 4d6 points
      of nonlethal damage at caster level 15th. The subject can't spend more
      rounds than remain in the duration. When the spell ends, the subject
      becomes fatigued.</p>
