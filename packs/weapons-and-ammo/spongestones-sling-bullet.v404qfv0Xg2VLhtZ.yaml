      <h3>Description</h3><p>These bullets are actually made from a porous stone
      or heavy wood that absorbs liquids and shatters on impact. Spongestones
      are often used to deliver poison or burning oil. A flask of oil completely
      saturates 10 spongestones. When ignited (a free action if fire is
      available), a burning, oil-soaked spongestone deals +1d2 fire damage and
      can ignite combustible materials (such as a thatched roof ). Allowing a
      spongestone to burn in a sling's cup for more than 1d3 rounds gives the
      sling the broken condition.</p>
