If multiple types of alchemical items are poured in, all the contents are ruined. The flask can be thrown as a normal <em>splash weapon</em>, and when it breaks, it releases all of the contained <em>splash weapons</em> in the same space, and the <i>focusing flask</i> is destroyed. If the items held within the flask normally allow a saving throw to reduce or negate the effects, the target of a <i>focusing flask</i> needs to succeed at only a single saving throw, regardless of the number of items held within the <i>focusing flask</i>. The DC of the saving throw increases by 2 if the flask contains two alchemical items, or by 4 if it contains three items.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><b>Feats</b> <em>Craft Wondrous Item</em>; <b>Spells</b> <em>shrink item</em>; <b>Cost</b> 350 gp</p>"
