  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses incorporeal form, she
      becomes shrouded in a haze of insubstantial mist, granting her concealment
      against ranged attacks.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the spiritualist can better affect incorporeal creatures
      with melee attacks; her unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks are
      treated as if they had the ghost touch magic weapon special ability.</p>

      <p>At 13th level, the spiritualist can take a standard action to become
      invisible (as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility}
      spell) the start of her next turn.</p>

      <p>At 18th level, the spiritualist gains the incorporeal subtype and a fly
      speed of 30 feet (good) while using this form of bonded manifestation.</p>
