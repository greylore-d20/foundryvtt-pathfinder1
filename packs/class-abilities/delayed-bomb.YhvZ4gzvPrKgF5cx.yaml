  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds
      after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any
      number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds
      equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of
      the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation.
      A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to
      touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial
      (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a
      direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates,
      and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot
      have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed
      bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert.
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic} can neutralize a
      delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the
      alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier).</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
