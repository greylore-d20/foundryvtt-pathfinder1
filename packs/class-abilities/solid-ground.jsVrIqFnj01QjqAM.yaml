  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist launches an explosive paste bomb that bonds with any
      earthen surface. Each application of this paste deals no damage and
      affects a 5-foot-cube of dirt, loose soil, or stone, transmuting the earth
      for a number of minutes equal to the alchemistâ€™s level. Creatures cannot
      use burrow, earthmeld, or similar abilities (such as the meld into stone
      spell) while the ground remains transmuted in this way.</p>
