  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>minor image</i>, except it always creates
      an animated illusion of you presenting to a vampire a material, object, or
      sound that it is averse to, such as garlic, a holy symbol, or bells
      ringing. You specify what aversion the illusion depicts when you cast the
      spell. The vampire reacts to the illusion as if it were real; it can
      overcome the effect by succeeding at a disbelief save or a normal Will
      save against the illusion's DC (instead of the normal DC 25 to overcome
      its revulsion). The illusion is only quasi-real and cannot otherwise
      affect creatures.</p>
