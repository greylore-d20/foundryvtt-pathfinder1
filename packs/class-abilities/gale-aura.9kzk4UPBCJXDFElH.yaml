  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, as a standard action, you can create a 30-foot aura of
      gale-like winds that slows the progress of enemies. Creatures in the aura
      cannot take a 5-foot step. Enemies in the aura treat each square that
      brings them closer to you as difficult terrain. They can move normally in
      any other direction. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per
      day equal to your cleric level. The rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Lightning Lord pwoer of the Weather Domain.</p>
