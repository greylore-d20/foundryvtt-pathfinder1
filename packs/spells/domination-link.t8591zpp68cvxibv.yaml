      <p>This spell functions like <i>detect thoughts</i>, with the additional
      ability to find echoes of the thoughts of a creature mentally controlling
      the target. For example, if the target has been dominated by a vampire,
      you can use evidence left in the target's mind to learn about that
      vampire. Each minute you concentrate on the spell, you can learn your
      choice of one of the following pieces of information. <i>Direction</i>:
      The controller's general direction and distance. <i>Emotion</i>: The
      controller's emotional state (gloating, sated, frightened, angry, and so
      on). <i>Image</i>: A powerful iconic image relevant to the controller or
      its connection to the target, such as a symbol on a door or a name on a
      gravestone. <i>Location</i>: The controller's general location, such as
      "in a large city" or "on a ship." <i>Name</i>: The name by which the
      target knows its controller (if any).  All of this information is based on
      the last time the influencing creature linked itself to the target, either
      to issue a command or to receive sensory input from the target. For
      example, if at nightfall a vampire commanded a dominated victim to walk to
      a cemetery, this spell can reveal the vampire's general location at that
      time, though it may have moved since then.</p>
