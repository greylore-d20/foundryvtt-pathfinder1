That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.<p>You do not need to make Acrobatics skill checks to move at full speed while blinded.<p><strong>Normal</strong><br>Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.<p><strong>Special</strong><br>The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell.<p><strong>Combat Trick</strong><br>Once per round, when you hit a creature that benefits from concealment, you can spend 2 stamina points to ignore the miss chance from that creature's concealment until the end of your next turn.</p>"
