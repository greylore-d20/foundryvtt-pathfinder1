  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You send out a burst of luck with a 30-foot radius centered around you.
      While the <i>Beacon of Luck</i> is in effect, you gain a +2 sacred bonus
      on all saving throws. As an immediate action before a saving throw is
      made, allies within the area can choose to benefit from this luck, rolling
      twice for a saving throw and taking the better result. Once a creature
      benefits from the <i>Beacon of Luck</i> in this way, it cannot gain the
      benefit of this spell for 24 hours.</p>
