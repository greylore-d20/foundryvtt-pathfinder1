  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its
    height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease
    changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. The target
    gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a -2 size penalty to Strength (to a
    minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its
    <i>reduced</i> size.</p><p>A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to
    Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that
    it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid creature
    whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of
    5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's speed.</p><p>All equipment
    worn or carried by a creature is similarly <i>reduced</i> by the
    spell.</p><p>Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical
    properties are not affected by this spell. Any <i>reduced</i> item that
    leaves the <i>reduced</i> creature's possession (including a projectile or
    thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown
    weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size
    of the weapon that fired them).</p><p>Multiple magical effects that reduce
    size do not stack. <i>Reduce person</i> counters and dispels <i>enlarge
    person</i>.</p><p><i>Reduce person</i> can be made permanent with a
    <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
