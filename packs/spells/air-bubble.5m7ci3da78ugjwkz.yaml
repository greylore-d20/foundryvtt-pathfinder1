      <p><i>Air bubble</i> creates a small pocket of breathable air that
      surrounds the touched creature's head or the touched object. The <i>air
      bubble</i> allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar
      airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage.  A
      firearm within an <i>air bubble</i> can be loaded-assuming the black
      powder comes from a powder horn, a cartridge, or some other airtight
      protective device-and fired. When shooting such a firearm underwater, the
      shot still takes the standard -2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet
      of water the bullet passes through, in addition to normal penalties due to
      range. If a firearm within the <i>air bubble</i> explodes, the explosion
      occurs normally.</p>
