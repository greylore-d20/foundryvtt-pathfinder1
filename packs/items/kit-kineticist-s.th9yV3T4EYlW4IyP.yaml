            <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot
            radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional
            20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light
            becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in
            normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it
            as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
            equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire
            damage.</p>

            it. As long as it stays dry, it can go for months without
