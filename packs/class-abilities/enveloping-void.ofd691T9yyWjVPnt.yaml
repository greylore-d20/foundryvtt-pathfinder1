  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman curses one creature with the dark void. As a standard
      action, the shaman can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light
      level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light
      becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become
      supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision
      cannot see). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the
      shamanâ€™s level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the
      target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
