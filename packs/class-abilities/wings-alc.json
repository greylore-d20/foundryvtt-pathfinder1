      "value": "<p>The alchemist gains batlike, birdlike, or insectlike functional wings, allowing him to fly as the&nbsp;fly&nbsp;spell for a number of minutes per day equal to his caster level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. An alchemist can select this discovery multiple times; each time he does so, he adds his caster level to the number of minutes per day that he can fly with the wings. This flight is an extraordinary ability.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
