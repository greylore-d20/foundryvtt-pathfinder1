      <p>You alter an item's aura so that it registers to <i>detect</i> spells
      (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a
      magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify.
      If the object bearing <i>magic aura</i> has <i>identify</i> cast on it or
      is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and
      <i>detect</i>s the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will
      save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals
      what the true magic is.</p><p>If the targeted item's own aura is
      exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), <i>magic
      aura</i> doesn't work.</p><p><i>Note:</i> A magic weapon, shield, or suit
      of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for
      example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.</p>
