  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the investigator becomes flat-footed, he can expend one use of
      inspiration to ignore that condition. He must be conscious to do so, and
      must decide to do so when he becomes flat-footed. Using this ability
      doesnâ€™t require an action.</p>
