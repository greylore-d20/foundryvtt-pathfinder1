The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy’s reach. The subject can move 10 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The distance the subject can move increases by 5 feet for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.</p>\n<p>The subject can’t move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn’t count against the subject’s movement speed for that round.</p>"
