    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, a wind spirit envelopes you and carries you
      with it at your direction. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your
      base speed and fly speed while this spell is in effect. If you don't have
      a fly speed, you instead gain a fly speed of 10 feet with poor
      maneuverability. If your caster level is 10thâ€“14th, the enhancement bonus
      to these speeds is +20 feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 20
      feet with average maneuverability). If your caster level is 15th or
      higher, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +30 feet (if applicable,
      your temporary fly speed is 30 feet with average maneuverability).</p>
