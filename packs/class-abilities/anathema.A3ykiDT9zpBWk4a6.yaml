  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When an investigator creates or prepares a poison, including poisons
      derived from racial or class abilities, he can spend one use of
      inspiration to create an anathema instead. Anathemas count as poisons, but
      they can affect creatures that are normally immune to poison, as they
      exploit vulnerabilities in their very nature rather than their biology.
      When an anathema is created, select a creature type (and subtype, if
      applicable) from the ranger favored enemy list; the anathema functions
      only against this chosen type. The investigator also chooses one of the
      following special abilities for the anathema to affect: damage reduction
      (except DR/—), energy resistance (one type chosen by the investigator),
      fast healing, movement speed, or spell resistance.<p>The method of
      delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) and the DC of the
      anathema’s save are identical to those of the poison used to make the
      anathema. If the target fails its save against the anathema (even if the
      enemy is normally immune to effects that require a specific save, such as
      undead’s immunity to effects that require a Fortitude save), the value of
      the chosen ability is lowered by 5 (minimum 0) for 1 round per
      investigator level.</p>
