      <p><strong>Source</strong> Advanced Class Guide pg. 45</p><p>The shaman
      sees through stone, earth, or sand as easily as if it were transparent
      crystal. Her gaze can penetrate a number of feet equal to her shaman level
      (or 1/12th this thickness of metal). The shaman can use this ability a
      number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do
      not need to be consecutive.</p>
