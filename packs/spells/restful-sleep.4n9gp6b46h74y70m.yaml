      <p>You cast this spell immediately prior to resting. While under the
      effects of this spell, you and your allies enjoy a restful night's sleep.
      If a subject completes a full night's rest, it regains hit points as if it
      had undergone a full day of bed rest (regaining twice its character level
      in hit points). If a subject completes a full day's rest, it regains three
      times its character level in hit points. Any significant interruption
      during the rest (such as being awoken) prevents any healing that night and
      ends the effect of this spell on the awakened subject. Any healing
      acquired while under the effects of <i>restful sleep</i> is considered
      natural healing, and has no affect on effects requiring magical healing to
      cure.</p>
