  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The targets of this spell become angrier as they fight, the pain of their
    wounds fueling their strength. An affected creature gains a cumulative +2
    morale bonus to Strength and a cumulative -1 penalty to AC for every 5
    points of damage it takes (maximum +10 Strength, -5 AC) for the duration of
    the spell. These bonuses last until the spell expires or the target falls
    unconscious.</p>
