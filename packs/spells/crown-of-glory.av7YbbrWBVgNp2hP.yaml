      <p>You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. All creatures with fewer
      than 8 HD are compelled to stop and pay attention to you. Any such
      creature that wants to take hostile action against you must make a Will
      save to do so. Any creature that fails this saving throw the first time it
      attempts a hostile action is enthralled for the duration of the spell (as
      the @Compendium[pf1.spells.v3d3lnjj7ks0ztii]{Enthrall} spell), as long as
      it is in the spell's area. It does not try to leave the area on its own.
      Creatures with 8 HD or more are not affected.</p>

      <p>When you speak, all listeners telepathically understand you. You can
      make up to three suggestions to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as
      if using the @Compendium[pf1.spells.52v3fogun1n9jzum]{Mass Suggestion}
      spell (Will save negates). Only creatures within range at the time of a
      <em>suggestion</em> are subject to it.</p>
