  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>alarm</i>, except that you can tweak the spell
    to be more discerning in what types of creatures or objects trigger the
    <i>alarm</i>. Instead of being triggered whenever a creature of Tiny size or
    larger enters the warded area, you can set whatever triggering conditions
    you wish, as long as they are based on observable phenomenon. For example,
    you could cause the selective <i>alarm</i> to trigger when creatures of a
    certain race (such as orcs, bugbears, or kobolds) enter the area, or
    whenever a group of four or more creatures enters the area together, or when
    a metal object is brought into the area. You can't choose triggering
    conditions that rely on unobservable information, such as having it
    triggered when creatures of a certain alignment enter the area, nor could
    you have the <i>alarm</i> be triggered by "something worth more than 5,000
    gp" entering the area, or even "a weapon" entering the area, because an
    item's value and classification as a weapon is subjective, and might vary
    from one person to the next.</p>
