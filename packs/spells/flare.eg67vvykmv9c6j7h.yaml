  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst in
    front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled for 1 minute unless it
    makes a successful Fortitude save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures
    already dazzled, are not affected by flare.</p>
