  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can give a creature you can see within 60 feet one chance to avoid
      an eternity of suffering by ordering it to carry out any one simple action
      that would take no more than 1 round to complete. Good and neutral
      creatures that refuse become shaken for 1 round (Will negates), while evil
      creatures that obey gain a +2 morale bonus on all rolls and checks made
      for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3
      + your Wisdom modifier. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting
      effect.</p>
