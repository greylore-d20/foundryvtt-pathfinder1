      <p>You place a curse upon a dead creature that bars its spirit from
      returning. Anyone casting a spell that would communicate with the dead
      creature, return it to life, or turn it into an undead creature must
      succeed on a caster level check with a DC of 11 plus your caster level.
      <i>Rest eternal</i> cannot be dispelled, but it can be negated with
      <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break enchantment</i>.</p>
