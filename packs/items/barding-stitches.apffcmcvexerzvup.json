Equipping a creature with barding using barding stitches takes 10 times as long as normal barding, and a successful DC 25 <em>Heal</em> check is required to <em>attach</em> or remove the stitches. The creature must be <em>helpless</em> or willing to be equipped with barding stitches, and must have at least a +1 <em>natural armor bonus</em> to AC. An armored creature with barding stitches takes a -2 penalty on <em>Strength</em>&#8211; and <em>Dexterity</em>-based skill checks (in addition to any penalties from the barding itself), <em>Fortitude</em> and <em>Reflex</em> saves, and saves against effects with the <em>pain descriptor</em> (these penalties stack). These penalties persist for as long as the creature is equipped with barding stitches.</p>"
