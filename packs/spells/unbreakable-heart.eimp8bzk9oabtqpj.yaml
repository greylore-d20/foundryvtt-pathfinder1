  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target creature gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against
      mind-affecting effects that rely on negative emotions (such as <i>crushing
      despair</i>, <i>rage</i>, or fear effects) or that would force him to harm
      an ally (such as confusion). If the target is already under such an effect
      when receiving this spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of
      this spell. It does not affect mind-affecting effects based on positive
      emotions (such as <i>good hope</i> or the inspire cou<i>rage</i> bard
      ability). A creature can still be charmed or otherwise magically
      controlled while under this spell's effects, but if such a creature ever
      receives a new saving throw against that effect as a result of being
      ordered to attempt to harm or otherwise oppose a true ally, he can roll
      that saving throw twice and take the better result as his actual roll.
