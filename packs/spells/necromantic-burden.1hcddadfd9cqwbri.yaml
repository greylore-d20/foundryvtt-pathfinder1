    value: >-
      <p>You make an undead creature more difficult for necromancers and clerics
      to control via effects such as Command Undead or <i>control undead</i>. If
      the target fails its Will save, the target's effective number of Hit Dice
      is doubled for the purposes of determining whether it remains under the
      control of another creature.</p><p>Regardless of the target's actual Hit
      Dice, its effective HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. (For
      example, a 12th-level cleric could cast this spell to cause an undead
      creature with 15 HD to instead effectively have 24 HD for the purpose of
      controlling it.) If the targeted undead is under the control of another
      creature and this spell causes the target's effective Hit Dice to exceed
      the controller's maximum capability, the target creature is immediately
      freed from control. Any creature capable of controlling undead may attempt
      to control the target, provided the target's effective HD won't cause the
      would-be controller to exceed its HD limit. The target's former controller
      can attempt to regain control over the target by relinquishing command
      over other creatures until its HD limit is no longer exceeded (or the
      former controller can wait until the spell's duration expires to attempt
      this at the target's normal HD).</p>
