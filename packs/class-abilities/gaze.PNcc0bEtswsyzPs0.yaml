      <p>At 1st level, you can harness the power of the medusa through your
      gaze. As a standard action, choose a creature within your line of sight
      who is within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude
      saving throw or have its speed halved for a number of rounds equal to your
      Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). The DC of this save is equal to
      10 + half your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier.</p>
