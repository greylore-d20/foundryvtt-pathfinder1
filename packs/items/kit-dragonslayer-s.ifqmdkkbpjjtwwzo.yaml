      <p>Aimed more at hired blades than seasoned adventurers, this kit provides
      supplemental equipment for outfitting hirelings to hunt dragons. It
      includes a potion of cure moderate wounds, oil of bless weapon (1
      application), a longspear, a <em>backpack</em>, three large sacks, a
      sunrod, a tower shield, and 5 vials of alchemist's fire. For hunting
      dragons that are immune to fire, the alchemist's fire can be replaced with
      acid at the time of purchase, for a savings of 50 gp.</p>
