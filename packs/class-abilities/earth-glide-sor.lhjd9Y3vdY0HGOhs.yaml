  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, you can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone
      as easily as a fish swims through water, with a <em>burrow</em> speed
      equal to half your normal speed. You do not leave a tunnel or trace of
      your passage. You can use this ability for 1 minute per sorcerer level
      each day. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in
      1-minute increments.</p>
