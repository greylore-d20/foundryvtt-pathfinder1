  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to
      wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures are
      affected as well. A magic object made of metal effectively has spell
      resistance equal to 20 + its caster level against this spell. Artifacts
      cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood take a -2
      penalty on attack and damage rolls.</p><p>The armor bonus of any armor
      converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this
      spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor
      changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time
      it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.</p><p>Only <i>limited
      wish, miracle, wish,</i> or similar magic can restore a transmuted object
      to its metallic state.</p>
