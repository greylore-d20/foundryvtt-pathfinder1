      <p>Your eidolon's form shifts and transforms. This spell allows you to
      change any of the eidolon's evolutions by allocating its evolution pool on
      new evolutions. If you have the aspect or greater aspect ability, this
      spell also allows you to change the evolution points spent to modify you,
      including removing or adding points as allowed by those
      abilities.</p><p>Your eidolon cannot benefit from this spell more than
      once per day. This spell does not allow you to change your eidolon's base
