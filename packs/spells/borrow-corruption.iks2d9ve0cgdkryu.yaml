  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You touch a creature with at least one manifestation from a corruption
      (see page 14). You temporarily gain any stains and gifts that corruption
      grants to the creature, and the creature retains them. If the gifts have
      limited uses, you count as having no uses remaining. You take 1d3 points
      of Wisdom drain whenever you cast this spell.  If your campaign uses the
      sanity system (see page 12), your sanity score decreases by 2 (and thus
      your sanity edge decreases by 1) each time you cast this spell, instead of
      you taking Wisdom drain. Only <i>greater restoration</i>, <i>miracle</i>,
      or <i>wish</i> can remove this decrease. A single casting of <i>greater
      restoration</i> removes one decrease of sanity from casting <i>borrow
      corruption</i>, while a casting of <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> removes
      them all.</p>
