    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, a kineticist gains a kinetic blast wild talent of her
      choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches her
      element. Simple blasts are listed with their corresponding
      <em>elements</em>.</p>

      <p>As a <em>standard action</em>, the kineticist can unleash a kinetic
      blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. She must have at least
      one hand free to aim the blast (or one prehensile appendage, if she
      doesn’t have hands). All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic
      for the purpose of bypassing <em>damage reduction</em>. Kinetic blasts
      count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.n250dFlbykAIAg5Z]{Weapon Focus}. The kineticist is
      never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast (regardless
      of effects from form infusions; see Infusion), and she can’t use
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital Strike} feats with kinetic
      blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of
      elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to
      swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms).
      A <em>readied</em> kinetic blast can be used to <em>counterspell</em> any
      spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor. A kinetic blast
      that deals energy damage of any type (including force) has the
      corresponding descriptor.</p>

      <p>Each simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast.</p>

      <p>Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal an amount of damage equal
      to 1d6+1 + the kineticist’s <em>Constitution</em> modifier, increasing by
      1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. Spell resistance doesn’t
      apply against physical blasts.</p>

      <p>Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal an amount of damage
      equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist’s <em>Constitution</em> modifier,
      increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p>

      <p>Composite blasts combine elements to form a new blast. When a
      kineticist gains a new element through <em>expanded element</em>, she
      gains access to all composite blasts for which she qualifies. All
      composite blasts are listed after the <em>kineticist elements</em>.</p>

      <p>Most composite blasts are either physical or energy blasts, like simple
      blasts.</p>

      <p>Physical composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6+2 + the
      kineticist’s <em>Constitution</em> modifier, increasing by 2d6+2 for every
      2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p>

      <p>Energy composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + 1/2 the
      kineticist’s <em>Constitution</em> modifier, increasing by 2d6 for every 2
      kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p>
