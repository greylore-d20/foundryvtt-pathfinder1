      <p>At 1st level, you can add power to a cure spell as you cast it. As a
      swift action, you can treat any cure spell as if it were empowered (as the
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.77gXSucrxfrE9yWk]{Empower Spell} feat), causing it
      to heal 50% more damage (or deal 50% more damage if used against
      undead).</p>

      <p>This ability doesnâ€™t stack with itself or the Empower Spell feat.</p>
