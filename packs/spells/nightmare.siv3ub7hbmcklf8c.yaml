  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific
    creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate.</p><p>The
    <i>nightmare</i> prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage.
    The <i>nightmare</i> leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane
    spells for the next 24 hours.</p><p>The difficulty of the save depends on
    your knowledge the subject and the physical connection (if any) you have to
    that creature.</p> <table border ='1'><tr><th>Knowledge</th><th>Will Save

    while you are casting the spell dispels the <i>nightmare</i> and causes you
    to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the <i>dispel
    evil</i>.</p><p>If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can
    choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the
    recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the
    casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a
    concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the
    spell ends.</p><p>If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your
    surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.</p><p>You are
    defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You always
    fail Reflex and Will saving throws, for example.) Creatures who don't sleep
    (such as outsiders) or dream are immune to this spell.</p>
