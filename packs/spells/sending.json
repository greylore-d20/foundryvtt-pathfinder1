Even if the <i>sending</i> is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.</p><p>If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the <i>sending</i> does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)</p>",
