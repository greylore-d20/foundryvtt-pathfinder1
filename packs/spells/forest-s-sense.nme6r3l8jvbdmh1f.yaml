      <p>You can sense the location of a target creature within range if it is
      also within 10 feet of a living plant or fungus. You must be able to
      target the creature by tangible qualities such as its build, clothing
      texture, size, or tracks, but you need not have line of effect to your
      target. The fungus or plants near the target serve as a scrying sensor for
      this spell. Your senses of hearing, smell, and touch extend to all fungus
      and plants within 10 feet of the target, allowing you to gauge the size
      and shape of nearby objects and potentially to overhear conversations in
      which the target is currently participating. Your scent ability and
      tremorsense extend through this scrying sensor if you have them, but any
      other special senses you might have do not. For 1 day after casting this
      spell, you gain a +5 insight bonus on Survival checks to track creatures
      you sensed via the spell. You can dismiss this bonus on Survival
      checks.</p>
