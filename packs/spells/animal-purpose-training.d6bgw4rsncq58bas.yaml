      Animal skill), which can be any purpose except combat training-fighting,
      guarding, heavy labor, hunting, performance, or riding. This purpose
      supersedes the animal's previous trained purpose and any tricks it
      knows.</p><p>When the spell ends, the animal reverts to its previous
