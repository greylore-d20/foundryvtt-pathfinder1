      <p>This spell emanates from your mouth and functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.kjke96zd1j1jz48z]{Stinking Cloud}, except as noted
      above. The effect is barely visible and does not obscure vision. The
      nausea effect resembles that of an extreme hangover. This is a poison
      effect. Cayden Cailean's church uses this spell to disperse angry crowds,
      such as when celebrations get out of hand.</p>
