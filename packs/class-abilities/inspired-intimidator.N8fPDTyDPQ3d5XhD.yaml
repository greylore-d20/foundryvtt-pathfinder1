  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the investigator succeeds at an Intimidate check to demoralize an
      opponent, he can expend one use of inspiration to automatically increase
      the result of the check by 5 for the purpose of determining the duration
      of the demoralize effect. He can choose to spend multiple uses to
      inspiration in this manner to further increase the duration of the
      demoralize effect. He must be trained in Intimidate to take this
      talent.</p>

      <p>The underworld inspiration investigator talent has no effect on this
      talent.</p>
