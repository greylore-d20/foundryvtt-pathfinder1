    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the barbarian charges, she may push past one of her allies.
      That ally does not block the path of the charge as long as the ally is not
      adjacent to the target of the charge. This does not move the allyâ€™s
      position; it simply allows the barbarian to move past.</p>
