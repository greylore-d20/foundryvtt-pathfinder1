  shortDescription: >-
    <p>By immersing yourself fully in the intricacies of a carved or written
    rune of any kind, you can divine the elements of that rune's nature. While
    casting <i>rune trace</i>, you must run your fingers (which cannot be gloved
    at the time) over the rune, glyph, symbol, or other marking you want to
    examine (hereafter referred to as the "rune"). This does not trigger any
    effects that touching the rune would normally trigger. Runes, symbols, and
    other effects that trigger when read still trigger as normal if you do so-
    but note that this spell does not require you to view and read the rune that
    you're targeting. When the spell's casting time ends, you instantly receive
    flashes of insight regarding the rune's nature, history, and purpose,
    including the following information. <br><b>Age</b>: You learn if the rune
    was placed within the last 24 hours, within the last month, within the last
    year, within the last decade, within the last century, or prior to the last
    century. <br><b>Insight</b>: If you have cast <i>rune trace</i> on a magical
    rune, you gain a +5 bonus on all skill rolls and checks to dispel, disable,
    or otherwise tamper with the rune. <br><b>Language</b>: You learn what
    language the character of the rune is taken from, or in the case of a rune
    that has no language, you learn that it is a unique image. <b>Purpose</b>:
    You learn the general purpose of the rune (such as whether it's a
    decoration, information, a magical defense, or a warning).</p>
