  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a fine wooden carriage with whatever cosmetic embellishments
      you desire. It is well constructed, although not exceptionally
      ostentatious. The carriage can carry up to six Medium or Small passengers.
      When conjured, the carriage comes with a team of two quasi-real light
      horses, which are already harnessed to the carriage. At your command, an
      invisible coachman similar to an <i>unseen servant</i> can assume the role
      of driver and direct the carriage, although it can't perform any complex
      or dangerous driving, and fails any checks made to drive the carriage in
      such conditions. At the end of the spell's duration, the carriage, horses,
      and coachman disappear into nothingness, depositing everything on or in it
      on the ground in its space.</p>
