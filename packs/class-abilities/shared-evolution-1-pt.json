This functions as the summonerâ€™s aspect ability, and the same limitations apply. The summoner can touch the eidolon as a standard action to return the evolution. The evolution returns to the eidolon automatically if the eidolon is dismissed by the summoner or sent back to its home plane.</p>\n<p>This evolution can only be taken by Summoners with the Twinned Summoner archetype.</p>"
