  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can emit a flash of light from your holy
      symbol or divine focus. The most powerful light emanates out 20 feet from
      you. Creatures with fewer Hit Dice than your cleric level within this area
      are blinded for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. All
      creatures in this area are dazzled for a number of rounds equal to 1/2
      your cleric level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times
      per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Sun's Blessing power of the Sun Domain.</p>
