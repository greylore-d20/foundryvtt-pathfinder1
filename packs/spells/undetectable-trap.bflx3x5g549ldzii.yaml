  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You shroud a single trap with a powerful illusion to make it more
      difficult to locate. Spells like <em>detect magic</em> can't locate any
      magic aura from either the target trap or from <em>undetectable trap</em>.
      Furthermore, a character under the effect of the <em>find traps</em> spell
      doesn't receive an automatic chance to locate the target trap when she
      comes within 10 feet of it, and the bonus on Perception checks from
      <em>find traps</em> doesn't apply to attempts to notice the target trap.
      Add 1/2 your caster level to the DC for any creature without the
      trapfinding class ability to notice the target trap with Perception
      checks.</p><p>A ranger with the ranger traps class feature (<em>Pathfinder
      RPG Ultimate Magic</em> 64) can cast this spell on a ranger trap he
      creates as part of the same action he uses to prepare a ranger trap. This
      doesn't reduce the spell's casting time if such a ranger casts this spell
      on an ordinary trap, even one that he created himself using Craft
      (traps).</p>
