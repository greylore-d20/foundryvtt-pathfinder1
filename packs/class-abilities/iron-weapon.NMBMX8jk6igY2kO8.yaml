  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can create a melee simple or martial weapon that lasts for 1 minute
      for every oracle level you possess. This weapon is appropriate for your
      size and entirely made of metal (even if it would normally include
      non-metal parts, such as a spear's shaft) but functions as if it were a
      normal weapon of its type. You are considered proficient with this weapon.
      The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the blade is made of cold iron.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the blade gains a +1
      enhancement bonus.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, the blade is made of adamantine.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Charisma modifier.</p>
