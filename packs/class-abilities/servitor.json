This ability functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.kyo0kwhw2jhuztju]{Summon Monster I}, but you can use it only to summon a single creature, and the effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the level of the summon monster spell increases by 1, to a maximum of @Compendium[pf1.spells.et3440o24hcgrfwl]{Summon Monster VII} at 19th level. You canâ€™t have more than one servitor in effect at a time.</p>\n<p>At any time, you can expend 1 point of mental focus as a free action to extend the duration of an active servitor by 1 minute.</p>"
