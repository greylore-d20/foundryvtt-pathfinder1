      <p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small
      or Medium <em>animal</em> and back again once per day. Her options for new
      forms include all creatures with the <em>animal</em> type. This ability
      functions like the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.tjdfluulncmqacc3]{beast shape I} spell,
      except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or
      until she changes back. Changing form (to <em>animal</em> or back) is a
      standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form
      chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p><p>A druid
      loses her ability to speak while in <em>animal</em> form because she is
      limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she
      can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping
      as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so
      changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p><p>A druid can use this
      ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels
      thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a
      druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability
      allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals,
      <em>elementals</em>, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this
      ability, regardless of the form taken.</p><p>At 6th level, a druid can use
      wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny <em>animal</em> or a Small
      <em>elemental</em>. When taking the form of an <em>animal</em>, a druid’s
      wild shape now functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.774kmgcb7ygviht0]{beast shape II}. When
      taking the form of an <em>elemental</em>, the druid’s wild shape functions
      as @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.pawbnw1nm4f0b98e]{elemental body
      I}.</p><p>At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge
      or Diminutive <em>animal</em>, a Medium <em>elemental</em>, or a Small or
      Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid’s wild
      shape now functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.w88ddxpu89qcr5c0]{beast shape III}. When
      taking the form of an elemental, the druid’s wild shape now functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.yldjnorgbx4jsldz]{elemental body II}.
      When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid’s wild shape functions
      as @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.y653mq8kmma3kg3w]{plant shape
      I}.</p><p>At 10th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large
      <em>elemental</em> or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an
      <em>elemental</em>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.hd32fuc6e7j4isbn]{elemental body III}.
      When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.ik4riccm7tozdwox]{plant shape
      II}.</p><p>At 12th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge
      <em>elemental</em> or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an
      <em>elemental</em>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.v42t5kpxc8mvd615]{elemental body IV}.
      When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.sheso071mxbywlah]{plant shape III}.</p>
