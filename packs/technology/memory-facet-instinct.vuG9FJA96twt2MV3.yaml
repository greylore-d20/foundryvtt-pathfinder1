      <p>A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb.
      This potent device is used to store programming meant to augment or change
      an AI's functional nature. Full rules for memory facets are on page 62 of
      <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #86: Lords of Rust</em>. The memory facets
      detailed below can be found in this adventure.</p><p><strong>Instinct
      Facet</strong>: This memory facet enhances the AI's ability to act on
      instinct. It grants a +6 bonus to the AI's Wisdom score and grants Combat
      Reflexes as a bonus feat. The AI can use either its Wisdom modifier or its
      aggregate's Dexterity modifier (its choice) to determine the number of
      attacks of opportunity this bonus feat grants.</p>
