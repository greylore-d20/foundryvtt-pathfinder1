      Groups</b> Polearms</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This polearm consists of two
      curved metal bands that close around a target when you attack, allowing
      you to bind an opponent. A mancatcher is built to capture a creature of a
      particular size category (such as Small or Medium) and doesn't work on
      creatures of the wrong size. Make a touch attack to hit an opponent and a
      combat maneuver check to grapple him (without the -4 penalty for not
      having two hands free); success means you and the target are grappled.
      Once the target is grappled, you can perform a move or damage grapple
      action against him. The mancatcher has hardness 10 and 5 hit points;
      breaking it requires a DC 26 Strength check. If you drop the mancatcher,
      the target can free himself as a standard action.</p>
