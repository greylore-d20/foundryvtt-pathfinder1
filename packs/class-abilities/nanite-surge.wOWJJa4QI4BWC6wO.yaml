  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, once per day as an <em>immediate action</em>, you can
      cause your nanites to surge, granting you a bonus equal to 3 + your
      <em>sorcerer</em> level on any one d20 roll; this ability must be
      activated before the roll is made. If you already possess the nanite surge
      ability from another source (such as from being an android), you can use
      your nanite surge an additional time per day.</p>

      <p>At 9th level, you can use this ability an additional time per day.</p>
