      "value": "<p><b>Footprints Book (APG)</b> This 50-page tome contains accurate drawings of various common <em>animal</em>, <em>humanoid</em>, and monster tracks, as well as notes on stride length, tread depth, and similarly useful information. The book gives you a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> to identify a creature by its tracks, though the use of shoes makes identifying many <em>humanoids</em> difficult or impossible. Though the book can't help you identify unique individuals, it can help you tell an <em>ogre</em> footprint from a <em>troll</em> footprint, or an <em>elf's</em> track from an <em>orc's</em>. Books sold in different areas may have different footprints, depending on what creatures are common to that location. <b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1115</em></p>"
