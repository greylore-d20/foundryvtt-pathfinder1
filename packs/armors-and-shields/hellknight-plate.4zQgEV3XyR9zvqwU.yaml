      <p>These distinctive suits of armor are a special type of masterwork full
      plate that grant additional effects when worn by a character with levels
      in the Hellknight prestige class. Apart from its distinctive look (each
      order of Hellknights has its own style of armor), a suit of Hellknight
      plate functions the same as a suit of masterwork full plate.</p>
