  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An alchemical cartridge is a prepared bundle of black powder with a
      bullet or pellets, sometimes with more exotic material added, which is
      then wrapped in paper or cloth and sealed with beeswax, lard, or tallow.
      There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the
      paper cartridgeâ€”a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a
      bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the
      time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard
      action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes
      a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a
      weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each
      entry.</p><p><strong>Salt Shot</strong>: This mix of black powder and rock
      salt can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or other
      scatter weapon. It deals nonlethal instead of lethal damage, and increases
      the misfire value by 1. You can use it only with a scatter weapon's cone
      attack.</p>
