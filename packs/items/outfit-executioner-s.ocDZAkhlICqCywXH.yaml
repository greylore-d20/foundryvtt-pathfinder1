      <p>Typically worn by jailers or executioners, this outfit includes a black
      woolen shirt, a tunic, pants, a belt, sturdy boots, a balaclava or hood,
      and a great cloak. This outfit is generally too intimidating and macabre
      to be worn in polite company.</p><p>Some executioner's outfits prominently
      bear the symbol of the government or law-enforcing institution the wearer
      serves, while others are left ragged and stained to appear all the more
      threatening.</p>
