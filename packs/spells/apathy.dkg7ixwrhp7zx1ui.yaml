    value: >-
      <p>You cause a creature to temporarily lose interest in a passion or
      pursuit, taking the heat off your trail to facilitate a getaway, the
      finalization of a scheme, or the elimination of incriminating evidence.
      When casting the spell, you designate a subject or activity about which
      the target becomes indifferent. While under the effects of <i>apathy</i>,
      the target takes a -5 penalty on all skill checks and ability checks to
      investigate, pursue, or otherwise advance its goals in relation to the
      designated subject. In most cases, however, the target does not attempt
      such checks if they can be avoided, as it simply has no interest in
      putting effort into the endeavor.  If the chosen activity is something
      that would be harmful for the target to refrain from doing (such as
      eating, sleeping, or holding its breath underwater), the target receives a
      +5 bonus on the saving throw or other check required by its inaction, and
      receives a new saving throw to negate the effects of this spell with the
      same +5 bonus immediately after. The bonus on these saving throws and
      checks increases by 1 for each subsequent check required by the same
      condition. If you directly interact with the target of this spell (such as
      engaging it in combat or targeting it with another spell or effect), the
      spell immediately ends.</p>
