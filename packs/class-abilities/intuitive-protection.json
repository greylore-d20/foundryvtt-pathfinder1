      "value": "<p>When a conjuration (summoning) spell is cast by an opponent and the magus successfully identifies the spell with a Spellcraft check, he can spend 1 point form his arcane pool as an immediate action to cast&nbsp;protection from chaos,&nbsp;evil,&nbsp;good, or&nbsp;law&nbsp;(chosen when using this ability) on himself; this lasts a number of rounds equal to his magus level. At 7th level, he can instead cast&nbsp;magic circle against chaos,&nbsp;evil,&nbsp;good, or&nbsp;law&nbsp;when using this ability.</p>\n<p>The magus must be at least 3rd level before selecting this arcana.</p>"
