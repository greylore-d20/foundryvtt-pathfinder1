      <p><b>Element</b> earth, water, wood; <b>Type</b> form infusion;
      <b>Level</b> 3; <b>Burn</b> 2<br><b>Associated Blasts</b> earth, ice,
      metal<br><b>Saving Throw</b> none</p>

      <p>You extend a long, sharp spike of elemental matter along a line,
      impaling multiple foes. Make a single attack roll against each creature or
      object in a 30-foot line, starting with the closest target. If the result
      is a critical threat, roll to confirm against only the first target you
      hit. Calculate damage against each target you hit, starting from the
      closest. If your attack hits a target but fails to deal physical damage to
      that target, the spike fails to penetrate and the infused blast doesnâ€™t
      continue.</p>

      <p>A blast with the impale infusion can penetrate solid barriers, but it
      must deal enough damage to destroy the barrier in order to continue
      through. Infused earth and metal blasts always deal piercing damage.</p>
