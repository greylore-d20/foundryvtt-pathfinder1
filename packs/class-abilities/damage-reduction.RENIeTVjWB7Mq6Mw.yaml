  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, the character gains <em>damage reduction</em>. Subtract 1
      from the damage the character takes each time she is dealt damage from a
      weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three class levels
      thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this <em>damage reduction</em>
      rises by 1 point. <em>Damage reduction</em> can reduce damage to 0 but not
      below 0.</p>
