      <p>This spell allows you to channel the essence of Cayden Cailean's
      philosophy, giving you the benefits of a <i>freedom of movement</i> spell
      and granting you a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects. The
      spell also makes you drunk. For the duration of the spell, you take a -2
      penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and concentration
      checks. If you somehow remove or avoid these penalties, the spell's
      duration ends.</p>
