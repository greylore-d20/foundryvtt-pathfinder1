      <p>Upon the casting of this spell, complete <i>silence</i> prevails in the
      affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells
      with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues
      from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point
      in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The
      spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the
      creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will
      save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a
      creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits
      of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space
      do not. Creatures in an area of a <i>silence</i> spell are immune to sonic
      or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.</p>
