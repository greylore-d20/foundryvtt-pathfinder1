  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, the shaman can command trees and other plants to yield
      magical berries and fruit. This ability functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.k4whhwm1dsz2upkm]{Goodberry}, except the maximum
      number of hit points it can restore to a subject in a 24-hour period from
      this hex is equal to the shamanâ€™s Charisma modifier (minimum 1 hit point
      per day).</p>
