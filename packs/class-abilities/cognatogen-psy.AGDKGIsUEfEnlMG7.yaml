    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, you can create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that
      heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability
      score. When you imbibe a cognatogen, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus and
      a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 1 minute per
      psychic level.</p>

      <p>In addition, while the cognatogen is in effect, you take a –2 penalty
      to one of your physical ability scores. If the cognatogen enhances your
      Intelligence, it applies a penalty to your Strength. If it enhances your
      Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your
      Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this
      ability works just like the alchemist’s mutagen ability (Pathfinder RPG
      Advanced Player’s Guide 28). When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you
      take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the
      cognatogen.</p>

      <p>If you have both alchemist and psychic levels, these levels stack to
      determine the duration of your cognatogen and the DC of the save a
      non-alchemist must attempt if he drinks your cognatogen.</p>

      <p>If you gain discoveries, you can take the grand cognatogen and greater
      cognatogen discoveries to improve your cognatogen.</p>

      <p>The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability
      apply to cognatogens. However, even if you have alchemist levels, the
      duration of your cognatogen remains 1 minute per level (instead of 10
      minutes per level) and you can still create only one per day (instead of
      an unlimited number) unless you also possess the cognatogen discovery.</p>
