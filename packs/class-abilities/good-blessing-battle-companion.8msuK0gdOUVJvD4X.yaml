    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability
      functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.aqri3zf6mzgd4di6]{Summon Monster IV}
      with a duration of 1 minute, but for only a good outsider or an animal
      with the celestial creature simple template.</p>

      <p>This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used.
      For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the summon monster spell
      increases by 1 (to a maximum of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mi52crelhwuy6bmp]{Summon Monster IX} at 20th
      level).</p>
