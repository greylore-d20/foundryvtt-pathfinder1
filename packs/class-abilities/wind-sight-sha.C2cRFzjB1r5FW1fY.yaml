  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman ignores the penalties on Perception checks caused by wind
      and the first 100 feet of distance. At 7th level she can, as a standard
      action, hear or see into any area—as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.6kmkxepwgsbta6ui]{clairaudience/clairvoyance},
      using that spell’s range—provided that there’s an unobstructed path for
      air to travel between the shaman and the target area. This doesn’t require
      line of effect, meaning the path can turn corners and go through spaces as
      narrow as 1 inch in diameter. The shaman can use this ability a number of
      rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to
      be consecutive.</p>
