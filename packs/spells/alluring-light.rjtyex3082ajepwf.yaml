      <p>You glow with a soft radiance that calls out to all who see it. Each
      enemy that fails its save is drawn to you and must use its move action to
      approach you at the beginning of each of its turns for 1 round per caster
      level. An affected target must move toward you in the most direct path it
      can, though it can step around obstacles or other creatures. This spell
      can't force a creature to walk into an area that might obviously harm or
      kill it (such as into a pit, over a patch of floor studded with caltrops,
      or through a <i>wall of fire</i>). An affected creature that loses sight
      of you is not compelled to move toward you, although if it later regains
      vision of you while still affected by this spell, it must again move
      toward you. Any hostile action against an affected creature (such an
      attack of opportunity due to its movement) cancels the spell's effect
      against that creature. Your initial flash of light also increases the
      light level within the spell's area by one step, up to normal light
      (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light) for 1
      round per caster level.</p>
