    spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is

    spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast
    these spells normally.</p><p><i>Retain:</i> You retain any spell of 3rd
    level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting
    the <i>mnemonic enhancer</i>.</p><p>This restores the previously cast spell

    retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).</p>
