  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to move or
      extinguish one 5-foot square per arcanist level of an ongoing nonmagical
      fire. If she chooses to move a portion of the fire, it must be moved to a
      square contiguous with that fire. If she also expends a spell slot of at
      least 3rd level when activating this ability, she can attempt to dispel a
      magical fire effect, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel
      Magic}.</p>
