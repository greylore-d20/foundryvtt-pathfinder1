  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, a swashbuckler with at least 1 panache point can, as a
      standard action, purposefully miss a creature she could make a melee
      attack against with a wielded light or one-handed piercing weapon. When
      she does, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC until the start
      of the swashbuckler's next turn.</p>
