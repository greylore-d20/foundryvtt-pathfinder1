  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base
      speed as a move action. He may use Stealth as part of this movement, but
      takes a –10 penalty to his check for doing so.</p>

      <p>At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>
