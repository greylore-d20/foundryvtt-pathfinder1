    value: >-
      <p>The witch may bless a bush, plant, or tree that is planted in the
      ground, so that it creates a plentiful harvest. Each day at dawn, this
      blessed bush grows a number of goodberries equal to twice her witch level.
      Berries on the tree remain until they are picked, but the tree can never
      manifest a number of berries greater than twice her level at one time.</p>

      <p>The witch may only have one witchâ€™s bounty active at a time, but can
      shift her blessing to a new plant with a ritual requiring 1 hour.</p>
