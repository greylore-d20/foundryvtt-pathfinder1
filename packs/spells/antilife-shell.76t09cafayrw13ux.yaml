  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents
      the entrance of most types of living creatures.</p><p>The effect hedges
      out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts,
      monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and vermin, but not constructs,
      elementals, outsiders, or undead.</p><p>This spell may be used only
      defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against
      creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.</p>
