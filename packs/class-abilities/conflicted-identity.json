      "value": "<p>The vigilanteâ€™s mind is in a constant state of turmoil, which makes him even more ethically and morally fluid than other vigilantes. When targeted by a harmful spell or effect that would affect the vigilante in his current identity but not his other identity (or when he would suffer a lesser effect in his other identity), he has a 50% chance of being affected as though he were in his other identity. This chance is rolled when the spell or effect is cast or triggered and before any spell resistance roll, if applicable. For example, if a vigilante has a lawful-neutral social identity and a neutral vigilante identity, he has a 50% chance of taking only half damage from a&nbsp;chaos hammer&nbsp;spell while in his social identity, since he would always take only half damage from a&nbsp;chaos hammer&nbsp;spell when in his vigilante identity.</p>"
