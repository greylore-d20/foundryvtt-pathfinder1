      <h3>Description</h3><p>This ballista bolt consists of dozens of small
      steel darts, called  flechettes, which break away after the bolt is
      released. If the  bolt impacts anything before it reaches a distance of 30
      feet, it  deals 1d8 points of damage. Between 30 and 60 feet away, the 
      flechettes deploy, dealing piercing damage to every creature  and object
      within a 30-foot-cone burst. After 60 feet, the  flechettes lose momentum
      and fall harmlessly to the ground.</p><p>Separate attack rolls must be
      made against each target hit by  the burst. Light ballista flechettes deal
      2d8 points of damage,  while heavy ballista flechettes deal 3d8 points.
      Additionally, any  winged creature hit by flechettes has several holes
      punched in  its wings, and has its fly speed reduced by 10 feet. The
      creature  takes a -4 penalty on Fly checks until the damage is healed.</p>
