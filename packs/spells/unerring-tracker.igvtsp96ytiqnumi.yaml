  description:
    value: >-
      <p>During this spell's duration, you can touch the sign of a creature's
      passage that you have identified using the Survival skill to make the
      other steps in the creature's path perfectly clear to you, no matter how
      minute. This trail can't be more than 24 hours old. You can follow the
      trail at any speed, provided you have line of sight to the trail. You can
      distinguish the trail of the particular creature followed even if it joins
      and splits with other trails. Once you have selected a trail to follow
      using this spell, it can't be changed.  The spell is unable to follow
      teleportation or interplanar travel for any distance. The trail appears to
      end where the creature teleported (though a successful Spellcraft check
      allows you to determine the method of teleportation, if a spell was used).
      <i>Unerring tracker</i> can't track creatures under the effect of a
      <i>pass without trace</i> spell, as those creatures leave no trail at all,
      but can track creatures using <i>nondetection</i> (though not <i>mind</i>
      blank).  This spell can be used to track flying creatures, but the trail
      must at least begin on a solid surface.  This spell doesn't reveal the
      creature's current position or any shorter path than the one it followed
      (for instance, it will not reveal that the creature doubled back upon the
      trail until you reach the point where the creature turned around.) It
      doesn't reveal traps or other hazards along the trail.</p>
