  shortDescription: >-
    <p>All recurring afflictions (those with a frequency,including curses,
    diseases, and poison) possessed by the targeted creature immediately
    trigger, requiring an immediate saving throw (as described in the
    affliction) to avoid suffering their effects. A successful saving throw does
    not count toward ending the affliction, and this extra save does not change
    the timing of the next save against the affliction. Afflictions without a
    frequency are unaffected by this spell.</p>
