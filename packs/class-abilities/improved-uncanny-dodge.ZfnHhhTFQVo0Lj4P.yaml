    value: >-
      <p>This character can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue
      the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the
      attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has class
      levels.</p>

      <p>If a character already has <em>uncanny dodge</em> (see above) from
      another class, the levels from the classes that grant <em>uncanny
      dodge</em> stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank
      the character.</p>
