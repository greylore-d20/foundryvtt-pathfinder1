  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You are surrounded by a nimbus of golden light shaped like your god's
    holy symbol or a symbol of your faith. Any evil creature striking you with
    unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal damage,
    but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per
    caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are
    not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell resistance applies
    against this damage. You also take half damage from magical attacks with the
    evil descriptor. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you
    take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p>
