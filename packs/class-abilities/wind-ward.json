When a warded creature is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack suffers a 20% miss chance.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the ward lasts for 1 minute for every level the shaman possesses.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, the miss chance increases to 50%.</p>\n<p>Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>"
