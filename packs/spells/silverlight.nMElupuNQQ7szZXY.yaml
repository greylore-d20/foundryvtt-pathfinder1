      <p>As @Compendium[pf1.spells.7x2z0i8rcx7s81fk]{daylight}, except the
      object touched sheds bright silvery light in a 20-foot radius. In addition
      to providing illumination, the area of bright light is painful to
      creatures that are susceptible to alchemical silver. A creature with
      DR/silver that begins its turn within the light of this spell is
      automatically
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.xHUnCadQ2qYsfvV0]{dazzled}
      and becomes
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.7LwCMwrX3tchvrjW]{sickened}
      unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. These effects disappear 1 round
      after the target leaves the <em>silverlight</em>. A creature that leaves
      the area and then returns must make a new saving throw. This spell
      provides dim light up to 40 feet away, but only creatures within 20 feet
      are subject to the above e!ects.</p>
