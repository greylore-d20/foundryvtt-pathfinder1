  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it a glorious blessing.
      For 1 minute, the ally becomes mesmerizing to her foes. This functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.yk5bgi6j9kbtigof]{Sanctuary}, except if the ally
      attacks an opponent, this effect ends with respect to only that opponent.
      This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
