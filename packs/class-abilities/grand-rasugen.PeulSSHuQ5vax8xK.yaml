  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist’s rasugen now grants a +6 alchemical bonus on all saving
      throws, 4 temporary hit points per alchemist level, and immunity to
      disease, mind-affecting effects, and poison. The alchemist takes a –6
      penalty to Intelligence and a –2 penalty to Charisma and Wisdom as long as
      the grand rasugen persists.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 16th level and have the greater rasugen
      discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
