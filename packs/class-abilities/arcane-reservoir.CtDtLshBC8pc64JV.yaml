  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon
      to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist’s
      arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 +
      the arcanist’s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist’s
      arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points
      equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous
      day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells
      class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never
      hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in
      excess of this total are lost.<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are
      used to fuel many of the arcanist’s powers. In addition, the arcanist can
      expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she
      casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the
      caster level by 1 or increase the spell’s DC by 1. She can expend no more
      than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>
