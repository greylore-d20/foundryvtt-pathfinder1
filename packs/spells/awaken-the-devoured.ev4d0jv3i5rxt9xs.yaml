    value: >-
      <p>This spell is often used by conjurers as a method to torment daemons
      and force compliance, for it awakens the broken, anguished memories of the
      countless souls that the target daemons have consumed. All daemons
      targeted by <i>Awaken the Devoured</i> must be within 30 feet of each
      other. The fragmented memories haunt and afflict the daemons, dealing 1d8
      points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and making the daemons
      confused for 1 round per level. A daemon that succeeds at a Will save
      halves the damage and negates the confusion effect.</p>
