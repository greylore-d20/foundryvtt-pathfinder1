    value: >-
      <p>With a clammy caress and a word to the powers lurking beyond death, you
      can reshape a dead body look like another creature or even a specific
      person so long as you have firsthand knowledge of how that creature or
      person actually looks.</p><p>You can make the corpse one size larger or
      smaller and change anything else about it including its apparent type,
      gender, or age. Creatures with a reason to suspect deception may make a
      Will saving throw to realize that the corpse was altered. If you chose to
      make the corpse look like a specific individual anyone who knows that
      individual can make a Will save to realize that the corpse is not actually
      that person. However, if a creature fails its Will save by 5 or less they
      believe the corpse is that of someone who closely resembled the person
      they knew rather than a deliberate fake. This spell merely changes the
      appearance of the corpse. Any spell or effect that targets the corpse
      (such as <i>speak with dead</i> or <i>raise dead</i>) treats it as if it
      still had its original appearance.</p>
