      <p>You wrap the target in a mantle of summery air, within which the
      ambient temperature never falls below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Creatures
      with the cold subtype that start their turns in the area take an amount of
      fire damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum
      1d4+5) with no saving throw. Each time an evil dragon, fey, or giant takes
      damage from the spell, it must succeed at a Will saving throw or become
      shaken for 1 round. Creatures attempting to cast a cold spell in the area
      must succeed at a Will save or the spell fails. Succeeding at one such
      save to cast a spell allows a creature to continue casting cold spells in
      the area for the spell's remainder.</p>
