      <p>This chunk of crystal shines with the colors of the rainbow. A
      prismatic crystal can be used as a focus for the read aura occult skill
      unlock to reduce the time needed to read an aura from 10 minutes to 5
      minutes. When held by psychic creatures, these crystals also emit light in
      a small area, increasing the light level in a 10-foot radius by one step
      (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). A
      prismatic crystal canâ€™t increase the light level above normal light.</p>
