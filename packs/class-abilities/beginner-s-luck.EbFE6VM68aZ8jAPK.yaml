  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante appears so harmless and innocent that onlookers dismiss
      his incredible abilities as nothing more than beginner’s luck. When the
      vigilante uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity, he can add
      the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise to his Disguise check to
      fool onlookers, so long as the number of onlookers witnessing him is no
      greater than his vigilante level. The vigilante’s PC allies do not count
      as onlookers (and at the GM’s discretion, a closely allied NPC might not
      count as an onlooker, either). He loses this bonus against onlookers who
      have already witnessed him using a vigilante talent in his social identity
      within the last week.</p>
