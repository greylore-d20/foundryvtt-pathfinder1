    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, your touch inflicts mummy rot on those you strike. You
      can choose to suppress this ability for 1 round as a <em>swift
      action</em>. You can make a <em>touch attack</em> to inflict this
      <em>disease</em> on a target, or transfer it as part of an attack with any
      melee weapon or touch-based spell. The creature touched can resist
      contracting mummy rot by making a <em>Fortitude</em> save â€“ the DC is
      equal to 10 + 1/2 your <em>sorcerer</em> level + your <em>Charisma</em>
      modifier.</p>
