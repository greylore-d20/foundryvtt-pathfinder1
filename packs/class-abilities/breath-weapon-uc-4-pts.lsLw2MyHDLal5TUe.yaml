      <p><b>Requirements:</b> Summoner level 9th.</p>

      <p>The eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line of magical energy, gaining
      a breath weapon. Select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The eidolon can
      breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of damage
      of the selected type per Hit Dice it possesses. Those caught in the breath
      weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal to 10 +
      1/2 the eidolon’s Hit Dice + the eidolon’s Constitution modifier. The
      eidolon can use this ability once per day.</p>

      <p>The eidolon can gain additional uses of this ability per day by
      spending 1 evolution point per additional use (to a maximum of three total
      uses per day).</p>
