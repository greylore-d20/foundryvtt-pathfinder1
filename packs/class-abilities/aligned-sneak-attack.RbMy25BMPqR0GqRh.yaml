    value: >-
      <p>When making a sneak attack against a creature that has damage reduction
      that can be overcome by weapons of a particular alignment (such as DR
      5/good), the character’s attack reduces that damage reduction by an amount
      equal to the number of sneak attack dice rolled until the end of the
      character’s turn.</p>
