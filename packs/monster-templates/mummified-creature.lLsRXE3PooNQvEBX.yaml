      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Many ancient cultures mummify their
      dead, preserving the bodies of the deceased through lengthy and complex
      funerary and embalming processes. While the vast majority of these corpses
      are mummified simply to preserve the bodies in the tombs where they are
      interred, some are mummified with the help of magic to live on after death
      as mummified creatures. A mummified creature appears much as other mummies
      do—a dusty corpse, desiccated and withered, swathed in a funeral shroud of
      linen wrappings adorned with hieroglyphs—but a spark of malign
      intelligence gleams in its unliving eyes.<p>Mummified creatures differ
      from the standard mummy presented in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary with
      regard to how and why they are created. Most standard mummies are created
      as simple tomb guardians; they gain abilities such as an aura of despair
      and mummy rot, but they usually lose their free will, much of their
      intelligence, and the abilities they possessed in life. A mummified
      creature, on the other hand, retains its intelligence, memories, and many
      of its other abilities. A mummified creature does not spread the curse of
      mummy rot, nor does the sight of it paralyze the living with fear, but its
      touch can reduce a living creature to dust and its very presence is
      frightening. Though slow and clumsy in undeath, a mummified creature is
      nonetheless capable of surprising bursts of speed and ferocity. Because of
      its creation process, however, a mummified creature is susceptible to
      energy damage, though determining an individual mummified creature’s
      vulnerability is not always easy.<p>Many mummified creatures are created
      to guard the tombs of important figures, but some powerful beings—rulers,
      high priests, mighty wizards, or even wealthy aristocrats—arrange to be
      transformed into mummified creatures upon their deaths. Unwilling to give
      up their lives and knowledge to the whims of fate, these people bind their
      souls to the dried husks of their dead bodies, trading oblivion for
      endless centuries of unlife. The truly wealthy sometimes arrange for their
      most favored spouses, concubines, servants, or guards to be mummified with
      them, enabling them to hold court in dusty tombs in an undead mockery of
      their old lives centuries after they perished.<p>To create a mummified
      creature, a corpse must be prepared through embalming, with its internal
      organs replaced with dried herbs and flowers and its dead skin preserved
      through the application of sacred oils. Unlike with standard mummies, a
      mummified creature’s brain is not removed from its skull after death.
      Injected with strange chemicals and tattooed with mystical hieroglyphs, a
      mummified creature’s brain retains the base creature’s mind and abilities,
      though the process does result in the loss of some mental faculties. Once
      this process is complete, the body is wrapped in special purified linens
      marked with hieroglyphs that grant the mummified creature its new
      abilities (as well as its weakness). Finally, the creator must cast a
      create greater undead spell to give the mummified creature its
      unlife.<p>“Mummified creature” is an acquired template that can be added
      to any living corporeal creature (hereafter referred to as the base
      creature). A mummified creature uses all of the base creature’s statistics
      except as noted here.<p><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature +1.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil.</p>

      <p><b>Type:</b> The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). It
      retains any other subtypes as well, except for alignment subtypes and
      subtypes that indicate kind. Do not recalculate class HD, BAB, saves, or
      skill points.</p>

      <p><b>Senses:</b> A mummified creature gains darkvision 60 feet.</p>

      <p><b>Aura:</b> A mummified creature gains a frightful presence aura with
      a range of 30 feet and a duration of 1d6 rounds.</p>

      <p><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by +4.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are
      unaffected. As an undead, a mummified creature uses its Charisma modifier
      to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).</p>

      <p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A mummified creature gains DR 5/— and the
      defensive abilities granted by the undead type.</p>

      <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> The mummification process leaves a mummified
      creature vulnerable to a single energy type. Choose or determine randomly
      from the following list.</p>

      <p><br>As a fail-safe in case of rebellion, a mummified creature is subtly
      marked during the ritual process with a hieroglyph someplace inconspicuous
      on its body or wrappings that identifies the particular energy type to
      which it is vulnerable. A successful DC 20 Perception check is needed to
      find the mark, but a successful DC 25 Linguistics check is still required
      to decipher the hieroglyph’s meaning.</p>

      <p><b>Speed:</b> Decrease all speeds by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet).
      If the base creature has a flight speed, its maneuverability changes to
      clumsy.</p>

      <p><b>Attacks:</b> The mummification process hardens the mummified
      creature’s bones to a stone-like density, granting the mummif ied creature
      a powerful slam attack if the base creature has no other natural attacks.
      This slam attack deals damage based on the mummified creature’s size
      (Bestiary 302), treating the creature as if it were one size category
      larger.</p>

      <p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A mummified creature gains the following
      special attacks.<p><em>Burst of Vengeance (Su): </em>Despite its slow,
      lumbering nature, a mummified creature is capable of lurching forward to
      attack with a short but surprising explosion of speed. Twice per day as a
      swift action, a mummified creature may act as if affected by a haste spell
      for 1 round.<p><em>Dust Stroke (Su): </em>A creature killed by a mummified
      creature’s natural attack or slam attack is disintegrated into a cloud of
      dust and ash, completely destroying the victim’s body (as
      disintegrate).<p><b>Abilities:</b> Str +4, Int –2 (minimum 1). As an
      undead creature, a mummified creature has no Constitution score.</p>

      <p><b>Feats:</b> A mummified creature gains Toughness as a bonus feat, and
      Improved Natural Attack as a bonus feat for each of the base creature’s
      natural attacks.</p>

      <p><b>Skills:</b> A mummified creature gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth
      checks.</p>
