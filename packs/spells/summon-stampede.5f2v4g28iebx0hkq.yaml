    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a herd of aurochs or similar herd animal that immediately
      stampedes in the direction you indicate. The herd takes up a
      20-foot-radius space and moves at a rate of 120 feet per round in a
      straight line. Any creatures caught in the herd's path take 4d6+9 points
      of damage that round as they are trampled beneath dozens of animals'
      hooves. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.  If the stampede's
      path would put it in an obviously dangerous area (such as over a cliff or
      through a fire) or force it to move through a solid barrier, the herd
      stops at the obstacle and moves in a new randomly determined direction
      until it reaches another obstacle or the spell's duration ends.</p>
