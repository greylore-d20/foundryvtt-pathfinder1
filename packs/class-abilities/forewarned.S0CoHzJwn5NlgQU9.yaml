      <p>You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a
      <em>Perception</em> roll to notice a foe, but you are still considered
      flat-footed until you take an action. In addition, you receive a bonus on
      initiative checks equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1). At 20th
      level, anytime you roll initiative, assume the roll resulted in a natural
      20.</p>
