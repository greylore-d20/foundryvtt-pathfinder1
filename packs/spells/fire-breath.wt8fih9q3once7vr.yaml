      <p>Up to thrice during this spell's duration, you can belch forth a cone
      of fire as a standard action. The first cone deals 4d6 points of fire
      damage to every creature in the area. The second cone of flame deals 2d6
      points of fire damage to every creature in the area. The third cone of
      flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. A
      successful Reflex save halves this damage. After the third cone of flame,
      the spell ends.</p>
