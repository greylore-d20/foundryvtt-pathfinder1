      <p>At 1st level, a witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature
      that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars
      also aid a witch by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and
      help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard’s arcane
      bond class feature, except as noted in the Witch’s Familiar
      section.</p><p>A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare
      her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a
      witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch’s
      familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three
      1st-level spells of the witch’s choice. The witch also selects a number of
      additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in
      her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any
      spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to
      her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar
      through a special ritual.</p><p>Witches can add new spells to their
      familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her
      familiar if those spells belong to the witch’s spell list.</p><h3>Adding
      Spells to a Witch's Familiar</h3><p>Witches can add new spells to their
      familiars through several methods. A witch can only add spells to her
      familiar if those spells belong to the witch’s spell
      list.</p><p><strong>Spells Gained at a New Level</strong>: A witch’s
      familiar learns a certain amount of lore and magic as the witch
      adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two spells from
      the witch spell list to her familiar. The two free spells must be of spell
      levels she can cast.</p><p><strong>Familiar Teaching Familiar</strong>: A
      witch’s familiar can learn spells from another witch’s familiar. To
      accomplish this, the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell
      being taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time, the
      witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a Spellcraft check (DC
      15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the familiar has learned the
      spell and the witch may utilize it the next time she prepares spells. If
      the check fails, the familiar has failed to learn the spell and cannot try
      to learn that spell again until the witch has gained another rank in
      Spellcraft. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater level in
      return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a witch that has died,
      it only retains its knowledge of spells for 24 hours, during which time it
      is possible to coerce or bribe the familiar into teaching its spells to
      another, subject to GM discretion.</p><p><strong>Learn from a
      Scroll</strong>: A witch can use a scroll to teach her familiar a new
      spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of the spell to be learned,
      during which time the scroll is burned and its ashes used to create a
      special brew or powder that is consumed by the familiar. This process
      destroys the scroll. At the end of this time, the witch must make a
      Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process
      went awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the scroll is
      still consumed.</p>
