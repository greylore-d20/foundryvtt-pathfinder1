  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By orchestrating the movement of his ally’s body, the mesmerist imparts
      to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger
      this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill
      check. The subject either uses the mesmerist’s bonus on the skill check in
      place of her own or gains a morale bonus on the check equal to the
      mesmerist’s Charisma bonus, whichever results in a higher modifier.</p>

      <p>The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself.</p>
