      <p>The target of this spell gains immunity to the harmful effects of
      touching or drinking from the River Styx and a +4 profane bonus on saves
      against effects that alter or suppress memory (such as <i>modify
      memory</i> or mindwipeOA). This does not grant the target the ability to
      breathe water, nor does it grant any protection against creatures or
      mundane hazards such as rapids. The spell has no power to restore memory
      to a creature already suffering from an existing fugue or amnesia
      state.</p>
