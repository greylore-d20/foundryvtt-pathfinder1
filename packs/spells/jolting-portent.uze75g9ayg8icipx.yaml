  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The creature you designate is surrounded by a glowing red aura of
    vengeful fate. Once per round when the target makes an attack or casts a
    spell, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC = 10 + 1/2
    caster level + Charisma (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom (in the case of
    clerics). If the target fails the saving throw, it takes 4d6 + your Charisma
    modifier (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom modifier (in the case of
    clerics) electricity damage. It takes no damage on a successful saving
    throw. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when its subject
    confirms a critical hit to negate the critical hit and daze the creature for
    1 round. The attack still hits its target and deals normal damage. The
    effects of the daze occur after the attack.</p>
