      "value": "<p>The alchemist has learned how to preserve a sample of oozes in a sealed bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he actually throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the ooze, which reconstitutes and attacks the closest creature. The ooze is not under the alchemist’s control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The ooze remains for 1 round per caster level, and decays into powder when the duration expires. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a bottled ooze requires an extract with a level equal to the ooze’s CR (so a CR 4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Gray%20Ooze\">gray ooze</a>&nbsp;requires a 4th-level extract). An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
