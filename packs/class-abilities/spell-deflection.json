      "value": "<p>You can use a readied action to counterspell any spell being cast on you or an adjacent ally that requires a ranged touch attack (such as a ray). In order to successfully counter the spell, you must make an unarmed attack roll. If the result of this attack roll is higher than 20 + the spell’s caster level, the spell is negated with no effect.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, any spell you successfully negate is reflected back at the caster with the same ranged touch attack result.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 11th level before selecting this revelation.</p>"
