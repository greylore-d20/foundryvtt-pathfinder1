      "value": "<p>The alchemist learns how to create a sleeper agent, whom he releases back into its original society none the wiser. The alchemist can create a sleeper agent in a ritual that takes 1 minute; the target must be unconscious for the ritual’s duration. At any time during the next year, as long as he is within 1 mile of the sleeper agent, the alchemist can activate the agent’s programming. When the sleeper agent is activated, treat her as if she were the target of a @Compendium[pf1.spells.q070n0zoq3zojpas]{Dominate Person}&nbsp;spell with a caster level equal to the alchemist’s level at the time the sleeper agent was created. If the sleeper agent is killed or the&nbsp;dominate person&nbsp;effect’s duration expires, the sleeper agent is permanently released from the alchemist’s control. The alchemist can also release any sleeper agent as a free action. The alchemist can have one active sleeper agent for every 6 alchemist levels he possesses.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
