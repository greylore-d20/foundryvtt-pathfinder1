    value: >-
      <p>You swear an oath not to reveal your identity, magically preventing
      anyone from discovering it so long as you avoid revealing your face or
      other easily identifiable features. The spell distorts your voice and
      subtly alters your body language and the appearance of your gear and any
      animals you use, whether as companions, mounts, or otherwise. This spell
      does not make you appear to be a different creature type, nor does it
      change your apparent height or body type.  This spell provides you with a
      +10 bonus on Disguise checks to conceal your identity, but not on checks
      to impersonate anyone in particular. This spell distorts the appearance of
      your voice, gear, and animals in the same way each time, essentially
      creating an alternate persona that can be recognized by those who have
      observed it before.</p>
