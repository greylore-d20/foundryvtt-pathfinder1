    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist gains the ability to create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like
      mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a
      physical ability score. If the cognatogen enhances his Intelligence, it
      applies a penalty to his Strength. If it enhances his Wisdom, it applies a
      penalty to his Dexterity. If it enhances his Charisma, it applies a
      penalty to his Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the
      mutagen ability (including the natural armor bonus). Anytime the alchemist
      would prepare a mutagen, he may instead prepare a cognatogen. All
      limitations of mutagens apply to cognatogens as if they were the same
      substance—an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen at a
      time, a cognatogen that is not in an alchemist’s possession becomes inert,
      drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the
      effect of the cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability
      damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. The infuse
      mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to
      cognatogens.</p>
