The tentacles deal 1d8 points of damage if the eidolon is Medium. Eidolons with the grab evolution that is linked to a tentacle mass can use that ability to grapple foes of up to the eidolon’s size, and they can also use this evolution in place of the serpentine base form to qualify for the constrict evolution.</p>"
