      <h3>Description</h3><p>This clay container resembles a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.50ofjPm8BcMLQblh]{fuse grenade}, but
      trails a pulley and wire rather than a fuse. Pulling the cord (a move
      action) sparks a flint and steel within the device, causing the grenade to
      explode. The pull cord can be attached to a door or drawer within 5 feet,
      or strung across a 5-foot square, causing the grenade to detonate when its
      tripwire is disturbed. A pull-cord grenade cannot be reused.</p><p>This
      can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check.</p><h3>Pull-Cord
      Grenade</h3><p><strong>Type</strong> mechanical;
      <strong>Perception</strong> DC 15; <strong>Disable Device</strong> DC
      15</p><h3>Effects</h3><p><strong>Trigger</strong> touch;

      bludgeoning damage and 1d6 fire damage); Reflex DC 15 half; multiple
