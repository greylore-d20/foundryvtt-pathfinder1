      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>A soulbound construct is a
      once-living creature that has had its soul bound to a construct host that
      serves as its new body.<p>“Soulbound construct” is an acquired template
      that can be applied to a construct (referred to hereafter as the host
      construct); this construct draws several of its statistics from a living
      corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or more (referred to
      hereafter as the base creature) whose soul is contained within a soul
      focus. A soulbound construct uses all the host construct’s statistics and
      special abilities except as noted here.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> If the
      base creature has 10 or fewer Hit Dice, host construct’s CR + 1; if the
      base creature has 11 or more Hit Dice, host construct’s CR +
      2.<p><b>Alignment:</b> As per base creature.<p><b>Type:</b> A soulbound
      construct gains any alignment subtypes that the base creature
      had.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> A host construct gains a deflection bonus to AC
      equal to the base creature’s Charisma modifier.<p><b>Weakness:</b> A
      soulbound construct retains all the weaknesses of the host construct and
      gains the following additional weakness.<p><em>Susceptible to
      Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex):</em> A soulbound construct is not immune to
      mind-affecting effects.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A soulbound construct
      gains the following special attack.<p><em>Spell-Like Abilities (Ex):</em>
      A soulbound construct has one or more alignment-based spell-like
      abilities, based upon the base creature’s HD. If the base creature has 1–4
      HD, the soulbound construct can cast the first spell-like ability listed
      in the table below for its alignment once per day. If the base creature
      has 5–10 HD, it can cast the first listed spell-like ability three times
      per day and the second ability once per day. If the base creature has
      11–16 HD, it can cast the first listed spell-like ability at will, the
      second ability three times per day, and the third ability once per day. If
      the base creature has 17–20 HD, it can cast the first and second listed
      spell-like abilities at will and the third ability three times per day.
      The caster level for these abilities is equal to the base creature’s Hit
      Dice. The save DC for these abilities is based on the base creature’s
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, whichever is highest.</p>

      <p><br><b>Ability Scores:</b> The host construct replaces its
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores with those of the base
      creature.<p><b>Skills:</b> A soulbound construct gains the Intelligence-,
      Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills of the soul held in the soul focus. If
      the host construct already has any of these skills, select the higher
      total bonus between that of the base creature and that of the host
      construct.<p><b>Feats:</b> A soulbound construct gains the base creature’s
      feats as bonus feats. Feats that can’t be used by the host construct are
      not added in this way.<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> A soulbound construct
      gains the following special qualities.<p><em>Bind Soul (Su):</em> The
      process to bind the soul focus to the construct body takes 1d10 days of
      continual concentration, and the target construct can attempt a Will save
      (DC = 10 + half the base creature’s Hit Dice + the base creature’s
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest) to
      negate the effect. Mindless constructs receive no save against this
      effect.<p><em>Soul Focus (Su):</em> The base creature’s soul lives within
      a gem called a soul focus. As long as the soul focus remains intact, a
      soulbound construct gains the abilities granted by this template, and it
      retains the base creature’s personality, memories, and thoughts, as well
      as its alignment, mental ability scores, feats, and skills that are based
      on mental ability scores. It does not retain racial modifiers to those
      skills (if any). A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break
      DC of 20.</p>
