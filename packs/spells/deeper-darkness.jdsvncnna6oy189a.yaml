  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.tsndfcfijmgxs37p]{darkness}, except that
      objects radiate <em>darkness</em> in a 60-foot radius and the light level
      is lowered by two steps. Bright light becomes dim light and normal light
      becomes <em>darkness</em>. Areas of dim light and <em>darkness</em> become
      supernaturally dark. This functions like <em>darkness</em>, but even
      creatures with darkvision cannot see within the spell's
      confines.</p><p>This spell does not stack with itself. <em>Deeper
      darkness</em> can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or
      lower spell level.</p>
