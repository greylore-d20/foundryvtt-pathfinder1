      <p>This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached objects and
      creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1
      round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall,
      falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would
      during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of
      the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating
      slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected
      objects and creatures fall downward.</p><p>Provided it has something to
      hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to
      secure itself when the spell strikes.</p><p>Creatures who can fly or
      levitate can keep themselves from falling.</p>
