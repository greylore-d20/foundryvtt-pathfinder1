  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and grant it a chaotic blessing.
      For 1 minute, this weapon glows yellow or purple and deals an additional
      1d6 points of damage against lawful creatures. During this time, it’s
      treated as chaotic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This
      blessing’s additional damage doesn’t stack with the additional damage from
      the anarchic weapon special ability.</p>
