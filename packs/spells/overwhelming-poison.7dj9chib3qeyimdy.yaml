  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell increases the virulence of the targeted dose of poison,
      making the poison more difficult to resist. The poison is unaffected by
      <i>delay poison</i>, and the DC to remove it with <i>neutralize poison</i>
      is increased by 5. Additionally, the poison uses its own saving throw DC
      or <i>overwhelming</i> poison's DC, whichever is higher.  If cast on a
      creature that is currently suffering from exposure to one or more doses of
      poison, the spell applies to one of the doses of your choice, or a random
      dose of poison affecting the target if you don't know what poisons are
      afflicting the target. If cast on a creature that is venomous, this spell
      affects the first dose of poison that creature delivers before the end of
      the spell's duration.</p>
