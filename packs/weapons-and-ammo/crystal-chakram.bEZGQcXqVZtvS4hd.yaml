  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Shaped and carved from quartz or stranger subterranean crystals, these
      circular throwing discs have jagged razor-sharp edges. When a crystal
      chakram strikes a foe, the weapon shatters into tiny sharp fragments; if
      it misses, there is a 50% chance the chakram shatters when it hits the
      ground or another solid object; otherwise it can be retrieved and used
      again. A crystal chakram is treated as ammunition for the purpose of
      creating magic weapons.</p>
