      <p><b>Common Price</b> 15 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.; <b>Masterwork Price</b>
      50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>

      <p><b>Note</b> Each act of torture shifts the torturer's
      <em>alignment</em> one step toward evil, and it counts as a willful evil
      act for the purpose of effects like <em>atonement</em>.</p>

      <p>Both a torture and restraining device, this small, metal armature
      consists of two parallel, spike-studded bars that close together as the
      user tightens the frame's screws, crushing a victim's thumbs between them.
      A victim restrained by a thumbscrew is able to move but can't effectively
      wield weapons, hold items, or perform any actions or skill checks that
      require manual dexterity, taking a -5 penalty on all such actions and
      dealing 1d6 points of <em>nonlethal damage</em> to himself with each
      attempt (this doesn't include <em>Escape Artist</em> attempts to escape
      the thumbscrew).</p>

      <p>Spellcasters bound by thumbscrews are unable to cast spells with
      somatic <em>components</em>.</p>

      <p>When using a thumbscrew as a torture device, the user can turn the
      thumbscrew's bolt to deal 1d6 points of <em>nonlethal damage</em>.</p>

      <p>Escaping from a thumbscrew requires a successful DC 28 <em>Escape
      Artist</em> check (DC 30 for a masterwork thumbscrew).</p>

      <h4>Trephine</h4>

      <p class="source"><b>Source</b>: <em>PZO1135</em></p>

      <p><b>Price</b> 20 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>

      <p><b>Note</b> Each act of torture shifts the torturer's
      <em>alignment</em> one step toward evil, and it counts as a willful evil
      act for the purpose of effects like <em>atonement</em>.</p>

      <p>This surgical instrument has a serrated, circular blade that is used to
      bore holes into the skulls of patients to relieve cranial swelling from
      head trauma or, as some chirurgeons believe, release evil spirits. Use of
      a trephine takes 10 minutes, and deals 5 points of piercing damage to the
      subject creature. With a successful DC 25 <em>Heal</em> check, the user
      can heal up to 1d4 points of <em>ability damage</em> to any one mental
      ability score caused by physical trauma to the head, such as the critical
      called shot or debilitating blow called shot, or it can cure the severe
      brain trauma inflicted by the debilitating blow called shot. If the user
      fails the check, the subject still takes 5 points of piercing damage. If
      the user fails the check by 5 or more, the subject instead takes 10 points
      of piercing damage and 1 point of damage each to its
      <em>Intelligence</em>, <em>Wisdom</em>, and <em>Charisma</em> scores.</p>
