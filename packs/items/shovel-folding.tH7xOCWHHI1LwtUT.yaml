      <p>This tool lets you dig a pit at a rate of 2 cubic feet per
      minute.</p><p>If a shovel is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed
      improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of
      its size.</p><p><strong>Folding Shovel</strong>: A folding shovel is a
      full-sized shovel with a sturdy sectional handle that folds into pieces no
      longer than the shovel blade, allowing it to fit in a smaller space such
      as a backpack. Converting the shovel from its folded state to usable (or
      vice versa) is 2 full-round actions.</p>
