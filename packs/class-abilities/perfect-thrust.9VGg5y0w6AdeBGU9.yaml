  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she
      can as a full-round action make a perfect thrust, pooling all of her
      attack potential into a single melee attack made with a light or
      one-handed piercing melee weapon. When she does, she makes the attack
      against the target's touch AC, and ignores all damage reduction.</p>
