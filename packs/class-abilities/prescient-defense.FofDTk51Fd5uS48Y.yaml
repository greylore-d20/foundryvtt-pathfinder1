  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as an immediate
      action after hitting a target with a weapon attack, granting him a
      premonition of his enemyâ€™s intentions. The magus gains a bonus to his AC
      and on Reflex saves equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) against
      attacks by that opponent until the beginning of his next turn.</p>

      <p>The magus must be at least 9th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
