This functions as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.wgm8mm1za909pwch]{Stone Tell} spell, except with wood instead of stones.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. You can speak with natural or worked wood.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>"
