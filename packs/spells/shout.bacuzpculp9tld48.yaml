      <p>You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in
      its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and
      takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness
      and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object
      or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level
      (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce
      the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate
      damage to them with a successful Reflex save. A <i>shout</i> spell cannot
      penetrate a <i>silence</i> spell.</p>
