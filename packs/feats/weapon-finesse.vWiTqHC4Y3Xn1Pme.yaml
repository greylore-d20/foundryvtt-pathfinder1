    value: >-
      <i>You are trained in using your agility in melee combat, as opposed to
      brute strength.</i>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>With a light weapon, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature
      of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your
      Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check
      penalty applies to your attack rolls.</p>

      <p><b>Special</b></p>

      <p>Natural weapons are considered light weapons.</p>
