  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates a spectral saluqi, an undead canine resembling an
      oversized hound with black fur, a gray ruff and tail, and milky gray eyes.
      The hound shares your alignment and can converse with you telepathically.
      It can see and attack ethereal creatures, and otherwise has the same
      statistics as a yeth hound (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 286). It
      usually leaves no tracks because it prefers to fly an inch above the
      ground. You are immune to the hound's bay ability. The hound's bite is
      considered aligned to any single alignment you possess for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction.</p>
