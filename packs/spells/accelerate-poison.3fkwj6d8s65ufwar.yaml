    value: >-
      <p>You hasten the onset of poison in the target. If the poison normally
      has an onset time, its effects begin immediately. If the poison has no
      onset time, its frequency is doubled, requiring two saving throws and
      inflicting damage twice per round or minute, though its duration is
      halved. Accelerate poison does not change the cure condition for the
      poison. If the target is affected by more than one poison, you may choose
      which is affected if you administered the poison; otherwise, randomly
      determine which poison is affected.</p>
