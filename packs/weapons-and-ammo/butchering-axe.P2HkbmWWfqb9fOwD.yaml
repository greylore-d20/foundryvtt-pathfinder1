      Groups</b> Axes</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A creation of the orc smiths of
      Belkzen, this axe has an oversized head bristling with spikes and a long,
      thick haft that only barely counterbalances its weight. If your Strength
      is less than 19 (or 17 for a Small or smaller butchering axe), you take a
      -2 penalty on attacks with it, as you're unable to maneuver its daunting
      size and weight.</p>
