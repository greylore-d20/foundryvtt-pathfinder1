Good and lawful creatures instinctively distrust you, and you take a â€“4 penalty on all Diplomacy checks against such creatures. You gain a +2 bonus on all Bluff and Intimidate checks. Diplomacy is not a class skill for you, but Bluff or Intimidate (choose one) is.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you gain a +4 bonus to all saving throws against fear effects.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you gain immunity to poison.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, any weapon you wield is treated as chaotic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.</p>"
