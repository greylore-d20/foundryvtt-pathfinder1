  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You step into the Ethereal Plane long enough to dodge a blow or
      confound a spell; you must cast <i>ether step</i> after you are targeted
      by an attack or effect but before you learn the results of the attack or
      effect. This spell functions as <i>ethereal jaunt</i>, except that you
      become ethereal until the beginning of your next turn. On the turn after
      you cast this spell and return to your starting point, you can take only
      move actions or free actions.</p>
