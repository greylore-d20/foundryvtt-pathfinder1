  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes an object to radiate <i>darkness</i> out to a 20-foot
      radius. This <i>darkness</i> causes the illumination level in the area to
      drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim
      light, or from dim light to <i>darkness</i>. This spell has no effect in
      an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or
      sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain
      concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total
      concealment (50% miss chance) in <i>darkness</i>.</p><p>Creatures with
      darkvision can see in an area of dim light or <i>darkness</i> without
      penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not
      increase the light level in an area of <i>darkness</i>. Magical light
      sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher
      spell level than <i>darkness</i>.</p><p>If <i>darkness</i> is cast on a
      small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering,
      the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.</p><p>This
      spell does not stack with itself. <i>Darkness</i> can be used to counter
      or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.</p>
