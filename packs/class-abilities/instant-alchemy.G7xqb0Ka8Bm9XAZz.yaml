    value: >-
      <p>At 18th level, an alchemist can create alchemical items with almost
      supernatural speed. He can create any alchemical item as a full-round
      action if he succeeds at the Craft (alchemy) check and has the appropriate
      resources at hand to fund the creation. He can apply poison to a weapon as
      an immediate action.</p>
