      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.pq9cw2n3i359oj1f]{scale spikes}, except
      that the spikes growing out of the scales have an enhancement bonus on
      attack and damage rolls equal to +1 for every 4 caster levels (maximum
      +5). This bonus does not allow the spikes to bypass damage reduction aside
      from magic.</p>
