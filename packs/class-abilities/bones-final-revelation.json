If you are brought to below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize. You can cast animate dead at will without paying a material component cost (although you are still subject to the usual Hit Die control limit). Once per day, you can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.51ob5y7phwlhcuzz]{Power Word Kill}, but the spell can target a creature with 150 hit points or less.</p>"
