  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian can continually replenish her health. At the start of her
      turn, she regains 1 temporary hit point for every 4 levels she has (up to
      5 hit points per round), but this cannot give her more than her maximum
      temporary hit points from rage.</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>

      <p>Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A barbarian can’t have
      more than one stance rage power active at a time. If she activates a
      stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance
      immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning
      of the barbarian’s turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the
      rage ends.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
