      <p>You infuse a weapon with faint but pernicious energy that stymies
      accelerated healing. Damage dealt by the weapon or ammunition is treated
      as acid, cold, electricity, and fire, but only for the purpose of negating
      a creature's regeneration. The weapon is also treated as silver and cold
      iron at 8th level and is treated as chaotic, evil, good, and lawful at
      11th level for the purpose of negating regeneration.</p>
