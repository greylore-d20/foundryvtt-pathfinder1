    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, for 1 round as a swift action, you can ignore impediments
      to your mobility and effects that cause paralysis (as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.lvzq2mwkqmozolpl]{Freedom of Movement}). You can
      activate this blessing even if you’re otherwise unable to take actions,
      but not if you’re unconscious.</p>
