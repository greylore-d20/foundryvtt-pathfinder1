      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><b>Damage</b> 1d8 (small), 1d10 (medium);
      <b>Critical</b> 19-20/x2; <b>Range</b> 120 ft.; <b>Type</b>
      P</p><p><b>Weapon Groups</b> Crossbows</p><h3>Description</h3><p>You draw
      a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow
      is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A heavy
      crossbow fires crossbow bolts.</p><p>Normally, operating a heavy crossbow
      requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow
      with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy
      crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if
      attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the
      penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
