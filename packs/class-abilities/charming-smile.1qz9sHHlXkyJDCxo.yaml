  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.tjog6bufg5b08lvq]{Charm Person} as a swift action,
      with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. You can
      only have one creature charmed in this way at a time. The total number of
      rounds of this effect per day is equal to your cleric level. The rounds do
      not need to be consecutive, and you can dismiss the charm at any time as a
      free action. Each attempt to use this ability consumes 1 round of its
      duration, whether or not the creature succeeds on its save to resist the
      effect.</p>
