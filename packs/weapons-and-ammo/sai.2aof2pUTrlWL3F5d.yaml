  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A sai is a metal spike flanked by a pair of prongs used to trap an
      enemy's weapon. When wielding a sai, you get a +2 bonus on combat maneuver
      checks to sunder an enemy's weapon. Though pointed, a sai is not usually
      used for stabbing. Instead, it is used primarily to bludgeon foes,
      punching with the hilt, or else to catch and disarm weapons between its
      tines. Sais are often wielded in pairs.</p>
