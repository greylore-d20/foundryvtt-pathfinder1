    value: >-
      <p>The target's buoyancy becomes and stays swiftly sinking, regardless of
      how dense the target and its gear are. Among other effects, the target can
      walk on the bottom, but she also needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to
      swim towards the surface and to stay above the bottom (see Buoyancy on
      page 43). This makes <i>lead anchor</i> a useful spell both for exploring
      the sea floor and for drowning an air-breathing foe in the water.</p>
