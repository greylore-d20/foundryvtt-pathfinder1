  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch
      a creature to alter its size. You can increase or decrease the creature’s
      size by one step, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.jnlr9cuepka1l26e]{Enlarge
      Person} or @Compendium[pf1.spells.2y9e1l6zso9tdg0a]{Reduce Person} but not
      limited by the creature’s type.</p>

      <p>If the creature is hostile toward you, using this ability requires a
      successful melee touch attack, and the creature can attempt a Fortitude
      save to negate the effect.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess.</p>

      <p>You can’t use this ability on a creature that is already subject to an
      effect that alters its size.</p>
