      <p>You make the affected subjects ready for battle despite their fear. If
      a target is suffering from a fear effect of any kind, he gains a +2 morale
      bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a
      -2 penalty to AC.</p><p>If the subject is frightened, he remains in place
      and gains the confused condition for the remainder of the fear effect,
      except he treats all results of "attack self " as "do nothing" and treats
      "attack nearest creature" as "act normally." If the subject is panicked,
      he remains in place and gains the confused condition for the duration of
      the fear effect.</p>
