      <h3>Description</h3><p>These carefully crafted wooden bolts have a hollow
      core filled with alchemist's fire. On a successful hit, they deal normal
      damage plus 1d4 points of fire damage. Alchemical fire bolts do not cause
      any splash damage, and the fire burst isn't enough to ignite targets
      (unless they are particularly flammable).</p>
