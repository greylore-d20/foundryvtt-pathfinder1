  shortDescription: >-
    <p>When you cast this spell, a spectral force binds a broken weapon
    together, relieving the broken condition for a short time. While under the
    effects of this spell, an item with the broken condition suffers no adverse
    effects from that condition, and is treated as if it is not broken. The
    object regains no hit points, and damage can still destroy the object.</p>
