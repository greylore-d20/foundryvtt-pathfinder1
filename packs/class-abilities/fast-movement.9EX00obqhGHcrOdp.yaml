  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The character’s land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10
      feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no <em>armor</em>,
      light <em>armor</em>, or medium <em>armor</em>, and not carrying a heavy
      load. Apply this bonus before modifying the character’s speed because of
      any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses
      to the character’s land speed.</p>
