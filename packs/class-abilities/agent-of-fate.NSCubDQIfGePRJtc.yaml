      <p>At 8th level, when you use your augury spell-like ability, you gain a
      benefit that lasts until the end of your next combat. If the result was
      “weal,” all curing effects used on you cure an additional +1d10 hit
      points. If the result was “woe,” your melee attacks deal an additional
      +1d6 points of damage. If the result is “weal and woe” or “nothing,” you
      gain a +2 insight bonus to your Armor Class.</p>
