      <p>You become a Medium chromatic or metallic dragon (see the
      <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>). You gain a +4 size bonus to Strength, a
      +2 size bonus to Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, fly 60 feet
      (poor), darkvision 60 feet, a breath weapon, and resistance to one
      element. You also gain one bite (1d8), two claws (1d6), and two wing
      attacks (1d4). Your breath weapon and resistance depend on the type of
      dragon. You can only use the breath weapon once per casting of this spell.
