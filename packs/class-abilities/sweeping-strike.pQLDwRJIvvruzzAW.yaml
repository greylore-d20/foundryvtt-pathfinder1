      <p>The vigilante gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.Zeq6RWYv5otvg8q7]{Cleave} as
      a bonus feat.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, he gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.6HSMdwX1VS6nZ6Zf]{Great
      Cleave} as a bonus feat. He does not need to meet the prerequisites for
      these feats.</p>

      <p>At 12th level, while using Great Cleave, he no longer has to hit a
      target in order to make an additional attack against a foe that is
      adjacent to that target.</p>

      <p>Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.</p>
