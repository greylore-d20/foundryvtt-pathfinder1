    value: >-
      <p>You cause sheets of hot sand to spread over the ground in the area of
      effect. This layer of sand is 1 foot deep and constantly shifts and
      churns, transforming the ground in the area into difficult terrain. The
      sand itself burns, and periodic flames rise from the grit. While these
      flames cannot ignite objects, they deal 1d4 points of fire damage to any
      creature that ends its turn in contact with the ground within the area of
      effect. At the end of the duration, the sand vanishes, leaving no
      aftereffects (other than damage dealt).</p>
