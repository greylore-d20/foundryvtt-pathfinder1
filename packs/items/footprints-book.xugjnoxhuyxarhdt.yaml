      <p>This 50-page tome contains accurate drawings of various common
      <em>animal</em>, <em>humanoid</em>, and monster tracks, as well as notes
      on stride length, tread depth, and similarly useful information. The book
      gives you a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> to identify a creature by its
      tracks, though the use of shoes makes identifying many <em>humanoids</em>
      difficult or impossible. Though the book can't help you identify unique
      individuals, it can help you tell an <em>ogre</em> footprint from a
      <em>troll</em> footprint, or an <em>elf's</em> track from an
      <em>orc's</em>. Books sold in different areas may have different
      footprints, depending on what creatures are common to that location.</p>
