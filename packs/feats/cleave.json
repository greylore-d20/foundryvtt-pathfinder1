If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.<p><b>Combat Trick</b><br>When using the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you can spend 4 stamina points to negate the -2 penalty to Armor Class until your next turn."
