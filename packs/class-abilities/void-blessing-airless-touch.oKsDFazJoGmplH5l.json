If the target fails at a Fortitude saving throw, it’s also staggered for 1 round as it catches its breath. If the target was attempting to hold its breath, it can no longer do so: it must breathe on its turn or risk suffocation and unconsciousness.</p>\n<p>Creatures that don’t need to breathe are unaffected.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether it succeeds at its saving throw, the target is immune to further uses of your airless touch for 24 hours.</p>"
