      <p>This variant of <i>planar binding</i> is specifically used to call one
      of the most knowledgeable types of outsiders: the immortal and prophetic
      caulborn (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3</i> 48). This spell calls a single
      caulborn into a specially prepared trap. The caster of this spell can
      compel a bound caulborn only to provide information (using its Knowledge
      skills or <i>detect</i> thoughts); attempts to compel the caulborn to
      fight, guard a location, or perform some other task automatically fail. 
      This spell otherwise functions as <i>planar binding</i>. The most
      effective gifts for a caulborn are unique books or intelligent creatures
      upon whose thoughts the caulborn can feed. The true names of caulborn are
      nearly impossible to discover, as they are not inherently individualistic,
      but certain reclusive scholar communities in Kaer Maga may know titles by
      which specific caulborn can be called.</p>
