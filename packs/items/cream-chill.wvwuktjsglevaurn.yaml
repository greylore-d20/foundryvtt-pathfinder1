      <p>This sticky light blue paste grows pleasantly cool to the touch
      whenever it is exposed to light. Spreading a dose on your face and hands
      takes a full-round action and grants you a +2 alchemical bonus on saves to
      resist hot weather. In areas of bright light this bonus increases to +4,
      while in areas of dim light or darkness it is negated. A dose of chill
      cream lasts for 1 hour after being applied. A newly crafted bottle of
      chill cream holds 5 doses.</p>
