    value: >-
      <p><b>Element</b> aether; <b>Type</b> utility (Su); <b>Level</b> 9;
      <b>Burn</b> 0</p>

      <p>You can spin a small building, bridge, or other edifice out of aether,
      and even use aether to tether a building to a flat surface other than the
      ground. By concentrating for 10 minutes, you can create an edifice out of
      scintillating aether (same hardness and hit points as a wall of force) as
      long as the edifice is no larger than one 10-foot cube per kineticist
      level. Unless the creation is extremely simplistic, you must succeed at a
      Craft or Knowledge (engineering) check to add embellishments.</p>

      <p>This ability can also create a series of tethers to securely attach a
      normal building to a vertical surface or even a cavern ceiling. Aether
      architect lasts as long as you concentrate, and you can accept 1 point of
      burn to make the effect last until destroyed; by accepting this burn, you
      can use this ability any number of times in a row to create a larger
      edifice.</p>
