      <p>This <em>bandolier</em> holds six pouches along its length and a
      satchel at the hip. Each pouch has a stiff leather flap that can be
      secured against jostling with a clasp (requiring a <em>move action</em> to
      open or close) or left unfastened for easier access. The pouches and
      satchel contain loops and ties for securing additional
      equipment.</p><p>The sash buckles at the shoulder, and in an emergency can
      be freed with a sharp tug as a <em>move action</em>.</p>
