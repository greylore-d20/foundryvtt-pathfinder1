You gain a +5 alchemical bonus on saving throws against poison, as if you were always under the effect of antitoxin. You can use the treat poison action from the Heal skill as a standard action with a mere touch, without a healer’s kit, and even on yourself; if you succeed, you grant the touched creature a +5 alchemical bonus against that specific instance of poison in addition to the normal +4 bonus from treat poison.</p>\n<p>You can accept 1 point of burn while using the treat poison action in this way to also produce the effects of @Compendium[pf1.spells.6l904edkt8jv9jor]{Neutralize Poison}.</p>"
