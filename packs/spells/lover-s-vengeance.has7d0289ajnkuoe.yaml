  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You inspire yourself or a lover to a vengeful <i>rage</i> against a
    chosen enemy, who must be a creature that has wronged you in some way. If
    cast on you, the next time you are in combat with that enemy, you gain the
    benefits of a <i>rage</i> spell. If cast on a lover, he or she gains the
    benefits of a <i>rage</i> spell the next time the lover is in combat against
    your enemy. This variant of the spell must be cast within 1 hour of an
    intimate encounter with the target. The <i>rage</i> effect lasts 1 round per
    level. If the creature that triggers the <i>rage</i> effect is one of your
    lovers or ex-lovers, the benefits granted by the <i>rage</i> spell double.
    This spell counts as a <i>contingency</i> spell on the target for the
    purpose of multiple contingent effects. Worshipers of Calistria are fond of
    using this spell, and many keep the effect running whenever possible.</p>
