      <p>Legend claims runelords used this spell to literally benefit from
      drinking the tears of their captured foes. This spell turns nonmagic
      liquids-including spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise
      contaminated drinks, tears, seawater, and similar fluids-into mead or wine
      of average quality. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay
      or spoilage. Unholy water and similar liquids of significance are spoiled
      by <i>Tears to Wine</i>, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any
      type or on magic potions.  Creatures that drink the mead or wine created
      by this spell become sharp-witted and clear-minded, gaining a +2
      enhancement bonus on all Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks. This
      increases to a +5 bonus at caster level 9th, and to +10 (the maximum) at
      caster level 15th.</p>
