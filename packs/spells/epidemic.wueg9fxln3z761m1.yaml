      <p>The target contracts one of the following diseases: blinding sickness,
      bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache,
      shakes, or slimy doom (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 557), as the spell
      <i>contagion</i>. However, the disease is highly contagious, and any
      creature that touches the infected target, is touched by the target, or
      spends more than an hour in a confined space with the target must make a
      save against the disease's normal DC (not the spell DC) or contract the
      disease. If the initial target overcomes the disease by making the
      required number of saving throws, it remains a carrier of the disease for
      a length of time equal to the disease's frequency, and can continue to
      infect others during this time.</p>
