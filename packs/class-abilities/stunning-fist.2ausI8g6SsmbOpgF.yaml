    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, the monk gains
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.GsjouI6B8X7BA5wN]{Stunning Fist} as a bonus feat,
      even if he does not meet the prerequisites. The monk may attempt a
      stunning attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus
      one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than
      monk.</p><p>At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains
      the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his <em>Stunning
      Fist</em>. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a
      successful <em>saving throw</em> still negates the effect.</p><p>At 4th
      level, he can choose to make the target <em>fatigued</em>.</p><p>At 8th
      level, he can make the target <em>sickened</em> for 1 minute.</p><p>At
      12th level, he can make the target <em>staggered</em> for 1d6+1
      rounds.</p><p>At 16th level, he can permanently <em>blind</em> or
      <em>deafen</em> the target.</p><p>At 20th level, he can <em>paralyze</em>
      the target for 1d6+1 rounds.</p><p>The monk must choose which condition
      will apply before the <em>attack roll</em> is made. These effects do not
      stack with themselves (a creature <em>sickened</em> by <em>Stunning
      Fist</em> cannot become <em>nauseated</em> if hit by <em>Stunning
      Fist</em> again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>
