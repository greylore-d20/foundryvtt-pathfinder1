  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire.</p><p>This
    spell functions like <i>greater magic weapon</i>, except that it subtly
    alters the physical properties of a weapon, enabling it to bypass damage
    reduction of one the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, piercing,
    silver, or slashing. The affected weapon still inflicts damage of its normal
    type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged. This spell can be cast
    on a natural weapon or unarmed strike.</p>
