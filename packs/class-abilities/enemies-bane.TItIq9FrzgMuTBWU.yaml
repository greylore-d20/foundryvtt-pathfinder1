  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, the shaman imbues a single weapon sheâ€™s wielding
      with the bane weapon special ability, choosing the type of creature
      affected each time she does. The effect lasts for 1 minute. If the weapon
      already has the bane weapon special ability of the type chosen, the
      additional damage dealt by bane increases to 4d6.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      her Charisma modifier.</p>
