Whenever an enemy makes a melee attack against the cavalier or one of his adjacent slaves or servants, that enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier, and the cavalier gains a +2 morale bonus on this attack of opportunity. If the enemy’s attack was a confirmed critical hit, the cavalier counts the enemy as if it were the target of his challenge for this attack of opportunity.</p>"
