    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell increases the virulence of the targeted dose of poison, making the poison more difficult to resist. The poison is unaffected by <i>delay poison</i>, and the DC to remove it with <i>neutralize poison</i> is increased by 5. Additionally, the poison uses its own saving throw DC or <i>overwhelming</i> poison's DC, whichever is higher.  If cast on a creature that is currently suffering from exposure to one or more doses of poison, the spell applies to one of the doses of your choice, or a random dose of poison affecting the target if you don't know what poisons are afflicting the target. If cast on a creature that is venomous, this spell affects the first dose of poison that creature delivers before the end of the spell's duration.</p>"
