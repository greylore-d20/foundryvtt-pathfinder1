    value: >-
      <p>These poisonous bombs clear away foliage, dealing extra damage to plant
      creatures.<p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it
      deal extra damage against plant creatures but less damage against other
      creatures. Against creatures with the plant type, a defoliant bomb deals
      1d8 points of damage, plus 1d8 points of damage for every odd-numbered
      level the alchemist possesses, instead of 1d6. Against all other
      creatures, the defoliant bomb only deals 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4
      points of damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. This is a
      poison effect. A defoliant bomb kills all normal vegetation in the
      target's square and its splash area; any plant-based difficult terrain in
      the affected area becomes normal terrain.</p>
