  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This scabbard is an improvised weapon designed to allow you to remove
      it from your belt as a swift action when drawing the weapon it contains.
      Taking the Equipment Trick feat (see page 22) for a scabbard gives you
      additional combat options for using a scabbard. For the purpose of fighter
      weapon groups, a scabbard for a heavy blade is considered a hammer, and a
      scabbard for a light blade is considered a close weapon.</p>
