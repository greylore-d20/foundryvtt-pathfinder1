  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target creature begins sweating a foul liquid that makes it
      repugnant to most living creatures. When a creature deals damage to the
      affected creature with a bite attack or the swallow whole ability, it must
      succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become nauseated until the end of
      its next turn. After a creature has become nauseated by this spell, each
      subsequent failed saving throw against the spell instead gives it the
      sickened condition until the end of its next turn.</p>
