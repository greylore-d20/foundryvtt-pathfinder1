  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You pin the target's shadow to its current location, causing the target
    to become entangled and preventing it from moving farther than 5 feet from
    its original position, as if its shadow were anchored to the terrain. Each
    round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the
    effect as a full-round action. A flying creature can only hover in place or
    fall while entangled in this manner. This spell automatically fails when
    cast on a creature that doesn't throw a shadow, and it ends if the creature
    is entirely in an area with no illumination.</p>
