  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By casting <i>zone of silence</i>, you manipulate sound waves in your
      immediate vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area can
      converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices or any other
      noises from within, including language-dependent or sonic spell effects.
      This effect is centered on you and moves with you.</p><p>Anyone who enters
      the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave
      are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful DC 20 Linguistics
      check to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a <i>zone of
      silence</i>.</p>
