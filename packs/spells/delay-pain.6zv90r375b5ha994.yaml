    value: >-
      <p>You override the target's ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.jy64xofud29j5ju6]{pain strike} and
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.k6nfhf1wvik082wu]{symbol of pain}) do not
      affect the target until this spell's duration has expired. This does not
      negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain
      effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain
      while the spell lasts.</p>
