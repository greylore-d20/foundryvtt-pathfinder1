      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monkâ€™s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.<br><br>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects.</p>\n<p>A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as he gains levels.<br><br>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>"
