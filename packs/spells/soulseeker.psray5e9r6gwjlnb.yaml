  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You identify the stage of a given soul's judgment, or determine its fate
    post-judgment. You must either unambiguously identify  the soul you seek or
    use the skull of the body the soul vacated as a focus. If the subject does
    not share your alignment, the soul can attempt a Will save to resist this
    spell's effects as if it were still alive. If the subject is still alive or
    its soul has been destroyed, this spell fails without providing any
    information.  If the soul has not yet been judged and moved on to its final
    reward or punishment, <i>soulseeker</i> provides an estimate of its
    location; in most cases, this is somewhere in the River of Souls or the
    Boneyard. While this may assist in physically traveling to the soul's
    location, especially in cases involving effects such as <i>soul bind</i> or
    a devourer's devour soul ability, the spell's primary purpose is to identify
    how long the subject has been dead (and what form of life-restoring magic is
    necessary). If the soul has already been judged, <i>soulseeker</i> instead
    identifies the plane to which the soul has been sent as a petitioner and the
    petitioner's general location on that plane (such as "Elysium, beneath the
    boughs of the Witchwood").  If <i>soulseeker</i> is cast on the same plane
    on which the soul's new petitioner form currently exists, it guides you
    along the shortest, most direct physical route to the petitioner, as
    described in <i>find the path</i>. In this case, the spell's duration is 1
    hour per level.</p>
