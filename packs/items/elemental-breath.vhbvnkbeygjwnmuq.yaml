    value: >-
      <p>This vial at first seems to be empty, but when it's opened, a rush of
      wind issues forth from within. When elemental breath is inhaled (as
      drinking a <em>potion</em>) by an air-breathing creature, that creature
      does not need to breath air for 10 rounds. A vial of elemental breath must
      be inhaled on the round it was opened to gain this effect. If it is not,
      the item is wasted.</p>
