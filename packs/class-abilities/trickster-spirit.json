      "value": "<p><em>A trickster spirit is a savvy and manipulative master of skills.</em><br><br><strong>Spirit Bonus: </strong>When you channel a trickster, your spirit bonus applies on Dexterity checks, skill checks, and Reflex saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Seance Boon: </strong>Choose one skill when you gain this seance boon. You gain a +1 bonus on skill checks using that skill, and that skill counts as a class skill for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations: </strong>Alleys, mazes, taverns, trap-filled locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Influence Penalty: </strong>The trickster within you is a protean manipulator, and you begin to see the possibility that everyone around you might have ulterior motives as well. You never count as an ally for the purpose of gaining benefits from another creature’s abilities, nor do you count as a willing target for spells. Anyone attempting to target you with a touch range spell, even a beneficial spell, must succeed at a melee touch attack, though you need not attempt saving throws against harmless spells. You gain no benefit from another creature’s aid another attempts, as you are too busy making sure they aren’t secretly tricking or sabotaging you.</p>\n<p><strong>Taboos: </strong>Choose one: you can’t abide revealing your true identity, and you break this taboo when anyone pierces your disguise, even your own allies; you can never tell the truth; you can never pass up a more lucrative offer, even if it causes you to switch sides.</p>"
