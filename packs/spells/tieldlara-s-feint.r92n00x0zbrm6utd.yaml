    value: >-
      <p>With a lascivious wink and a sensuous sway, you flood a foe's mind with
      lustful thoughts of you, distracting your target and rendering that
      creature vulnerable to your attacks. An affected creature takes a penalty
      equal to half your caster level on concentration checks and to its CMD
      against dirty trickAPG, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers you perform.
      The creature is also denied its Dexterity bonus to AC for the first melee
      attack you make against it each round. If the target would not normally be
      sexually attracted to you, it receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw. If
      you end your turn more than 20 feet from the target or end your turn where
      your target cannot see you, this spell immediately ends.</p>
