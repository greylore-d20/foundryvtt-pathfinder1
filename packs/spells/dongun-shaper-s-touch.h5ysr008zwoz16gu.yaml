  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an alchemical residue on your hands that allows you to
      reshape any nonmagical, unattended object with  hardness 19 or less as
      though it were clay. Objects with hardness 9 or less are like soft clay,
      allowing you to reshape up to 1 cubic foot per round of effort. Objects
      with hardness 10 or higher are harder to mold, allowing you to reshape up
      to 1/4 cubic foot per round. The object retains its new shape for 24 hours
      before returning to its original shape. This spell does not allow you to
      reshape a portion of a large object, such as a wall; you must be able to
      reshape the entire target within the spell's duration or the spell fizzles
      and has no effect.</p>
