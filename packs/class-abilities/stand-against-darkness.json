      "value": "<p>At 15th level, the cavalier can take revenge on undead that dare strike him or those he seeks to protect. Whenever an undead creature that is the subject of his challenge hits the cavalier or an adjacent ally with a melee attack, the creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks of opportunity provoked as a result of this ability. If an undead subject of the cavalierâ€™s challenge threatens a critical hit against the cavalier, the cavalier gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier against the confirmation roll. This bonus functions as a supernatural ability.</p>"
