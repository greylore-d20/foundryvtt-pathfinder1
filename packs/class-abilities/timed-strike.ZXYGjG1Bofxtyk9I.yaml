      <p>The longer the investigator studies his opponent, the greater the
      damage he ultimately deals with his studied strike. When the investigator
      makes a studied strike, he deal a number of points of additional damage
      equal to the number of consecutive rounds he studied the target with
      studied combat.</p>
