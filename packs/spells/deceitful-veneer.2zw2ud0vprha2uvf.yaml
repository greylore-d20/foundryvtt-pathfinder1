      <p>You subtly alter both the target's aura and subtle cues in its body
      language, tone of voice, and word choice, which makes everything that the
      target says seem to be a lie. Every statement that the target makes
      appears to be a lie under both magical scrutiny (such as <i>discern</i>
      lies) and mundane scrutiny (such as using the Sense Motive skill). Someone
      who closely scrutinizes the target can determine when it is actually
      telling the truth with a successful Sense Motive check (DC = 15 + your
      caster level).  As long as you are within close range of the target, as a
      standard action you can suppress or resume the effects of this spell,
      allowing you to let the target seem to be telling the truth at some times
      and still seem to be lying at others.</p>
