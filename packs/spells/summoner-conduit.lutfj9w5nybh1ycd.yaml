      <p>You exploit the invisible, mystic connection between the target
      creature and its summoner to harm that summoner. Whenever the target's
      summoned creature is the target of a spell that deals damage, the target's
      summoner is also considered to be a target of that spell. Such a summoner
      gains his normal defenses against the spell, such as a saving throw and
      spell resistance, and cannot be affected if he is on another plane of
      existence.</p>
