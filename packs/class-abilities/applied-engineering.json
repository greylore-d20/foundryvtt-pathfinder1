He can expend one use of inspiration as a full-round action to study an object or area and attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check. On his next turn, he can use the result of that Knowledge (engineering) check in place of a Strength check to break the object or in place of a Perception check to locate hidden doors or compartments in that area.</p>"
