      <p>At 8th level, as a standard action, you can give life to inanimate
      objects. This ability functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.k9iu3d82hlo7coct]{Animate Objects} using your
      cleric level as the caster level. You can use this ability once per day at
      8th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond
      8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Dancing Weapon power of the Artifice
      Domain.</p>
