    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you can invoke a howling windstorm around yourself as a
      standard action. For 1 minute, any Large or smaller creature takes twice
      as much movement to enter a space adjacent to you due to the winds, and
      thus canâ€™t take a 5-foot step to move adjacent to you.</p>
