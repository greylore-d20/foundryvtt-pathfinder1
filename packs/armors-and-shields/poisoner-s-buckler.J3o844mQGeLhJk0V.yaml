    value: >-
      <p>Half-drow make these bucklers to allow for quick application of exactly
      the right poison in the middle of combat. This mithral buckler is painted
      black with three deep grooves running over the surface, each fitted with a
      slot that can hold a vial of poison. As a move action, the user can swipe
      a weapon over the surface of the buckler, coating it with a single dose of
      poison. The buckler can hold 3 doses of poison. If the wearer does not
      have the poison use ability, she faces the standard risk of poisoning
      herself</p>
