  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per round while raging, whenever the barbarian makes an attack
      against a construct, she can ignore an amount of that constructâ€™s hardness
      equal to her barbarian level. This ability must be used before the attack
      roll is made.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the smasher rage power before selecting this rage
      power. This power stacks with <a
