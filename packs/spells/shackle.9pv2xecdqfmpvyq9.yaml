      <p>You summon a set of Small or Medium masterwork restraints into being.
      When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are
      manacles or fetters (manacles specifically designed to fit around the
      ankles). You also summon the restraints' key to your person; the Disable
      Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 + your caster level
      + the modifier of your primary casting ability score. Typically, the
      restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell's casting,
      you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and
      the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell's DC, the
      locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you
      and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the
      target's limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a
      full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures
      you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail
      their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the
      targets together. As you increase in level, the restraints become stronger
      and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you
      can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large
      restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or
      Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a
      material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once
      during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints
      as per <i>dimensional anchor</i> with a duration of 1 minute per caster
      level. If you are 18th level or higher and use an emerald worth at least
      1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, the restraints'
      hardness increases to 30, they have 60 hit points, and they can't be
      broken with a successful Strength check. (The emerald must be worth at
      least 2,000 gp if you also wish to use the <i>dimensional anchor</i>
      effect described earlier.) If you cast this spell before the duration of a
      previous casting has lapsed, you can create a new set of restraints or
      reset the previous spell's duration. If you used an expensive material
      component during a previous casting, you must again use a component when
      creating new restraints or resetting the duration if you wish to maintain
      the special effect. You do not need to touch these previously created
      shackles to renew their duration, though you must be on the same plane as
      the shackles. When this spell ends, the restraints disappear, and any
      ongoing effects created by the spell end.</p>
