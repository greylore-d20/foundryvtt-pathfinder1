    value: >-
      <p>The body of the target creature twists and distorts, reshaping into a
      grotesque figure. Because of the disfigurement, the creature takes a â€“4
      penalty to Constitution and Charisma. The creature also receives one of
      the following deformities (your choice) from the list in the mutant
      acquired template: blind, deaf, fragile, fractured mind, lame, poor
      ability (applied to your choice of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or
      Wisdom), spasms, and useless arm. The deformity is subject to all
      limitations described in the
      @Compendium[pf1.monster-templates.4pbHKe1aYEcjBEs4]{mutant} template (for
      example, this spell cannot impose the lame deformity on a creature with a
      base speed slower than 20 feet).</p>
