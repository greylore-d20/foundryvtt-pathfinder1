      leather cup attached to a pair of strings. Your Strength modifier applies
      to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons.
      You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a
      move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of
      opportunity.</p><p>A sling fires sling bullets. You can hurl ordinary
      stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets.
      Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a
      creature one size category smaller than you and you take a -1 penalty on
      attack rolls.</p>
