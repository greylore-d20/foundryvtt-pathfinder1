      <p>You link your senses to the target, allowing you to see and hear
      through its eyes and ears. As a move action you can shift your senses from
      yourself to the target or back again. When using the target's senses, you
      are blind and deaf. When perceiving through the target, you use its normal
      and special senses (such as darkvision), not your own.</p>
