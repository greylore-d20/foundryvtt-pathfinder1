    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions as <i>teleport</i>, except you use it to <i>teleport</i> yourself or one other creature to a safe location you specify (the target can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed the target's heavy load). You can only send the target to a location with which you are very familiar. The target is first trapped in ice (hardness 0, 3 hit points per inch of thickness, 1 inch thick per caster level) for 1d4 rounds, during which time it is paralyzed, aware but unable to take any physical actions, and begins to fade away as the <i>teleport</i>ation aspect takes effect. At the end of the 1d4 rounds, the target <i>teleport</i>s to the specified location, and the ice's hit points drop to 0 and it quickly melts away. If the ice is destroyed before the target <i>teleport</i>s, the spell ends and the <i>teleport</i> doesn't occur.</p>",
