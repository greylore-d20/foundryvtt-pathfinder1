    value: >-
      <p>The witch curses a target with clumsiness when in dangerous terrain.
      The target takes a –4 penalty on Acrobatics checks to move over slippery
      or uneven surfaces and to avoid attacks of opportunity while moving
      through threatened squares. This effect lasts for 1 minute. On a
      successful Will save, the penalty is reduced by half and the duration is
      only 1 round.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, this penalty increases to –8.</p>
