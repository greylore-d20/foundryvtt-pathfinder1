      <p>The target gains the ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30
      feet. This swim speed means the target also gains the standard +8 bonus on
      Swim checks and the ability to take 10 on Swim checks even while
      distracted or endangered. The target can use the run action while
      swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. The spell does not make
      the target unable to breathe air.</p>
