    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent with a spell that
      requires an attack roll, you may immediately attempt to trip your opponent
      as a swift action. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity as normal
      for this trip attempt. You cannot be tripped in return when using this
      ability.</p>
