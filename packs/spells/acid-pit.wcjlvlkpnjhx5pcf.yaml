      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.8w67l6dzzsi6oz5f]{create pit}, except
      that it places a 5-footdeep pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit
      has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit take
      falling damage as normal (the acid counts as a yielding surface), plus 2d6
      points of acid damage per round spent in contact with the acid. In
      addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may be harmed.
      Refer to Table 9-2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks (Core Rulebook 216).
      Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and
      must make Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain
      the broken condition. Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how
      they became broken) must make a Fortitude saving throw each round spent
      within the acid or be destroyed. The walls of the pit are quite slippery
      and have a Climb DC of 30.</p>
