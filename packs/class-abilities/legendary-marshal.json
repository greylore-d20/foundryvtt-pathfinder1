This lesser surge adds a maximum of 1d6 to the roll and does not apply your spirit bonus, regardless of other effects or abilities you have that alter your spirit surge. A lesser surge still counts as a spirit surge for the purpose of the limit of one spirit surge per round, but it does not consume any free uses of spirit surge you may have from effects such as taboo.</p>"
