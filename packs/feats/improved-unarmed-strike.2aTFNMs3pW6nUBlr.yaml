    value: >-
      <i>You are skilled at fighting while unarmed.</i>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>You are considered to be armed even when unarmed â€” you do not provoke
      attacks of opportunity when you attack foes while unarmed. Your unarmed
      strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage, at your choice.</p>

      <p><b>Normal</b></p>

      <p>Without this feat, you are considered unarmed when attacking with an
      unarmed strike, and you can deal only nonlethal damage with such an
      attack.</p>
