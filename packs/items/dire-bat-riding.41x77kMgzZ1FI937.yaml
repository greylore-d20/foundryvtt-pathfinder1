      <p>These feral beasts are all but untamable, and are typically only sought
      out by violent brawlers or cruel lords, either for brutish protection or
      to pit against equally vicious creatures in violent animal fights. At the
      GM's discretion, PCs who acquire dire animals may be required to attempt
      wild empathy or Handle Animal checks every day to keep their pets from
      running away or attacking them and their allies. Dire animals are not
      generally suitable as mounts, though the GM may make exceptions at her
      discretion.Considered to be the fastest nonmagical transport in cavernous
      underground realms, dire bats (<em>Bestiary 30</em>) are domesticated in
      captivity to serve as riding animals. Stables that accommodate these
      massive creatures are only commonly found in cities built in larger
      underground caverns, owing to the greater space required for training and
      exercise, though the outriders of some subterranean races fly them almost
      to the surface. These creatures require exotic saddles to ride.</p>
