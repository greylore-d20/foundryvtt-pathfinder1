  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These short, slender blades are between 1 to 2 feet long. They are
      primarily used as back-up weapons, to decapitate defeated enemies, or to
      commit seppuku (ritual suicide) as a matter of honor. These blades are
      specifically worn by samurai and are intended to be paired with a katana.
      Together, this set of blades is referred to as a daisho.</p>
