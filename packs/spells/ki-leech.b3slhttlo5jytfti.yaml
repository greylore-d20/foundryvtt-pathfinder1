  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a critical
    hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit
    points, you can steal some of that creature's <i>ki</i>. This replenishes 1
    point of <i>ki</i> as long as you have at least 1 <i>ki</i> point in your
    <i>ki</i> pool. This does not allow you to exceed your <i>ki</i> pool's
    maximum. This ability does not stack with similar abilities (such as the
    steal <i>ki</i> ability of the hungry ghost monk in the Advanced Player's
    Guide).</p><p>This spell has no effect if you do not have a <i>ki</i>
    pool.</p>
