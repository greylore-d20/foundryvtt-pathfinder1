  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You focus emotional energy and weave it into a shroud of hardened
    ectoplasm around the weapon you touch, infusing it with a ghostly glow and
    great power. The weapon becomes a <i>ghost touch</i> weapon, and gains one
    of the following additional benefits, depending on the type of emotion you 
    infuse into the weapon. If a special ability wouldn't apply to the chosen
    weapon (such as <i>vicious</i> on a ranged weapon), the weapon doesn't gain
    that benefit. <b>Anger</b>: The weapon also gains the <i>vicious</i> special
    ability. <b>Dedication</b>: The weapon also gains the <i>returning</i>
    special ability. <b>Despair</b>: The weapon also gains the cruelUE special
    ability. <b>Fear</b>: The weapon also gains the menacingUE special ability.
    <b>Hatred</b>: The weapon also gains the cunningUE special ability.
    <b>Jealousy</b>: The weapon also gains the mimeticUE special ability.
    <b>Zeal</b>: The weapon also gains the <i>keen</i> special ability.  If you
    are a spiritualist and the type of emotional energy you choose matches the
    emotional focus of your phantom, the weapon grants its wielder a +2 bonus on
    skill checks with both skills you gain Skill Focus in from your phantom's
    emotional focus.</p>
