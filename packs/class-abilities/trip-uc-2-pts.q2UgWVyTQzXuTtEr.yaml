    value: >-
      <p><b>Requirements:</b> Daemon, demon, devil, elemental, or protean
      subtype; bite evolution.</p>

      <p>The eidolon becomes adept at knocking foes to the ground with its bite,
      granting it a trip attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful bite
      attack, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon
      succeeds at this check, the target is knocked prone. If the eidolon fails,
      it is not tripped in return.</p>

      <p>This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or
      smaller than the eidolon.</p>
