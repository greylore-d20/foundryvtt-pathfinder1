  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist becomes bitter in flavor. Any creature that hits the
      bitter alchemist with a bite attack gains the sickened condition for 1
      round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the
      alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Constitution modifier). Any creature
      that swallows the alchemist whole gains the nauseated condition for 1
      round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (same DC as above). If the
      alchemist is trapped in the creature’s gullet and it becomes nauseated,
      the creature vomits him back out immediately as a free action at the start
      of the creature’s turn; the alchemist lands prone adjacent to the
      creature.</p>
