The murky liquid comes enclosed in small packets made of intestine. Mumia and synthetic mumia may be taken interchangeably to stave off the effects of addiction to either substance, and is thus used by some mumia junkies hoping to quit their addiction. Crafting synthetic mumia requires a successful DC 14 Craft (Alchemy) check.</p>\n<h2>Synthetic Mumia</h2>\n<p>Type ingested or injury; Addiction moderate, Fortitude DC 14<br>Price 150 gp<br>Effects 1 hour; +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with the curse or disease descriptor, fatigue<br>Damage 1d2 Wis damage</p>\n<h3>Construction</h3>\n<p>Craft (Alchemy) DC 14</p>"
