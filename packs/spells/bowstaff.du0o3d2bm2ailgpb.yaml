      <p>The bow that is touched takes on the rigidity and toughness of forged
      steel, allowing it to be used as a melee weapon. The spell allows a
      shortbow to be used as a club or a longbow to be used as a quarterstaff,
      although the bow retains its normal hit points and hardness. The bow's
      enhancement bonus, if any, applies on melee attack and damage rolls.
      Additional weapon special weapon qualities also apply to melee attacks if
      such qualities can be added to a melee weapon.</p>
