      <p>As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate
      skill check to make a target act friendly toward you. If you succeed, the
      target assists you normally, but <i>Egorian diplomacy</i> clouds the
      memory of any threats or pressure you applied. The target remembers
      assisting you, but can't remember why, and its attitude toward you doesn't
      worsen as a result of being intimidated.  Whether a creature fails or
      succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes immune to further castings of
      <i>Egorian diplomacy</i> for 24 hours.</p>
