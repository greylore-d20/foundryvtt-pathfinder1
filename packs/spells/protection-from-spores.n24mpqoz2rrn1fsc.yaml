    value: >-
      <p>With a touch, you bolster a creature's body to protect it from the
      harmful effects of spores and similar afflictions. While under the effect
      of this spell, a creature is immune to the effects of brown mold, green
      slime, russet mold, yellow mold, and any similar hazard, provided the
      hazard is CR 6 or lower. Similarly, the creature is immune to poison,
      disease, and infestation attacks from all fungal creatures of CR 6 or
      lower, including  effects such as basidirond spores, violet fungus rot,
      and the like. The target is immune to fungus-based toxins, such as striped
      toadstool. Against similar hazards or monsters of CR 7 or higher, the
      target gains a bonus on all saving throws against the effect equal to half
      your caster level. <i>Protection from Spores</i> offers no protection
      against fungal infestations created by the seeded, by the spell <i>what
      grows within</i>, or by Xhamen-Dor.</p>
