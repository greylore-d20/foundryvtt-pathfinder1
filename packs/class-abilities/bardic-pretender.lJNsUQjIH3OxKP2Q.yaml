  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The character knows enough about music and performance to survive in a
      bardic college and can fake what she doesn’t know. The character qualifies
      as having the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.2M56kfIOws5yYtxq]{inspire
      competence} bardic performance class feature for the purpose of meeting
      prestige class requirements, although this talent doesn’t grant her the
      bardic performance ability.</p>
