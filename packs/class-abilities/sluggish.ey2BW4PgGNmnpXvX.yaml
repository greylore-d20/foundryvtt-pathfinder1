  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes the speed of a creature within 30 feet to be halved.
      The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate this effect. The
      penalty lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s character level
      and does not stack with other effects that reduce speed.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, the creature can’t be the target
      of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
