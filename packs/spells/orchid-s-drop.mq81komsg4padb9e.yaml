    value: >-
      <p>Alchemists have tried for centuries to recreate Artokus Kirran's feat
      of genius that created the <i>sun orchid elixir</i>.</p><p>Although they
      have yet to unlock the elixir's exact formula, their efforts have not been
      entirely wasted. One by-product of their experiments was the orchid's drop
      formula. This extract, distilled from a much-diluted drop of the nectar of
      a sun orchid flower, can transform an alchemist's mutagen into a potent
      healing tonic.</p><p>As long as you're under the effects of orchid's drop,
      drinking a dose of your mutagen heals you of 2d10 points of damage. For
      the spell's duration, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving
      throws.</p>
