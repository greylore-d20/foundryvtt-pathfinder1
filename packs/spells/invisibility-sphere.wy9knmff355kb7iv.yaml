  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>invisibility</i>, except that this spell
    confers <i>invisibility</i> upon all creatures within 10 feet of the
    recipient at the time the spell is cast. The center of the effect is mobile
    with the recipient.</p><p>Those affected by this spell can see each other
    and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving
    out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after
    the spell is cast do not become invisible.</p><p>Affected creatures (other
    than the recipient) who attack negate the <i>invisibility</i> only for
    themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the <i>invisibility</i> sphere
    ends.</p>
