    value: >-
      <p><em>You are skilled at attacking opponents that you cannot clearly
      perceive.</em><p><b>Benefits</b><br>In melee, every time you miss because
      of concealment (see Combat), you can reroll your miss chance percentile
      roll one time to see if you actually hit.<p>An invisible attacker gets no
      advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your
      Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2
      bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply
      for ranged attacks, however.<p>You do not need to make Acrobatics skill
      checks to move at full speed while blinded.<p><b>Normal</b><br>Regular
      attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and
      you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and
      poor visibility also applies.<p><b>Special</b><br>The Blind-Fight feat is
      of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink
      spell.<p><b>Combat Trick</b><br>Once per round, when you hit a creature
      that benefits from concealment, you can spend 2 stamina points to ignore
      the miss chance from that creature's concealment until the end of your
      next turn.</p>
