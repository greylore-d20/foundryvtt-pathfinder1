  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, twice per day, you can use fire to restore the health of
      yourself or your allies. As a standard action, you can wreathe your hand
      in a halo of flame and touch yourself or another creature. The touch heals
      2d8 + your character level points of damage. You can also remove one of
      the following conditions affecting the target: 1d6 points of <em>ability
      damage</em>, <em>blinded</em>, <em>confused</em>, <em>dazzled</em>,
      <em>deafened</em>, diseased, <em>exhausted</em>, <em>fatigued</em>,
      <em>nauseated</em>, poisoned, or <em>sickened</em>. At 20th level, you can
      use this ability three times per day.</p>
