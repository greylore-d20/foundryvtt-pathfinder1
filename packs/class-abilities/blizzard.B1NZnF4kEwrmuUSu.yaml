    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, you can create a savage winter storm centered on you.
      This power acts as @Compendium[pf1.spells.g9koefk7x9szoheo]{Control
      Winds}, but in addition the entire area (not including the “eye” at the
      center of the storm) is affected as a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.qnp4eosajai8s3sf]{Sleet Storm} and all in the area
      are exposed to <em>extreme cold</em>. You may use this ability once per
      day.</p>
