      evil</i>.<p></p><p>If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you
      can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until
      the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete
      the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a
      concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the
      spell ends.</p><p>If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of
      your surroundings or the activities around you while in the
      trance.</p><p>You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in
      the trance. (You always fail Reflex and Will saving throws, for example.)
      Creatures who don't sleep (such as outsiders) or dream are immune to this
      spell.</p>
