      <p>At 4th level, whenever a spiritualist is within the reach of her
      ectoplasmic manifested phantom, she gains a +2 shield bonus to her Armor
      Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on her saving throws. She doesnâ€™t gain
      these bonuses when the ectoplasmic manifested phantom is grappled,
      helpless, or unconscious.</p>

      <p>A spiritualist within 30 feet of her incorporeally manifested phantom
      receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting
      effects. This bonus is a supernatural ability and does not apply if the
      phantom is unconscious.</p>
