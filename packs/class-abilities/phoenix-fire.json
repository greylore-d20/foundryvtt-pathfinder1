At 20th level, while bloodraging, you gain the following effects: your melee attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of fire damage, any enemies within 20 feet of you must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier) or take 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of their turn, and any creature that attacks you with a natural or non-reach weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit.</p>"
