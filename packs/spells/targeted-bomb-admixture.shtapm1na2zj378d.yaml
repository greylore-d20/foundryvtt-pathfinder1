  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a
      significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all
      bombs you create and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on
      your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to
      modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula
      with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you
      drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end
      and the new one becomes active.  When you throw bombs, they can only hit a
      direct target; they do not splash. However, the bomb deals its base damage
      plus double your Intelligence modifier instead of just its base damage
      plus your Intelligence modifier.</p>
