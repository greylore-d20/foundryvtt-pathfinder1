  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With a quick incantation, the shaman causes a creature within 30 feet
      to suffer stiffness in the joints and bones, causing the target to be
      staggered 1 round. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this
      effect.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the duration is increased to a number of rounds equal to
      her shaman level, though the target can attempt a save each round to end
      the effect if its initial saving throw fails.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the target can no longer attempt a saving throw each
      round to end the effect, although it still attempts the initial Fortitude
      saving throw to negate the effect entirely.</p>
