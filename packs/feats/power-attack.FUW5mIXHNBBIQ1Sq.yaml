    value: >-
      <i>You can make exceptionally deadly melee attacks by sacrificing accuracy
      for strength.</i><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Str 13, base attack
      bonus +1.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You can choose to take a -1
      penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +2
      bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased by half
      (+50%) if you are making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed
      weapon using two hands, or a primary natural weapon that adds 1-1/2 times
      your Strength modifier on damage rolls. This bonus to damage is halved
      (-50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary
      natural weapon. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points
      thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the bonus to damage increases
      by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and
      its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to
      touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.</p>
