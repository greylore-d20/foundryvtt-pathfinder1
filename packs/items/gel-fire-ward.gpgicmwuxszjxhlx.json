      "value": "<p><b>Price</b> 150 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>\n<p>When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates a resistant barrier that protects you from fire or heat damage. You gain fire <em>resistance</em> 5. The gel burns away as it absorbs fire damage; when it absorbs a total of 20 points of fire damage, it is discharged. Fire ward gel counts as <em>protection from energy</em> for the purpose of stacking multiple fire protection effects. Applying fire ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. Multiple applications of fire ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose is active merely resets the potential amount of fire damage absorbed to 20 points.</p>"
