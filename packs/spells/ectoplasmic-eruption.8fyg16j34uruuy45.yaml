  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A cascading avalanche of pale, swirling ectoplasmic matter erupts from a
    point you select. All creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 6d6
    points of bludgeoning damage and are entangled for a number of rounds equal
    to your caster level. This spell passes between planes, so it affects
    ethereal and incorporeal creatures normally.  In addition, each ethereal or
    incorporeal creature in the area must succeed at a Will save or be pushed
    partially onto the Material Plane for a number of rounds equal to your
    caster level. It must attempt this Will save regardless of whether it
    succeeded at the Reflex save. An incorporeal creature pushed partially onto
    the Material Plane can't enter or pass through solid objects, takes half
    damage from nonmagical attack forms, and takes full damage from magic
    weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. Corporeal
    spells and effects that don't cause damage affect the creature normally
    instead of having a 50% chance of affecting it. The creature still gains the
    other benefits of being incorporeal, and retains its attack bonuses and
    Armor Class.</p>
