      <p>These crushed and shredded leaves range in color from peppery red to
      black; users can either smoke or chew them. Tobacco users experience a
      certain level of calm and are more easily able to shrug off hunger pangs.
      Tobacco is addictive (<em>Fort</em> DC 10 to resist), and long-term users
      suffer <em>Constitution damage</em>.</p>
