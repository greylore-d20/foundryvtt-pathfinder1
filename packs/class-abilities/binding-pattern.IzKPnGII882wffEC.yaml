    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create
      a binding pattern of psychic energy that causes a living creature to
      become paralyzed. The target must be within 30 feet of you, and it can
      attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it fails the save, it
      is paralyzed for 1 round for every 2 occultist levels you possess.</p>

      <p>At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt another Will save to
      end the paralyzed effect and instead be staggered for the remaining
      duration. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>
