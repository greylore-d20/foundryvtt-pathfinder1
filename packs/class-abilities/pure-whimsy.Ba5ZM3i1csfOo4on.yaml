  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, you can release a stream of errant chaos from the First
      World as a standard action. When you do so, identify a target within 90
      feet and generate a random effect as from a rod of wonder (or, at the GMâ€™s
      discretion, another random or unusual effect of similar power). The DC of
      any required saving throw is 10 + half your oracle level + your Charisma
      modifier, and no effect from this ability persists for more than 1
      day.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day at 7th level and one additional
      time per day for every 4 levels beyond 7th. You must be at least 7th level
      to select this revelation.</p>
