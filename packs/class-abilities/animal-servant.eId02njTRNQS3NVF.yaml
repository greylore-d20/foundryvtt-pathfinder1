    value: "<p>The witch can use this hex to turn a humanoid enemy into an animal and rob it of its free will.</p><p>The transformation works as @Compendium[pf1.spells.774kmgcb7ygviht0]{Beast Shape II}\_and is negated by a successful Will save. The transformed creature retains its Intelligence score and known languages, if any, but the witch controls its mind.</p><p>This effect functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.66s5qm8kwycgobce]{Dominate Monster}, except the creature does not receive further saving throws to resist the hex.</p><p>The effect can be removed only with wish or similar magic, although slaying the witch also ends the effect.</p><p>Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>"
