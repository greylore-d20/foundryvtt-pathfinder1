  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, you can banish mental distress. You become immune to
      fear spells and effects and to the confused condition.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you can choose a willing creature that is either
      within 30 feet or in telepathic contact with you. For 1 round per psychic
      level you possess, you suppress any fear effect or confused, cowering,
      frightened, panicked, or shaken condition affecting that creature.</p>

      <p>You can suppress only one effect at a time with this ability, and
      choosing a new target ends the suppression for the character you
      previously chose.</p>
