  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack of
      her chosen energy type once per rage. She does not make a saving throw
      against the effect but takes no damage from it, instead gaining 1
      temporary hit point per 3 points of damage the attack would have
      inflicted. These temporary hit points last until the end of the
      barbarianâ€™s rage.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the greater energy resistance rage power to
      select this rage power.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
