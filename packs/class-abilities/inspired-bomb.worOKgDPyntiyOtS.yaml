  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An alchemist with this discovery and a pool of inspiration (by way of a
      class feature, a feat, or the inspiring cognatogen discovery) can expend
      two uses of inspiration to increase the bombâ€™s damage by 1d6. The type of
      damage the bomb deals does not change. Unlike other a discoveries that
      affect bombs, this one can be applied to a bomb with another bomb
      discovery, though it cannot be applied to the same bomb more than
      once.</p>
