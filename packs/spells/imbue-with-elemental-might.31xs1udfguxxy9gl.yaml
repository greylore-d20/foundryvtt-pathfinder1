  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>imbue with spell ability</i>, except you
    transfer the use of your elemental assault ability to the target. The target
    must have an Intelligence score of at least 5 to use the ability. The imbued
    elemental assault functions exactly like yours, except the ability's
    duration is based on the target's level or Hit Dice. Once you cast this
    spell, you cannot use your elemental assault ability until the duration of
    the spell is over.</p>
