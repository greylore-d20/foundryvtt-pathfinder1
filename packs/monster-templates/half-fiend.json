A half-fiend uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<p><b>CR:</b> HD 4 or less, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.<p><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil.<p><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to outsider (native). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by +1.<p><b>Defenses/Qualities:</b> Gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to poison; acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10; DR 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more); and SR equal to creature's CR + 11 (maximum 35).<p><b>Speed:</b> Unless the base creature flies better, the half-fiend flies at twice the base creature's land speed (good).<p><b>Melee:</b> A half-fiend gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. Damage depends on its size (see pages 301–302).<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A half-fiend gains the following.<p><em>Smite Good (Su):</em> Once per day as a swift action the half-fiend can smite good as the smite evil ability of a paladin of the same level as the half-fiend's Hit Dice, except affecting a good target. The smite persists until the target is dead of the half-fiend rests.<p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> A half-fiend with an Int or Wis score of 8 or higher has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable 1/day. CL equals the creature's HD (or the CL of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).</p>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>HD</b></td>\n<td><b>Abilities</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1–2</td>\n<td><em>Darkness </em>3/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3–4</td>\n<td><em>Desecrate</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5–6</td>\n<td><em>Unholy blight</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7–8</td>\n<td><em>Poison </em>3/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9–10</td>\n<td><em>Contagion</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11–12</td>\n<td><em>Blasphemy</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13–14</td>\n<td><em>Unholy aura </em>3/day, <em>unhallow</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15–16</td>\n<td><em>Horrid wilting</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17–18</td>\n<td><em>Summon monster IX </em>(fiends only)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19–20</td>\n<td><em>Destruction</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p><br><b>Abilities:</b> A half-fiend gains a +4 bonus on three ability scores of its choice and a +2 bonus on the other three.
