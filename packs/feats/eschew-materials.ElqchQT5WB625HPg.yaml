    value: >-
      <i>You can cast many spells without needing to utilize minor material
      components.</i><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You can cast any spell with a
      material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component.
      The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
      If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you
      must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal.</p>
