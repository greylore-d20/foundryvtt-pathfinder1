This grants the creature a new saving throw to immediately end a single <em>mind-affecting</em> effect currently affecting the creature (effects that allow no saving throw cannot be removed in this way). An unwilling creature can be dosed with the pollen as a <em>touch attack</em> that provokes an <em>attack of opportunity</em>. A creature can be affected by a dose of nepenthe only once in a single 24-hour period. This is a <em>poison</em> effect.</p>\r\n"
