    value: >-
      <p>When the investigator deals damage with a studied strike, she can
      perform a sunder combat maneuver as a free action against the creature the
      studied strike damaged. If the object targeted is a holy symbol or divine
      scroll, this sunder does not provoke attacks of opportunity and deals
      maximum damage on a successful check.</p>

      <p>An investigator must be at least 13th level to select this talent.</p>
