  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This short, wide net is covered in barbed loops and slipknots. It works
      like a typical net, except it has the trip weapon special feature. If you
      entangle an opponent and hold the trailing rope, on your turn in place of
      a melee attack you may make a combat maneuver check to trip against that
      opponent; if you succeed, you may trip your opponent or deal 1 point of
      piercing damage to it. The concentration DC to cast while entangled in a
      snag net is 17 + the spell's level. The Escape Artist DC to escape a snag
      net is 22.</p>
