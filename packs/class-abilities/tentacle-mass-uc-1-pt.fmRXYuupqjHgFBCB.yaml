      <p>The eidolon grows a thick mass of tentacles that can be used as a
      primary natural weapon. The tentacles deal 1d8 points of damage if the
      eidolon is Medium. Eidolons with the grab evolution that is linked to a
      tentacle mass can use that ability to grapple foes of up to the eidolonâ€™s
      size, and they can also use this evolution in place of the serpentine base
      form to qualify for the constrict evolution.</p>
