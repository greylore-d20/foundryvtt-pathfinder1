    value: >-
      <p>The shaman gains DR 3/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every 4 shaman
      levels she possesses beyond 8th. In addition, as a standard action she can
      cause jagged pieces of bone to explode from her body in a 10-footradius
      burst. This deals 1d6 points of piercing damage for every 2 shaman levels
      she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait
      1d4 rounds between each use.</p>
