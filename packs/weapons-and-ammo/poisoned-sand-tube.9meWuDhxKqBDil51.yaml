      <p>Resembling a slim scroll case made of bamboo or metal, this tube is
      filled with fine sand that is soaked or coated with inhaled or contact
      poison. When loaded with 3 doses of these types of poison, you can blow
      into the tube to disperse the poisoned sand into your enemies' faces in a
      15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone is affected as if afflicted with 1
      dose of the poison. Even when loaded with unpoisoned sand, the tube lets
      loose a powerful irritant, and an opponent struck must succeed at a DC 12
      Fortitude saving throw or be dazzled for 1 round. Once expended, the tube
      must be repacked before it can be used again. Repacking a tube requires a
      full-round action, or a standard action if you have the Rapid Reload
      feat.</p>
