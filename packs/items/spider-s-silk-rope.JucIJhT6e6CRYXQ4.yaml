    value: >-
      <p>This 50-foot length of rope is woven of strands of silk from monstrous
      spiders. Rare to virtually nonexistent on the surface world, it is
      commonly used by the dark elves, though shorter spider’s silk rope scraps
      (generally no more than 10 feet long) occasionally appear among goblins.
      Spider’s silk rope has 6 hit points and can be broken with a DC 25
      Strength check.</p>
