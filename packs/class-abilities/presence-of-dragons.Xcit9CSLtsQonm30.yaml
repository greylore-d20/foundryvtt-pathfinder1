      <p><strong>Source</strong> Legacy of Dragons pg. 9</p><p>Those who would
      oppose you must overcome their fear of dragons or be struck with terror at
      your draconic majesty. As a swift action, you can manifest an aura of
      draconic might around yourself. Enemies within 30 feet who can see you
      when you activate this ability must attempt a Will save. Success means
      that the creature is immune to this ability for the following 24 hours. On
      a failed save, the opponent is shaken for 2d6 rounds. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p>You can use this ability once per day at
      1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5
      levels beyond 5th.</p>
