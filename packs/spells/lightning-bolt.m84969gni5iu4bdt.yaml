  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points
    of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature
    within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.</p><p>The <i>lightning
    bolt</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can
    melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or
    bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks
    through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range
    permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect
    does.</p>
