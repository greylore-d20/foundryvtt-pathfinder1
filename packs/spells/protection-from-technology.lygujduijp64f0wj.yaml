      <p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by technological objects and
      creatures of the robot subtype, and protects against mental control from
      technological sources. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at
      a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has two major
      effects.</p><p>First, the target gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a
      +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. Both of these bonuses apply against
      attacks made or effects caused by technological objects and creatures with
      the robot subtype.</p><p>Second, the target immediately receives another
      saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any technological
      effects that exercise mental control over the creature, including the
      effects of pharmaceuticals such as torpinal. The target gains a +2 morale
      bonus on this saving throw, using the same DC as the original effect. If
      the target succeeds at this save, such effects are suppressed for the
      duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell
      expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to
      any new attempts to exercise mental control over her using technological
      means.</p>
