      <p>This spell functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{dispel magic}, except that it can
      end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple
      creatures.</p>

      <p>You choose to use <em>greater dispel magic</em> in one of three ways: a
      targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell: <em>Targeted Dispel</em>:
      This functions as a targeted <em>dispel magic</em>, but it can dispel one
      spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest
      level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.</p>

      <p>Additionally, <em>greater dispel magic</em> has a chance to dispel any
      effect that <em>remove curse</em> can remove, even if <em>dispel
      magic</em> can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the
      curse's DC.</p>

      <p><em>Area Dispel</em>: When <em>greater dispel magic</em> is used in
      this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll
      one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if
      targeted by <em>dispel magic</em>. For each object within the area that is
      the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with
      creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p>

      <p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within
      the area of the <em>greater dispel magic</em> spell, apply the dispel
      check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that
      of the <em>greater dispel magic</em> spell, apply the dispel check to end
      the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p>

      <p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such
      as a monster summoned by <em>summon monster</em>) is in the area, apply
      the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature
      (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one
      spell targeting the creature or object.</p>

      <p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any
      spell that you have cast.</p>

      <p><em>Counterspell</em>: This functions as <em>dispel magic</em>, but you
      receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's
      spell.</p>
