    value: >-
      <p>You touch a creature and temporarily absorb its knowledge for yourself.
      If the target fails its saving throw, you can sort through its lore and
      memories. You can retrieve one answer to a specific question per minute,
      as through sifting through the creature's surface thoughts with <i>detect
      thoughts</i>. Alternatively, you can tap into the target's learned
      experiences and attempt one Knowledge check in a skill in which the target
      has at least 1 rank, using the target's total skill modifier. Each
      Knowledge check requires 1 minute and allows the target another Will save
      to resist the effect. If the target successfully resists, the spell does
      not end, but you are unable to attempt another Knowledge check for that
      skill using this spell. You can also use this spell against targets
      trapped in magic items or spells that hold their bodies or souls, such as
      an <i>iron flask</i> or the spell <i>trap the soul</i>, by touching the
      associated receptacle.</p>
