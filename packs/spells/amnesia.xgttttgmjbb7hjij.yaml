  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause the target to lose most of its memories; its skills, its past,
    and even its name become mysteries to it. While the target can build new
    memories, it has trouble accessing those gained before falling victim to the
    spell. The target can still speak and read any languages it knows and
    perform basic tasks, but it loses all class abilities, feats, and skill
    ranks gained before being affected by <i>amnesia</i>. It retains its base
    attack bonus, saving throws bonuses, Combat Maneuver Bonus, Combat Maneuver
    Defense, total experience points, Hit Dice, and hit points. If the target
    gains a character level while suffering from <i>amnesia</i>, it can use any
    abilities gained by that class level normally. If the class level it gained
    was from a class in which it already has levels, it gains the abilities of a
    1st-level character of that class, even though it is technically of a higher
    level in that class. If the <i>amnesia</i> is cured, the target regains the
    full abilities of the class, including those gained from any levels taken
    while suffering from this condition. <i>Amnesia</i> can be removed only by
    <i>heal</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>psychic</i>
    surgeryOA, or <i>wish</i>.</p>
