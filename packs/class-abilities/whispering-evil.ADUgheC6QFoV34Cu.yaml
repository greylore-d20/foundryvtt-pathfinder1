  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, as a standard action, you can whisper a hypnotizing
      litany of empty promises. Each enemy within a 30-foot emanation that can
      hear you must succeed on a Will saving throw or become fascinated for as
      long as you continue the litany. You can use this power a number of rounds
      per day equal to your cleric level, but these rounds do not need to be
      consecutive. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Scythe of Evil power of the Evil Domain.</p>
