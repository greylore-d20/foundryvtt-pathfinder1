She may not forgive even the slightest insult.<p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever a cavalier of the order of vengeance issues a challenge against a creature whose kind she has encountered in the past 24 hours, the cavalier gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of her challenge. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the cavalier possesses.<p><b>Skills:</b> A cavalier of the order of vengeance adds Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (nobility) to her list of class skills.
