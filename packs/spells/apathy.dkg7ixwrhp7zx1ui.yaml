  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause a creature to temporarily lose interest in a passion or
    pursuit, taking the heat off your trail to facilitate a getaway, the
    finalization of a scheme, or the elimination of incriminating evidence. When
    casting the spell, you designate a subject or activity about which the
    target becomes indifferent. While under the effects of <i>apathy</i>, the
    target takes a -5 penalty on all skill checks and ability checks to
    investigate, pursue, or otherwise advance its goals in relation to the
    designated subject. In most cases, however, the target does not attempt such
    checks if they can be avoided, as it simply has no interest in putting
    effort into the endeavor.  If the chosen activity is something that would be
    harmful for the target to refrain from doing (such as eating, sleeping, or
    holding its breath underwater), the target receives a +5 bonus on the saving
    throw or other check required by its inaction, and receives a new saving
    throw to negate the effects of this spell with the same +5 bonus immediately
    after. The bonus on these saving throws and checks increases by 1 for each
    subsequent check required by the same condition. If you directly interact
    with the target of this spell (such as engaging it in combat or targeting it
    with another spell or effect), the spell immediately ends.</p>
