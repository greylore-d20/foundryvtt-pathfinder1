      <p>You create a gap in the target's memory, preventing the target from
      remembering anything that happens from the moment you cast this spell
      until the moment its complete duration ends. <i>Fleeting memory</i>
      doesn't wipe out its target's memories until the end of its duration, so
      the target can remember the preceding rounds until the spell's duration
      ends. If the spell ends prematurely, either because you dismiss it or
      because it is dispelled, it disperses without affecting its target's
      memory.  Whether or not the target's save is successful, the target
      forgets that you cast a spell.</p>
