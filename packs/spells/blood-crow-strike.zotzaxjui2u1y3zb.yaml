  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Your unarmed strikes release blasts of energy in the form of bolts of
    fire or glowing red crows, which fly instantaneously to strike your target.
    You can make unarmed strike or flurry of blows attacks against the target as
    if it were in your threatened area; each successful attack deals damage as
    if you had hit it with your unarmed strike, except half the damage is fire
    and half is negative energy (this negative energy does not heal undead). For
    example, if you are a 14th-level monk, you can use a flurry of blows to
    attack five times, creating one energy crow for each successful attack
    against the target, and dealing 2d6 points of damage (plus appropriate
    unarmed strike modifiers) with each crow.</p>
