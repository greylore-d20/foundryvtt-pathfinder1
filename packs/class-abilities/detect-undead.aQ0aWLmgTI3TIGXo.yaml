  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At will, a vampire hunter can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.aa0w7tk852iqn3ni]{Detect Undead}, as the spell. A
      vampire hunter can, as a <em>move action</em>, concentrate on a single
      item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is <em>undead</em>,
      learning the strength of its aura as if he had studied it for 3 rounds.
      While focusing on one individual or object, the vampire hunter does not
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.aa0w7tk852iqn3ni]{Detect Undead} in any other
      object or individual within range.</p>
