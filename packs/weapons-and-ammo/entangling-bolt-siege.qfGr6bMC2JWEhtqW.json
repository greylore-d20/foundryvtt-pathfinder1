An attack with entangling ammunition is a ranged touch attack, but it's only effective within one range increment. If it hits, the target is entangled, but the attack deals no damage.</p>\n<p>An entangled creature can escape with a successful <b>DC 20 Escape Artist check</b> (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a successful <b>DC 25 Strength check</b> (also a full-round action).</p>\n<p>Entangling ammunition is useful only against creatures within one size category of the firing ballista.</p>"
