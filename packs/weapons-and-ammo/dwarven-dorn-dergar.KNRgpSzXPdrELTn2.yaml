    value: >-
      <p>This 10-foot-long chain is weighted at the end by a ball of solid iron
      the size of a large fist. By adjusting the slack of the chain, the weapon
      can be used either with or without reach. Changing between using it as a
      normal weapon and a reach weapon is a move action.</p>
