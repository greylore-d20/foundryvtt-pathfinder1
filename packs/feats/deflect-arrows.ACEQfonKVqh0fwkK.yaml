    value: >-
      <p><em>You can knock arrows and other projectiles off course, preventing
      them from hitting you.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br>Dex
      13, @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed
      Strike}.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong><br>You must have at least one
      hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you
      would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect
      it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and
      not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn't count as an
      action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista
      bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects
      can't be deflected.</p><p><strong>Combat Trick</strong><br>You can spend 5
      stamina points to deflect an arrow while you're flat-footed. You must
      still be aware of the attack.</p>
