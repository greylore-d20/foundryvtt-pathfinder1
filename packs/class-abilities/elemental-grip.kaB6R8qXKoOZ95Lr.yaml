      <p>You use your element to halt a creature associated with your element,
      as @Compendium[pf1.spells.d8hypv6zdyan3rzr]{Hold Monster} except it
      requires concentration to maintain, and it works only on creatures with a
      subtype matching one of your elements (for example, a pyrokineticist could
      use it on creatures of the fire subtype).</p>

      <p>At any time, you can accept 1 point of burn to remove the need to
      concentrate.</p>
