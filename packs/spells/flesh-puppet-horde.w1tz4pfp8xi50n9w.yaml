  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>flesh puppet</i>, but can animate multiple
      zombies. As noted in <i>animate dead</i>, you can't control more than 4 HD
      per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create
      more than 2 HD per caster level. A separate string attaches to each zombie
      in your horde. Severing a zombie's string reverts that zombie to a corpse,
      but doesn't end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a <i>flesh
      puppet</i> requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one
      zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to
      follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak
      per round.  Unlike with <i>flesh puppet</i>, you can command a zombie to
      attack. If you do, all your zombies immediately gain the staggered quality
      and no longer appear to be alive.  This spell ends automatically if you
      cast <i>flesh puppet</i> or <i>flesh puppet</i> horde on a new corpse.</p>
