  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a coil of flowing fresh water, functioning a whip
      appropriate for your size, except you make a melee touch attack instead of
      a regular attack. Anything you strike with the whip takes damage and is
      doused with 1 pint of water.</p><p>A creature with the fire subtype takes
      an additional 1d6 points of damage. If the target is on fire, it gains a
      +2 bonus on its next saving throw to extinguish the flames.</p><p>After
      you have successfully used the whip to hit a creature a number of times
      equal to your caster level, the water is expended and the spell is
      discharged. The water created by this spell is otherwise identical to that
      produced by <i>create water</i>.</p>
