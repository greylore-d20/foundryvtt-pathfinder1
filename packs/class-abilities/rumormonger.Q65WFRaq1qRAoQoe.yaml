      <p>A rogue with this talent can attempt to spread a rumor though a small
      town or larger settlement by making a Bluff check. She can do so a number
      of times per week equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The DC is
      based on the size of the settlement, and it takes a week for the rumor to
      propagate through the settlement. If the check succeeds, the rumor is
      practically accepted as fact within the community; succeeding by 5 or more
      over the DC decreases the time it takes the rumor to propagate by 1d4
      days. A failed check means the rumor failed to gain traction, while
      failing by 5 or more causes the opposite of the rumor or some other
      competing theory involving the rumorâ€™s subject to take hold.<br><br></p>
