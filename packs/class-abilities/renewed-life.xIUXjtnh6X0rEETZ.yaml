  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian ignores the effect of one temporary
      negative level per four barbarian levels she has (maximum 5). Once per
      day, when a barbarian with temporary negative levels ends her rage, she
      can attempt saving throws to remove a number of negative levels equal to
      the number of levels she could ignore while raging.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the renewed vitality rage power and be at least
      6th level before selecting this rage power.</p>
