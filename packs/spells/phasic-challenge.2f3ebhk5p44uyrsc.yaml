  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You select one enemy and one willing ally as targets. The enemy gains a
    new Will saving throw at the beginning of each turn, and on a successful
    saving throw the spell ends. Both targets remain visible and audible, and
    can see and hear other creatures, but cannot physically interact with any
    creature save one another. Spells or weapon attacks from the affected
    creatures impact only each other, though spells might affect terrain or
    other factors not related to other creatures. If one of the creatures
    becomes unconscious or dies, or if the effect is dispelled, the effect ends
    for both of them.</p>
