The British military produced the Lawrence  1917, which found its way into the hands of  Russia's soldiers. The device consists  of a cumbersome backpack  of two tanks and a swivelmounted,  handheld projection  unit, or \"lance.\" When the device  is aimed and a small hand lever  depressed, a small gas burner ignites the oil, which is  propelled forth in a blazing stream of intense flame. A  f lamethrower with full tanks is capable of unleashing up  to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect.</p><p></p><p>  When using a flamethrower, the wielder projects a  60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a separate attack roll  against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes  a -2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified  by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as  Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or  smoke, or the <em>blur</em>, <em>invisibility</em>, or <em>mirror image</em> spells, do not  foil this line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical  hit, the wielder confirms the critical for that roll alone.</p><p></p><p>  All affected creatures take 4d6 points of damage,  and any creature hit by the flaming stream must also  succeed at succeed at a DC 20 Ref lex save or catch fire,  taking an additional 2d6 points of damage each round  until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature  can attempt a new save as a full-round action, and  dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +2 bonus  on this save.</p><p></p><p>  The device's tanks and backpacks are awkward, and the  wielder takes a -4 armor check penalty when wearing the  cumbersome device. In addition, the tanks have hardness  10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured in the  presence of any adjacent flame (including the device's own  gas igniter), a mighty conflagration erupts, the wielder  takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and all creatures within a  20-foot radius take 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20  for half ). Any creatures who take damage must succeed at a  DC 20 Reflex save or catch on fire.</p>",
