  shortDescription: >-
    <p><i>Stalwart resolve</i> was originally created to temporarily
    aid those suffering from certain afflictions. The recipient of <i>stalwart
    resolve</i> ignores the effects of ability damage and penalties to a single
    ability score of your choice, except that damage equal to or greater than
    the ability score still causes unconsciousness or death. This applies
    whether or not the ability damage or penalty happened before or during the
    spell's duration, and whether or not multiple sources are involved. This
    spell has no effect on ability drain.</p>
