  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, you can spend 2 points from your phrenic pool as a
      standard action once per day to take on the form of one of your previous
      incarnations. This ability functions as the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.d40ia71c2eljm91k]{Polymorph} spell, but its range
      is personal and its duration becomes 10 minutes per caster level.</p>
