      <p>A <em>limited wish</em> lets you create nearly any type of effect. For
      example, a <em>limited wish</em> can do any of the following
      things.</p><ul><li><p>Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or
      lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition
      schools.</p></li><li><p>Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th
      level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your
      opposition schools.</p></li><li><p>Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of
      5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition
      schools.</p></li><li><p>Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th
      level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition
      schools.</p></li><li><p>Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as
      <em>geas/quest</em> or <em>insanity</em>.</p></li><li><p>Produce any other
      effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a
      single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -7
      penalty on its next saving throw.</p></li></ul><p>A duplicated spell
      allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is
      for a 7th-level spell. When a <em>limited wish</em> spell duplicates a
      spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must
      provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for
      this spell).</p>
