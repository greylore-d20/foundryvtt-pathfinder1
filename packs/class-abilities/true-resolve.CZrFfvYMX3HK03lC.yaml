    value: >-
      <p>At 17th level, a samurai can spend uses of his resolve to avoid death.
      If he has at least two uses of his resolve remaining, he can spend all of
      the daily uses of his resolve that he has available to him to avoid death.
      Regardless of the source of the attack that would have killed him, he is
      left alive, at –1 hit points (or lower if he was already below –1),
      unconscious, and stable.</p>
