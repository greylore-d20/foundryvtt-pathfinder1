    value: >-
      <p>A word of arcane-empowered inspiration can snatch victory from seeming
      defeat. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill
      check. The target gains a +1 competence bonus per five caster levels
      (maximum +3 bonus) on the attack roll or skill check retroactively. If the
      bonus is enough to make the failure a success, the roll succeeds.</p>
