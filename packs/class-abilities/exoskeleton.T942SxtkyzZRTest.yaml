  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you can grow an exoskeleton that grants you a +1
      enhancement bonus to your natural armor and 1d4 temporary hit points + 1
      for every 2 cleric levels you have. The natural armor bonus increases by 1
      for every 5 cleric levels you have. The exoskeleton retracts after 1
      round, ending its benefits. You can use this ability a number of times per
      day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
