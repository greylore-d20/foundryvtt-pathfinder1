  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Most races find this pale and frothy beer too salty to swallow, but
      <em>halflings</em> simply consider it an acquired taste. Drinking three or
      more cups of Luglurch in a 1-minute span gives a <em>halfling</em> a -2
      penalty on <em>Perception</em> checks and a +1 bonus on <em>Reflex</em>
      saves and <em>Acrobatics</em> checks for 10
      minutes.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Non-<em>halflings</em> do not
      receive any bonuses from this drink.</p>
