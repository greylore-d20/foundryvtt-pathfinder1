If the rogue also has or later takes the hide in plain sight advanced talent (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat&nbsp;71), her favored terrain must match a terrain she has selected for that advanced talent. If the rogue has ranger levels, her effective ranger level is equal to her ranger level + 5 for purposes of improving the bonuses from this favored terrain and gaining new favored terrains. A rogue must be at least 5th level to select this talent.</p>"
