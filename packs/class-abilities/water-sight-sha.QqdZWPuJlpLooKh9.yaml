      <p><strong>Source</strong> Advanced Class Guide pg. 45</p><p>The shaman
      sees through fog and mist without penalty as long as there is enough light
      to otherwise allow her to see normally. At 7th level, she can use
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.g66w32kdup1f43bp]{scrying}, using any calm
      pool of water thatâ€™s at least 1 foot in diameter as the sole focus. At
      15th level, this functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.glt6uk3n6g6l2p6l]{greater scrying}. She can
      use these abilities for a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman
      level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
