  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By donning a silver circlet anointed with blood, you gain the ability
      to sense traitorous intent toward a single person to whom you defer,
      designated when you cast the spell. The spell alerts you when a creature
      with traitorous intent is within 200 feet, although it doesn't identify
      the source. By concentrating, you can learn the strength of the greatest
      threat, based on the following categories. <i>Ill Will</i>: Someone
      dislikes your liege, but isn't planning to act against her.
      <i>Plotting</i>: Someone is actively conspiring against your liege.
      <i>Imminent</i>: Someone is in the process of carrying out a plot against
      your liege.  Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting or
      thought-detecting effects cannot have their intent detected by <i>perceive
      betrayal</i>.</p>
