  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting
      magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day,
      he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level
      (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick
      implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous
      one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the
      previous trick).<p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard
      action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in
      himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a
      time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a
      triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick’s description), even
      if it isn’t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet +
      10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist
      monitors for the trick’s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic
      connection, so he doesn’t need line of sight to trigger it—but anything
      that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An
      implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his
      spells.<p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can’t be
      triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration
      of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or
      appears in the trick’s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful
      trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the
      mesmerist’s level + the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier.<p>The mesmerist
      knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and
      every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each
      daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the
      mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick’s
      description, a mesmerist can’t choose a particular trick more than
      once.</p>
