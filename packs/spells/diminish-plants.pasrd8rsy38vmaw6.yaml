  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell has two versions.</p><p><i>Prune Growth</i>: This version of
    the spell causes normal vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per
    level) to shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled and less
    bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and
    trimmed. This version of <i>diminish plants</i> automatically dispels any
    spells or effects that enhance plants, such as <i>entangle</i>, <i>plant
    growth</i>, and <i>Wall of Thorns</i>.</p><p>At your option, the area can be
    a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius
    quarter-circle. You may also designate portions of the area that are not
    affected.</p><p><i>Stunt Growth</i>: This version of the spell targets all
    normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential
    productivity over the course of the following year to half
    normal.</p><p>This spell has no effect on plant creatures.</p>
