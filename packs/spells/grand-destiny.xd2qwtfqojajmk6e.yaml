  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You inspire the target with the power to seize a <i>grand destiny</i>.
    The target gains a +4 competence bonus that it can choose to apply before
    rolling any attack roll, caster level check, saving throw, or skill check.
    The spell ends once the bonus has been applied to two rolls. At 12th level
    and 15th level, the bonus can be applied an additional time before the spell
    is discharged. A subject can be under the effect of only one <i>grand
    destiny</i> spell at a time.</p>
