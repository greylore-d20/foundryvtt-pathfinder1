    <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> In order to prepare this spell, the caster must
    spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches <b>Grundinnar</b>.
    Further details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of
    Golarion.</em></p><p>You can attempt to influence unfriendly or hostile
    creatures, altering their attitudes toward you. After casting, make a
    Diplomacy check against the creatures as a free action; you gain a +2 sacred
    bonus on this check against creatures that failed their saves against the
    spell. Even if you favorably manipulate the attitude of the affected
    targets, they quickly revert to their previous attitude if threatened or
    treated poorly.</p>
