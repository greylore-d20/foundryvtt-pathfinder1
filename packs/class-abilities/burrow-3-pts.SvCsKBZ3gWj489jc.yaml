  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through
      the earth. The eidolon gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2 its base speed.
      It can use this speed to move through dirt, clay, sand, and earth. It does
      not leave a hole behind, nor is its passage marked on the surface.</p>

      <p>The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this
      evolution.</p>
