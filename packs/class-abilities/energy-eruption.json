      "value": "<p>While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack and unleash it upon her enemies once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it. At any point during the remainder of her rage she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or 30-foot cone. The breath weapon inflicts damage equal to the damage from the attack absorbed by the barbarian, but creatures within the area may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier) for half damage even if the original effect did not allow a save.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must have the energy absorption rage power to select this rage power.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must be at least 16th level to select this rage power.</p>"
