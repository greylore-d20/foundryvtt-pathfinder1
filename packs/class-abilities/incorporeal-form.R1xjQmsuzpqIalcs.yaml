  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, you can become <em>incorporeal</em> for 1 round per
      sorcerer level. While in this form, you gain the incorporeal subtype. You
      only take half damage from corporeal sources as long as they are magic
      (you take no damage from non-magic weapons and objects). Likewise, your
      spells deal only half damage to corporeal creatures. Spells and other
      effects that do not deal damage function normally. You can use this
      ability once per day.</p>
