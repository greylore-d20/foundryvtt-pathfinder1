When exposed to air, the moldable substance quickly creates a thin, paper-like surface, which is ideal for creating false earthen walls. Creating a 5-foot-by-5-foot section of paper wall requires a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>. Though this false wall is easy to punch through, it requires a successful DC 13 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a> check to identify the wall as a fake. If the creator of the paper wall spends an additional <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a> disguising the wall with dirt and pebbles, the DC increases by 2.</p>\r\n<p><b>Create</b>: <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a> (alchemy) DC 15</p>\r\n"
