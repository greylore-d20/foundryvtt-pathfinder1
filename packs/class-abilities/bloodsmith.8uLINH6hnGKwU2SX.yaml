      manufactured weapon you wield, shield you wield, or piece of armor you
      wear to gain the benefit of @Compendium[pf1.spells.zq7xi7l5vgpqu7rt]{Magic
      Weapon, Greater} (weapon) or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.73han2zqxg59u18g]{Magic Vestment}. The caster level
      of this effect is equal to your bloodrager level, and its effects end when
      your bloodrage ends or when you no longer wear or wield the weapon,
