Each round on your turn, you must take a move action to guide the elemental or it collapses back into its component element.</p>\n<p>By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of your own sentience into the elemental, removing the mindless quality and allowing it to persist for 1 round per kineticist level without requiring any further actions.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, you can choose to form a Large elemental as if by @Compendium[pf1.spells.hd7ukybisvv7j5r6]{Summon Monster V}.</p>\n<p>at 14th level, you can choose to form a Huge elemental as if by @Compendium[pf1.spells.mf6k8tg8xu0wedoz]{Summon Monster VI}.</p>\n<p>at 16th level, you can choose to form a greater elemental as if by @Compendium[pf1.spells.et3440o24hcgrfwl]{Summon Monster VII}.</p>\n<p>at 18th level, you can choose to form an elder elemental as if by @Compendium[pf1.spells.j91n23p4tfjixp3s]{Summon Monster VIII}.</p>"
