      <p>A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the
      material <em>components</em> and focuses needed for spellcasting, except
      for <em>components</em> that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and
      focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch. Most spell component pouches are
      waterproof and can be strung onto a belt or bandolier.</p>
