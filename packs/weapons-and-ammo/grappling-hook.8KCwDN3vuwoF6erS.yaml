      <b>Critical</b> x2; <b>Range</b> 10 ft.; <b>Type</b>
      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A grappling hook is usually thought of as a
      climbing instrument, but is also used to grapple enemy ships and draw them
      close before a boarding action.</p><p>Grappling hooks bite deeply into the
      wood of the railing. It takes 1 minute to pry a grappling hook free. The
      rope attached to a grappling hook can be cut, but pirates often target the
      rigging and masts to make it difficult to remove the hooks. Tying off the
      rope of a grappling hook is a move action.</p><p>A grappling hook can also
      be used as a ranged weapon. If you are proficient in the grappling hook,
      it is a grappling weapon. On a successful critical hit with a weapon of
      this type, you can grapple the target of the attack. You can attempt a
      combat maneuver check to grapple your opponent as a free action. This
      grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the
      creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening
      you. While you grapple the target with a grappling weapon, you can only
      move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered
      grappled, though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to
      continue the grapple. If you move far enough away to be out of the
      weapon's reach, the grapple ends.</p><p>A grappling hook's weight includes
      the weight of 50 feet of hemp rope. It can be reduced by using shorter or
      lighter rope.</p>
