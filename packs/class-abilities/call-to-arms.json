      "value": "<p>At 20th level, you can summon a ghostly army from a fallen civilization once per day. This functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.0lrux8tmaml5fkw6]{Spiritual Ally}&nbsp;with a caster level equal to your level, except that it summons a number of allies equal to your Constitution modifier, and the allies use your Strength modifier for attack rolls. You can direct all of these allies with a single swift action. Each ally can attack a different target or the same target, as you direct. The allies remain until the spell’s duration ends or your bloodrage ends, whichever comes first.</p>"
