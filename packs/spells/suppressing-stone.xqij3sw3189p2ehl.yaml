  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You infuse arcane power into the focus <i>ioun stone</i>, which must be
      currently floating around your head. If the <i>ioun stone</i> ever ceases
      floating around you, the spell ends immediately, and the spell fails if
      the <i>ioun stone</i> in question is cracked, burned, flawed, or otherwise
      of lesser value (such as a dull gray <i>ioun stone</i>). While the spell
      is active, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against
      mind-affecting effects for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5 at caster
      level 20). Whenever you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell
      or effect, you can burn out the focus, transforming it irrevocably into a
      dull gray <i>ioun stone</i> and ending this spell, but suppressing the
      mind-affecting effect for 1 round per 2,500 gp of value of the focus
      (minimum 1 round). Rounds during which the effect is suppressed still
      count against its duration, and the effect can still be dispelled or
      disrupted during this time.</p>
