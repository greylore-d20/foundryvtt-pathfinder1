      "value": "<p>At 15th level, once per day as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>, you can attune yourself to the Astral’s timeless nature to halt the effects of one condition or affliction (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a>, or a curse), including permanent and instantaneous conditions, until the end of your next turn. You can use this ability even when a condition or affliction would normally prevent you from doing so, regardless of whether you’re targeting that prevention effect’s source. At the end of your next turn the condition or affliction resumes its normal effect and the round delayed by this ability does not count toward the condition or affliction’s duration. This ability has no effect on hit point damage,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage\">ability damage</a>, or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;condition. Alternatively, you can use this ability to extend the duration of any one effect affecting you until the end of your next turn; this does not extend the duration for any other creatures under the effect. At 19th level, you can use this ability twice per day.</p>"
