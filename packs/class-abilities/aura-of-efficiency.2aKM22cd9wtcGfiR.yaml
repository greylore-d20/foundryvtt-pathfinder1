  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot-radius aura that grants your
      allies a +4 bonus on all saving throws against effects that inflict the
      fatigued or exhausted condition. Any equipment wielded by your allies
      within this area gets a bonus to hardness equal to 1/2 your cleric level,
      and your alliesâ€™ attacks against targets within this area ignore an equal
      amount of hardness. You can use this aura for a number of rounds per day
      equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Dancing Weapon power of the Artifice
      Domain.</p>
