    value: >-
      <p>The shaman’s command of lore can cause weaker minds to become mired in
      confusion. The shaman chooses a single intelligent target within 30 feet.
      That creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or become confused for a
      number of rounds equal to the shaman’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>

      <p>Once affected by this hex, the creature cannot be the target of this
      hex again for 24 hours.</p>
