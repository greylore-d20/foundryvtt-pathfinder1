    value: >-
      <p>This spiraling animal horn can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the
      command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6
      points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them
      to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage
      by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take
      7d6 points of sonic damage, with no save unless they're held, worn, or
      carried by creatures (Fortitude DC 16 negates).</p><p>If a <em>horn of
      blasting</em> is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a
      20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6
      points of sonic damage to the person sounding
      it.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong>
