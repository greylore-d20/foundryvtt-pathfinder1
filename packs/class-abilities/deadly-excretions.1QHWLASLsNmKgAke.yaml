    value: >-
      <p>When using his <em>toxic skin</em> ability, the alchemist can choose to
      excrete a Constitution poison instead of a Dexterity poison. This poison
      works the same as the normal <em>grippli toxic skin</em> poison except
      that a failed save deals 1 point of Constitution damage.</p><p>The
      alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the <em>toxic skin
      racial trait</em> before selecting this discovery.</p>
