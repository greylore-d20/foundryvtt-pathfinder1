  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist infuses herself with the toughness of the plant life that
      she studies. The arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to
      gain a +2 natural armor bonus and DR/slashing equal to her Charisma
      modifier (minimum 1) for 1 minute per arcanist level. While this ability
      is in effect, she counts as both her original creature type and a plant
      creature for the purpose of abilities and spells.</p>
