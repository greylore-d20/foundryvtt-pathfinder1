  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Followers of Arazni have made use of this litany since her days as a
    crusader and herald. Each time the target creature takes piercing or
    slashing damage, it takes 1 point of bleed damage; this bleed damage stacks
    with itself. While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of
    another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.</p>
