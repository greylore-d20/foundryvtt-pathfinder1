She still loses her <em>Dexterity</em> bonus to <em>armor class</em> if immobilized. A character with this ability can still lose her <em>Dexterity</em> bonus to <em>armor class</em> if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>\n<p>If a character already has <em>uncanny dodge</em> from a different class, she automatically gains <em>improved uncanny dodge</em> (see below) instead.</p>"
