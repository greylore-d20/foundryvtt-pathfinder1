    value: >-
      <p>Originally designed by an Aldori magus who had long admired
      swashbucklers for their ability to deflect blows, Deivon's parry has
      swiftly gained popularity among bards and magi alike. Your reflexes snap
      into action, allowing you to deflect a blow. This spell can be cast only
      when an opponent makes a melee attack against you, and only before the
      attack roll has been made. Make a parry attempt with a light or one-handed
      weapon you're wielding, as if using the swashbuckler's
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.Vvm6rtmeg1DwIEAC]{opportune
      parry and riposte} deed (except that this does not require panache). You
      cannot riposte as part of this spell's effect.</p>
