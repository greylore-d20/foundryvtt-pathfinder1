      to avoid traps and a +1 <em>dodge bonus</em> to AC against attacks made by

      levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p><p>This ability
      counts as @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.BoEkMviJrW0PKmhj]{trap
      sense} for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be
      replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces <em>trap sense</em>.
      The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from <em>trap
      sense</em> (from another class).</p>
