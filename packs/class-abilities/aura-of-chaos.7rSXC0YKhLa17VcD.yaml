    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can surround yourself with a field wild energies.
      Thee energies manifest as a 30-foot aura of chaos for a number of rounds
      per day equal to your cleric level. All enemies within this aura must
      declare one type of action at the start of their turn (attack, cast a
      spell, move, use an item, or activate a special ability) and make a Will
      save. Creatures that fail the Will save must take an action other than
      their declared action. If they succeed, they must take the declared
      action. Creatures cannot select actions that they cannot perform.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Chaos Blade power of the Chaos Domain.</p>
