    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can flicker in and out of time, gaining
      concealment (as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.18kryvj2dfuymk9d]{Blur} spell).
      You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level that you possess
      per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be
      spent in 1-minute increments.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, each time you activate this ability, you can treat it as
      the blink spell, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of
      your normal time flicker duration.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>
