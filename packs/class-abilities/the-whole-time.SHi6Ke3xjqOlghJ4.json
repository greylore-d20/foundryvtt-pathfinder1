      "value": "<p>Mercenaries in the employ of the Aspis Consortium often use wands of @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility} to attack protected targets, then blend into the crowd to escape or disguise the source of the next attack. A rogue with this ability is practiced at attacking from magical concealment. He can use spell-trigger and spellcompletion items as if the following spells were on a spell list to which he has access: @Compendium[pf1.spells.cxgi0ub77t6aink1]{Invisibility, Greater}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility}, and @Compendium[pf1.spells.c11olzqztodz5o5x]{Vanish}.<p>Additionally, if the rogue becomes visible as a result of a weapon or spell attack, he can sheathe his weapon as a free action and instantly adopt a neutral posture. With a successful Bluff or Disguise check (opposed by witnessesâ€™ Sense Motive or Perception checks, whichever is higher), there is no obvious sign that the rogue is the source of the attack (though a lack of any other reasonable candidate can still lead observers to draw the correct conclusion).</p>"
