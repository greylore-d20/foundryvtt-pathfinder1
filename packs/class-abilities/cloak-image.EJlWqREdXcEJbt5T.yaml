  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to hide
      your appearance behind an illusion, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.oj36nfak6jc2s5ky]{Disguise Self}. The effect lasts
      for 1 minute per occultist level you possess.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, you can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to appear
      as a creature of a different type, but you must remain the same size.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to
      target a willing creature other than yourself with this ability.</p>
