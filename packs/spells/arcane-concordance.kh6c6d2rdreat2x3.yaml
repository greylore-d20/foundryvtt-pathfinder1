    value: >-
      <p>A shimmering, blue and gold radiance surrounds you, enhancing arcane
      spells cast by your allies within its area. Any arcane spell cast by a
      creature within the area gains a +1 enhancement bonus to the DC of any
      saving throws against the spell, and can be cast as if one of the
      following metamagic feats was applied to it (without increasing the spell
      level or casting time): Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or
      Still Spell (you choose the metamagic feat when you cast <i>arcane
      concordance</i>).</p>
