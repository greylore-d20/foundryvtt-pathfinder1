  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your experience with lore-filled tomes has granted you the ability to
      cast arcane spells as if they were on your spell list. Once per day, you
      can cast a spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were on your
      list of spells known. The spell consumes a spell slot one level higher
      than the level of the spell. You must have a spellbook containing the
      spell to cast it in this way, and the spell is erased when you complete
      the casting.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
