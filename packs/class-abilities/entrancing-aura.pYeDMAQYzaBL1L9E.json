      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can emit an imperceptible 30-foot aura of distraction as a standard action for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. These rounds need not be consecutive. Enemies within this aura take a â€“5 penalty on Perception checks and are treated as though they had 2 fewer Hit Dice (minimum 1 Hit Die) for the purpose of your effects that would give them the fascinated condition. At 16th level, they are instead treated as if they had 3 fewer Hit Dice for such effects.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Charming Smile power of the Charm Domain.</p>"
