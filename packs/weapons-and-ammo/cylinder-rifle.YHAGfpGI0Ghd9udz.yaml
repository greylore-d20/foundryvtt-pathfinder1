      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><b>Damage</b> 1d6 (small), 1d8 (medium);
      <b>Critical</b> x4; <b>Range</b> 40 ft.; <b>Type</b> B and P</p>

      <p><b>Misfire</b> 1-3 (10 ft.); <b>Capacity</b> 8</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This long-barreled early firearm has a slim horizontal disk with eight
      uncovered slots, each of which can hold one bullet and 1 dose of black
      powder (but not alchemical cartridges).</p>

      <p>Each time the weapon is fired, the disk rotates to load the next
      available shot. Misfiring with a cylinder rifle causes rogue sparks to
      cause the gun to erratically fire all the remaining bullets loaded in the
      disk, and each stray bullet has a 50% chance to hit the wielder, dealing
      1d6 points of damage.</p>

      <p>Reloading a cylinder rifle requires two full-round actions, regardless
      of the number of slots being loaded. The
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.11ClnanF4PdEPd9g]{Rapid Reload} feat reduces this to
      a single full-round action.</p>
