  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, you create up to four motes that shed light
      or darkness in a 20-foot-radius, increasing or decreasing the illumination
      level by up to two categories. You decide whether each individual mote
      sheds light or darkness when the spell is cast.  The <i>Motes of Dusk and
      Dawn</i> must stay within a 10-foot-radius area of one another but
      otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back,
      up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The motes can move
      up to 100 feet per round. A mote winks out if the distance between you and
      it exceeds the spell's range.</p>
