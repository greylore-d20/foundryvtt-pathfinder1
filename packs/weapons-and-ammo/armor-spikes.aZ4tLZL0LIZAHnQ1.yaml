    value: >-
      <p>You can have spikes added to your <em>armor</em>, which allow you to
      deal extra piercing damage on a successful grapple attack. If you are not
      proficient with martial weapons, you take a –4 penalty on grapple checks
      when you try to use armor spikes.</p>

      <p>You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the
      spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. You can’t also make
      an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with
      another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.</p>

      <p>An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes’
      effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own
      right.</p>
