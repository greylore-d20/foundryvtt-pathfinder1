      <p>You blur the lines between mind and body, reassigning ability damage or
      drain your target has taken to a corresponding ability score, as per the

      The transfer of damage can go either way-you can convert Intelligence
      damage to Strength damage and vice versa. You can transfer any number of
      points of damage or drain in a single casting, though only from one
      ability score to the corresponding ability score. You cannot transfer
      enough ability damage or drain to reduce an ability score to 0.<p></p>
