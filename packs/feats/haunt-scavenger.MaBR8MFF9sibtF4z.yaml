      <p><strong>Source</strong> Haunted Heroes Handbook pg. 30</p><p><em>You
      can use spiritual essence to craft magic
      items.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Any one item creation
      feat or Craft (alchemy) 3 ranks.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can
      harvest the ectoplasmic remains of haunts, incorporeal undead, or the like
      to craft magic items. Whenever you encounter a recently neutralized haunt,
      the remains of an incorporeal undead creature, or the remains of a
      creature that has the ability to possess another creature using a racial
      spell-like ability or supernatural ability (such as a ghost or a shadow
      demon), you can attempt to extract material components from those remains
      that are suitable for crafting magic items. You must have access to an
      alchemist’s lab (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 76) in order to extract
      components from a haunt or creature, and you must begin extracting these
      components within 10 minutes of the haunt or creature’s death or
      destruction. After 10 minutes, the components have degraded too much to be
      of any use to you.</p><p>Harvesting components with this feat can take
      several hours. Performing at least 1 minute of work extracting components
      from a haunt or creature prevents its material components from degrading
      further for 24 hours, allowing you to safely suspend and resume harvesting
      these components without fear of subsequent degradation. This ectoplasmic
      residue is portable once the extraction work begins, provided you have a
      vial to contain the source residue (the actual amount of residue is never
      much, physically, but the value of the components you can extract from the
      residue increases with the power of the original haunt or
      creature).</p><p>Each hour, attempt a Craft (alchemy) or a Knowledge
      (religion) check to successfully handle the residue and extract useful
      material. The DC for this check is equal to 15 + the CR of the haunt or
      creature being harvested. If you succeed at the check, you harvest 50 gp
      worth of components. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you can attempt
      to harvest those components again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the
      residue spoils and you cannot scavenge any more from that particular
      source. A single source can yield an amount of components up to a maximum
      value of 50 gp per point of CR before it is depleted.</p><p>Material
      components harvested with Haunt Scavenger can be used in place of the
      material components of enchantment or necromancy spells and extracts,
      provided they are of equal or greater value compared to the spell’s normal
      material components. Additionally, they can be used in place of actual
      gold to fund the construction of a magic item with an enchantment or
      necromancy aura.</p>
