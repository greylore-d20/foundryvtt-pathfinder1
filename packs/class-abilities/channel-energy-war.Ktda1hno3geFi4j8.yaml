  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 4th level, a warpriest can release a wave of energy by
      channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol.
      This energy can be used to deal or heal damage, depending on the type of
      energy channeled and the creatures targeted. Using this ability is a
      standard action that expends two uses of his fervor ability and doesn’t
      provoke an attack of opportunity. The warpriest must present a holy (or
      unholy) symbol to use this ability.</p><p>A good warpriest (or one who
      worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to heal
      living creatures or to deal damage to undead creatures. An evil cleric (or
      one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to
      deal damage to living creatures or heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric
      who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular
      deity) channels positive energy if he chose to spontaneously cast cure
      spells or negative energy if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict
      spells.</p><p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures
      of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the
      warpriest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to the amount
      listed in the fervor ability. Creatures that take damage from channeled
      energy must succeed at a Will saving throw to halve the damage. The save
      DC is 10 + 1/2 the warpriest’s level + the warpriest’s Wisdom modifier.
      Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point
      total—all excess healing is lost. A warpriest can choose whether or not to
      include himself in this effect.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link
