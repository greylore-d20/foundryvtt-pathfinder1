Catapults can hurl a variety of different types of ammunition (the damage given is for stone projectiles; other types of ammunition can be found later in this chapter). They are indirect-fire siege engines.</p><p></p><p> <em>Light</em>: These catapults are Large and often mounted on wheels. The targeting DC of a light catapult is 15. Light catapults have a hardness of 5 and 50 hit points. Light catapult stones cost 10 gp and weigh 50 pounds each. <em>Standard</em>: These Huge siege engines are too large to be transported to the battlefield in one piece, and require assembly. They typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 20). Standard catapults have a hardness of 5 and 100 hit points. Standard catapult stones cost 15 gp and weigh 75 pounds each. <em>Heavy</em>: These Gargantuan siege engines are too large to be transported to the battlefield in one piece, and require assembly.
