  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can tamper with the minds of sleeping
      creatures. You plant a subconscious thought in a sleeping creature’s mind
      by attempting a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the sleeping
      creature’s attitude or request a service from it. If you succeed, when the
      creature wakes it behaves in the way you dictated with the normal
      restrictions for the Diplomacy or Intimidate skill.</p>

      <p>The target of oneiromancy remains unaware of this manipulation, though
      if you fail your Diplomacy check the subject might have its starting
      attitude toward you negatively impacted, as normal. You must be adjacent
      to the sleeping creature to use this ability.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use this ability as part of the casting of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ifcnx1yyw6e7ousm]{Dream},
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.sbjna6uk79pysjv6]{Minor Dream}, or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.siv3ub7hbmcklf8c]{Nightmare}. In this case, the
      oneiromancy effect takes place when the spell is cast.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Charisma modifier. Creatures that don’t dream are immune to this
      effect.</p>
