      <p>This functions as <i>psychic crush I</i>, but the target takes 7d6
      points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful
      Fortitude save and 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Will
      save. The target receives a +2 circumstance bonus on the Fortitude save if
