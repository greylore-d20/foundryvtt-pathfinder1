      <p>This spell wards the attended items of all creatures it targets (items
      held, securely fastened to their person, or in containers on their
      person), enhancing each creature's grip and protecting items from loss or
      theft. The DC of Sleight of Hand checks to remove items warded by the
      spell is increased by 20, and affected creatures gain a +20 bonus to their
      CMDs against disarm and steal combat maneuvers.</p>
