      <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.wniqskqkk0cubu9u]{create
      demiplane}, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the
      plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you <em>create</em>d
      with @Compendium[pf1.spells.r4znakt4ukpebsxg]{lesser create demiplane} or
      <em><em>create</em> demiplane</em> (you do not need to <em>create</em> an
      entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has aduration of 1
      day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add to
      your demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any
      of the features described in <em><em>create</em> demiplane</em>) with each
      casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.</p>

      <p>Energy: Your plane gains the (minor) negative- or positivedominant
      energy trait (see Elemental and Energy Traits, <em>GameMastery Guide</em>
      186). A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant
      energy traits.</p>

      <p>Magic: Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic,
      or wild magic planar trait (see Magic Traits, <em>GameMastery Guide</em>
      187). If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless
      it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If
      you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be
      enhanced or impeded, such as "effects with the fire descriptor or that
      manipulate fire" or "death spells and spells from the Death or Repose
      domains." A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of
      spells.</p>

      <p>Morphic: You may use <em>move earth</em> at will in your demiplane at
      one-tenth of the spell's normal casting time, and can reshape normal
      plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or
      humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this
      ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal.</p>

      <p>Portal: Your demiplane gains a permanent <em>gate</em> to one location
      on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location
      must be very familiar to you.</p>

      <p>This <em>gate</em> is always open and usable from both sides, but you
      can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around
      it).</p>

      <p>Time: By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. By
      selecting this feature, you may make your plane have the erratic time,
      flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time,
      <em>GameMastery Guide</em> 185).</p>

      <p>You can make this spell permanent with the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.nsxngq65mbrzgwnm]{permanency} spell, at a cost of
      22,500 gp. If you have cast <em>create</em> greater demiplane multiple
      times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own
      <em>permanency</em> spell.</p>
