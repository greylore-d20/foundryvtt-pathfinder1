  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This vivid green gel instantly crystallizes into needle-like shards
      upon contact with the air. You can throw a flask of shard gel as a splash
      weapon. A direct hit deals 1d4 points of piercing damage as the shards
      penetrate the target’s flesh. The target’s square and each square adjacent
      to it are covered in shards that function like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.yGrLgCtNMMV9cUvt]{caltrops}. The caltrops
      last for 5 rounds before dissolving into harmless green sludge. Any effect
      that deals sonic damage to an area (such as sound burst or shout)
      immediately destroys all gel shards in that
      area.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (alchemy)</strong> DC
