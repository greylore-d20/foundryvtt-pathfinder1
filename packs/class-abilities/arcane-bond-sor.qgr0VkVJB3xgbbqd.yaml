  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you gain an
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.pW1PNlDcdGl7KuEa]{arcane
      bond}</em>, as a wizard equal to your sorcerer level. Your sorcerer levels
      stack with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers of
      your familiar or bonded object. Once per day, your bonded item allows you
      to cast any one of your spells known (unlike a wizardâ€™s bonded item, which
      allows him to cast any one spell in his spellbook). This ability does not
      allow you to have both a familiar and a bonded item.</p>
