    value: >-
      <p>You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, infusing it with
      the power of divine order and allowing it to treat all attack rolls, skill
      checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round as if the natural
      d20 roll resulted in an 11. You can use this ability a number of times per
      day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
