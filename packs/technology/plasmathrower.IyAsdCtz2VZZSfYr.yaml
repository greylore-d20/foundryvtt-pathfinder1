      is a devastating weapon that fires blasts of superheated, electrically
      charged gas. This weapon has two firing modes: slow-firing and automatic.
      When used on the slowfiring setting, the weapon fires a scattering shot
      with no range increment; on the automatic setting, it fires individual
      bursts of plasma that can reach up to 3 range increments. Half the damage
      dealt by a plasmathrower is fire damage and the other half is electricity
      damage.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 32;
