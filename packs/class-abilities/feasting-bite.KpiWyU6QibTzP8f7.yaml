    value: >-
      <p>This rage power is available to half-orc barbarians. When the barbarian
      confirms a critical hit with her bite attack, she regains a number of hit
      points equal to half the damage dealt.</p>

      <p>The barbarian must have the bloody bite rage power and either the
      animal fury rage power or a natural bite attack before selecting this
      power. Activating this ability consumes 1 round of rage.</p>
