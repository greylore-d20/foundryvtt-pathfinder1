  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, an order of the songbird samurai can speak a few words as
      a swift action, inspiring allies to great deeds. Allies within 30 feet who
      can hear the samurai gain a competence bonus equal to her Charisma
      modifier on attack and weapon damage rolls for 1 round. This ability can
      be used once per combat.</p>
