      <p>This 8-inch-diameter skillet has a long handle and feet so you can rest
      it on a fire or hot coals. Adventurers prefer models with a hinged handle
      that folds over the top of the skillet for easier storage and transport. A
      mithral skillet is lighter and food rarely sticks to it.</p>
