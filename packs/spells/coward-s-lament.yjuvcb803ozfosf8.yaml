    value: >-
      <p>You compel an opponent to face you in combat, or suffer for its
      cowardice. Each round that the target fails to attack you in melee, it
      receives a cumulative -1 penalty to its Armor Class, attack rolls, and
      saving throws (maximum penalty -5). Each round at the end of its turn, the
      target may attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the penalties from
      increasing for that round. All penalties reset to zero when the target
      attacks you in melee, but increase again if it stops attacking. If the
      target is prevented from attacking you by physical restraint, magic, or
      impassable terrain, the penalties do not increase. If you move away from
      the target, the spell ends.</p>
