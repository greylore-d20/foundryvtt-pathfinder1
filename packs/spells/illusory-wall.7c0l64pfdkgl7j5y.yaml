    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar
      surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can
      pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits,
      traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight
      work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the
      surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear.
      Although the caster can see through his <i>illusory wall</i>, other
      creatures cannot, even if they succeed at their will save (but they do
      learn that it is not real).</p>
