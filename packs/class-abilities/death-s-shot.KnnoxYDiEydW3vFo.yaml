  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a critical hit, she can spend
      1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a
      Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level
      + the gunslinger’s Dexterity modifier. On a failed saving throw, the
      target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow
      the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a critical hit or making a
      killing blow.</p>
