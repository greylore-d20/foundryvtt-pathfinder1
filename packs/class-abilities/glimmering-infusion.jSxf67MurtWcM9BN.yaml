    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist can expend any prepared extract to produce a cube of
      glowing motes that act as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ec2zmvdzi4m3puh4]{Glitterdust}. The area must be
      adjacent to the alchemist and covers one 5-foot square per level of
      extract sacrificed, and the effectâ€™s save DC is calculated using the level
      of the sacrificed extract. The alchemist must have the infusion discovery
      to choose this discovery.</p>
