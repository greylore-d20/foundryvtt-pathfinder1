      <p>You transform a source of open flame within 120 feet into a cloud of
      choking smoke, filling a 20-foot-radius spread and affecting vision like a
      smokestick. All creatures that begin their turns inside the area become
      sickened as long as they remain in the smoke and for 1d4+1 rounds
      thereafter (Fortitude negates).</p>
