    value: >-
      <p>As a move action, you can alter the amount of light shed by any
      nonmagical light source within 60 feet so that its light radius is either
      halved or doubled.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, you can affect light sources up to the size of a
      torch.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, you can affect any Medium or smaller nonmagical light
      source (such as a campfire).</p>

      <p>At 14th level, you can affect Large or smaller nonmagical light sources
      (such as bonfires) and magical light sources up to the size of an
      everburning torch. If a creature is holding the light source you are
      trying to affect, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the
      effect.</p>
