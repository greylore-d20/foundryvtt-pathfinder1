    value: >-
      <p>You focus emotional energy and weave it into a shroud of hardened
      ectoplasm around the weapon you touch, infusing it with a ghostly glow and
      great power. The weapon becomes a <i>ghost touch</i> weapon, and gains one
      of the following additional benefits, depending on the type of emotion you
      infuse into the weapon. If a special ability wouldn't apply to the chosen
      weapon (such as <i>vicious</i> on a ranged weapon), the weapon doesn't
      gain that benefit. <b>Anger</b>: The weapon also gains the <i>vicious</i>
      special ability. <b>Dedication</b>: The weapon also gains the
      <i>returning</i> special ability. <b>Despair</b>: The weapon also gains
      the <i>cruel</i> special ability. <b>Fear</b>: The weapon also gains the
      menacing special ability. <b>Hatred</b>: The weapon also gains the
      <i>cunning</i> special ability. <b>Jealousy</b>: The weapon also gains the
      <i>mimetic</i> special ability. <b>Zeal</b>: The weapon also gains the
      <i>keen</i> special ability.  If you are a spiritualist and the type of
      emotional energy you choose matches the emotional focus of your phantom,
      the weapon grants its wielder a +2 bonus on skill checks with both skills
      you gain Skill Focus in from your phantom's emotional focus.</p>
