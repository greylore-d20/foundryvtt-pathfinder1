    value: >-
      <p>You create a low-cresting wave of water that carries the target along
      the surface of water or the ground. When moving across level ground, the
      target's speed increases by 10 feet.</p><p>If going downhill, speed
      increases by 20 feet instead, but <i>slipstream</i> provides no movement
      bonus when going uphill.</p><p>While swimming, the <i>slipstream</i>
      increases the target's swim speed by 20 feet-if the target does not have a
      swim speed, this spell grants a swim speed of 20 ft.</p>
