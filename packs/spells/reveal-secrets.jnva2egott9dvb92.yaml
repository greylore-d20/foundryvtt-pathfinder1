    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, you ask the target whether it has a secret
      about a specific topic that can be described in 10 words or fewer. This
      can concern a person, place, or thing (such as a town's mayor, the ring
      worn by a traveling merchant, or the bridge spanning a nearby river) or an
      easily distinguished event (such as a historic battle or a recent rash of
      disappearances). If the target knows a secret about the topic (information
      it believes isn't common knowledge and which it would not normally tell
      you), it states it has a secret. The target doesn't mention anything about
      the secret and doesn't remember telling you it has a secret. If the target
      succeeds at its saving throw, it isn't compelled to reveal whether it
      knows a secret and is aware that you asked.</p>
