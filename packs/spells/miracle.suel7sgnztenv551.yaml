      <p>You don't so much cast a <em>miracle</em> as request one. You state
      what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the
      power you pray to for spells) intercede.</p><p>A <em>miracle</em> can do
      any of the following things.</p><ul><li><p>Duplicate any cleric spell of
      8th level or lower.</p></li><li><p>Duplicate any other spell of 7th level
      or lower.</p></li><li><p>Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such
      as <em>feeblemind</em> or <em>insanity.</em></p></li><li>Have any effect
      whose power level is in line with the above
      effects.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful
      request. Casting such a <em>miracle</em> costs the cleric 25,000 gp in
      powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved.
      Examples of especially powerful <em>miracle</em>s of this sort could
      include the following:</p><ul><li><p>Swinging the tide of a battle in your
      favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</p></li><li><p>Moving
      you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a
      specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of
      error.</p></li><li>Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic
      eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</li></ul><p>In any
      event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's)
      nature is refused.</p><p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell
      resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When
      a <em>miracle</em> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that
      costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.</p>
