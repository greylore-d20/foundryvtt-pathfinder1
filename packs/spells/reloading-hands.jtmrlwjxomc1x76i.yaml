      <p>Once per round, phantom hands load a single ranged weapon or firearm
      with conjured ammunition. This ammunition counts as magical for overcoming
      damage reduction and attacking incorporeal creatures, but is the standard
      for its type (a normal bullet or pellets and black powder in the case of
      firearms). Conjured ammunition ceases to exist 1 round after it is removed
      from the weapon, or at the end of the duration, whichever comes first.</p>
