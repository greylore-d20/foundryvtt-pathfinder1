      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>A shuriken is a small piece of metal with sharpened edges, designed for
      throwing. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon. Although they are
      thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of
      drawing them and crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of
      them, and of what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>
