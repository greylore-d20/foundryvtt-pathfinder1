She automatically receives a save to disbelieve any illusion she can see each round at the start of her turn, even if she hasn’t interacted with it. If she fails a saving throw against an illusion that is not to disbelieve, she can attempt to save again again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw.</p>"
