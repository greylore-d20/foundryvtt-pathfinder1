  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You compel an unconscious or sleeping creature to rise and move in a
      half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or guided, but
      remains helpless for all other purposes.</p><p>The subject moves at half
      speed and is limited to a single move action each round. It is not capable
      of moving at a higher rate of speed or taking actions other than movement
      except by magical assistance, and automatically fails any Dexterity- or
      Strength-based skill checks. If the creature takes any damage while
      <i>sleepwalking</i> it must make a new saving throw or the spell ends and
      the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When the spell
      ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must be awoken
      normally. While <i>sleepwalk</i> allows an unconscious creature to move,
      it does not awaken the creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise heal
      them. A disabled creature that moves about while under the effects of this
      spell does not start dying again as a result of this movement.</p>
