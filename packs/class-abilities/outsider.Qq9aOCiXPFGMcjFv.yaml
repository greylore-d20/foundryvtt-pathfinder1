  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, your natural form becomes an animal-headed
      <em>humanoid</em>, like a true rakshasa. This does not affect your ability
      to speak or cast spells. You can use your <em>alter self</em> or other
      disguise and <em>polymorph</em> abilities to assume your original form or
      other forms when it suits you. You are forevermore treated as a
      <em>native</em> <em>outsider</em> rather than as a <em>humanoid</em> (or
      whatever your original type was) for the purpose of spells and other
      magical effects. Unlike other <em>outsiders</em>, you can still be brought
      back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type.
      You gain <em>DR</em> 10/piercing.</p>
