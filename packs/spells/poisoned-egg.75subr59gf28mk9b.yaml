  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You transform the contents of a normal egg into a single dose of small
      centipede poison (injury; <i>save</i> DC 11; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for
      4 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1 Dex; <i>cure</i> 1 <i>save</i>). The poison
      reverts to a normal egg at the end of the spell's duration (the reverted
      egg substance is harmless unless the poisoned creature is vulnerable to
      eggs). The egg may be raw or cooked but must be whole and not empty when
      you cast the spell. When applying the poisoned egg's contents to a weapon,
      the wielder has no chance of poisoning herself, as though she had the
      poison use class feature.</p>
