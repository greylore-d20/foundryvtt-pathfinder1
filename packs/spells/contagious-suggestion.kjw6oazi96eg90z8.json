    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions as per <i>suggestion</i>, except the target can pass on the enchantment to other targets. The target is compelled to communicate your <i>suggestion</i> to another creature, forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the <i>suggestion</i> effect on the initial target isn't negated. If a secondary target fails, it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread the <i>suggestion</i>. This spell can affect a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level. Creatures that save against this spell cannot be affected by that particular casting of contagious <i>suggestion</i> for 24 hours.</p>"
