      <p>This spell allows you to reconstruct past events that occurred in your
      current location based on the tracks and other signs left behind.
      <i>Replay tracks</i> reveals events that occurred while the tracks that
      serve as the focus for the spell were being left, revealing events in the
      order they happened in real time or in reverse, depending on whether you
      are following the tracks forward or backward, although the image isn't
      clear enough to make out details (such as a creature's exact identity).
      You can attempt Survival checks to follow tracks as part of concentrating
      on the spell, but only events connected to the tracks used as the focus of
      the spell are revealed by the spell. Elements that left no trace
      detectable by you, such as creatures benefitting from <i>pass without
      trace</i>, are absent from the events you visualize.</p>
