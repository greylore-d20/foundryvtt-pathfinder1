    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can choose one
      manufactured weapon you wield, shield you wield, or piece of armor you
      wear to gain the benefit of @Compendium[pf1.spells.zq7xi7l5vgpqu7rt]{Magic
      Weapon, Greater} (weapon) or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.73han2zqxg59u18g]{Magic Vestment}. The caster level
      of this effect is equal to your bloodrager level, and its effects end when
      your bloodrage ends or when you no longer wear or wield the weapon,
      shield, or armor.</p>
