  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can expend 1 point of mental focus as a standard action to create
      an invisible sensor within 30 feet that watches a 5-foot-square area.
      Whenever any creature enters that square, you receive a mental image of
      the creature as long as you are on the same plane as the sensor.</p>

      <p>The sensor remains active for 10 minutes per occultist level you
      possess. The image will not wake you from slumber, although you do receive
      all of the images the sensor collected once you wake up. The sensor can be
      deceived by invisibility and similar magic.</p>

      <p>You can expend additional points of mental focus when creating the eye
      to increase the size of the square by 5 feet per additional point spent
      (to 10 feet square, 15 feet square, and so on).</p>
