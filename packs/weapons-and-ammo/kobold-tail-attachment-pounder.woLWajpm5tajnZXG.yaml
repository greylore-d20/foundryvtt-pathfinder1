  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A kobold with the Tail Terror feat (see below) can slip this device
      over the tip of his tail to augment his natural attack. Each tail
      attachment provides just enough weight, balance, and striking power to
      increase the damage of his tail slap. It takes a full-round action to slip
      on a kobold tail attachment, and the kobold gains a +4 bonus against
      disarm attempts made to remove his tail attachment.</p><p>While a kobold
      is wearing a kobold tail attachment, the attack deals the tail attachment
      damage, and some attachments gain a special feature. Tail attachments are
      light weapons and can be improved by feats that can improve weapon attacks
      (such as Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization). All kobold tail
      attachments make up a kobold tail attachment weapon group that can be
      improved by the fighter's weapon training class ability. Tail attachments
      can be constructed of special material and made into masterwork or magic
      items. There are five types of common tail
      attachments.</p><p><strong>Pounder</strong>: This squat ball is made from
      some sort of dull metal.</p>
