Each creature within 30 feet that is either a resident of his chosen settlement or whose alignment is within one step of the cavalier’s settlement gains a morale bonus on saving throws equal to the cavalier’s Charisma modifier for 1 round. This bonus doubles if a creature meets both requirements. The cavalier can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>"
