While regenerating in this way, you are not affected by spells or effects that would cause you to continue&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying\">dying</a>, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bleed\">bleed</a>, but if you take any acid or fire damage, you stop regenerating for the rest of the day (but remain stabilized) and you are affected by such effects as normal. You still die if your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;reach a negative number equal to your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;score, regardless of whether you are regenerating.
