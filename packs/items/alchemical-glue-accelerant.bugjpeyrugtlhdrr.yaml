      <p>This tiny dropper contains a liquid that speeds up the cure time of
      alchemical glue. Applying the accelerant is a standard action. Accelerated
      glue is tacky after 1 round and fully cured in 1 minute. The dropper
      contains 20 doses; each dose is sufficient to cure one small application
      of alchemical glue. The entire dropper must be used to cure a full square
      foot of glue.</p>
