  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>interposing hand</i>, except that it can
      also grapple one opponent as <i>grasping hand</i>. Its CMB and CMD for
      grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus,
      with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being
      Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A <i>crushing
      hand</i> deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check
      against an opponent. The <i>crushing hand</i> can instead be directed to
      bull rush a target (as <i>forceful hand</i>), using the same bonuses
      outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as
      <i>interposing hand</i> does.</p>
