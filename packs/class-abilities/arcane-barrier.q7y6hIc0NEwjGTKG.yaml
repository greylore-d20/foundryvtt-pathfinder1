  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane
      reservoir to create a barrier of magic that protects her from harm. This
      barrier grants the arcanist a number of temporary hit points equal to her
      arcanist level + her Charisma modif ier, and lasts for 1 minute per
      arcanist level or until all the temporary hit points have been lost.</p>

      <p>Each additional time per day the arcanist uses this ability, the number
      of arcane reservoir points she must spend to activate it increases by 1
      (so the second time it is used, the arcanist must expend 2 points from her
      arcane reservoir, 3 points for the third time, and so on). The temporary
      hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional
      uses do cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to
      reset.</p>
