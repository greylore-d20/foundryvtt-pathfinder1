            <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot
            radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional
            20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light
            becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in
            normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it
            as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
            equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire
            damage.</p>

            <h3>Magic Containers</h3>

            <p>Magic containers come in almost as many varieties as there are
            <em>alchemists</em>, and so are of inestimable value to
            <em>alchemists</em> with specific needs. Some of the most well-known
            magic containers are described here.</p>

            <p>Because of a varied nature of alchemical items and their effects,
            not all combinations of alchemical items and magic bottles are
            viable or even make sense, even though they technically might be
            allowed by the rules. The GM should have the final say on whether or
            not a particular alchemical item can function within one of the
            magical containers listed in this section.</p>
