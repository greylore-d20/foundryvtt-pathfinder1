    value: >-
      <p>A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all
      Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint
      and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesnâ€™t have Combat Expertise or an
      Intelligence score of at least 13.</p>

      <p>He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as
      prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater
      Feint.</p>
