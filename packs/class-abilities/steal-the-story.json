If the check succeeds, the target takes a penalty on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against anyone who heard the altered story. This penalty is equal to the rogue’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus (whichever is highest), and lasts until the target is able to repair his reputation or discredit the rogue. The rogue must have the obfuscate story talent to select this talent.</p>"
