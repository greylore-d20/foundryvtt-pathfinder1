  shortDescription: >-
    <p>If you cast <i>tidal surge</i> on land, you create an onrushing surge of
    water 10 feet high in a 30-foot cone that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning
    damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level) and
    extinguishes all nonmagical fires in the area. Magical fire effects in the
    area of a <i>tidal surge</i> are affected as if you had cast <i>dispel
    magic</i>. In addition to taking damage, creatures that fail their Reflex
    saves are pushed 1d4x5 feet away from you, and Medium or smaller creatures
    are also knocked prone.</p><p>If you cast this spell in or on a body of
    water at least 30 feet across, you can shape the spell either as the cone
    described above or as a 60-foot line. In either shape, the water deals 1d10
    points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have in addition
    to pushing away creatures that fail their Reflex saves.</p>
