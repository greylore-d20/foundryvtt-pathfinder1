  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You fill a creature's mind with the realization of its earthly weight and
    responsibilities. Disheartened and wearied by these thoughts, the creature
    gains heavy encumbrance and is unable to fly (if already flying, it must
    land as soon as possible). If the creature is three or more size categories
    larger than you, it's also staggered.</p>
