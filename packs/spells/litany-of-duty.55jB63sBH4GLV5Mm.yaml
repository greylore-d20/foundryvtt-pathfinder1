    value: >-
      <p>You repeat a mantra or phrase that reminds you of your duty. You can
      immediately reroll a failed saving throw against a spell that would force
      you to take an action against your will, and you gain a +2 bonus against
      enchantment effects for 1 round. You can use this spell to reroll only a
      saving throw that you failed within the past round. While subject to this
      spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word
      “litany” in the title.</p>
