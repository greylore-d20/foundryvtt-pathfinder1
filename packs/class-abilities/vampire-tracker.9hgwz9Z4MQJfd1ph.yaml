  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, the vampire hunter can track gaseous creatures—such as
      <em>vampires</em> flying or moving in <em>gaseous form</em>—as though they
      were leaving physical tracks. The base DC of <em>Survival</em> checks to
      track gaseous creatures is 20. The modifiers for surfaces don’t apply (as
      a gaseous creature leaves no impressions during its passage) but other
      conditions do.</p>
