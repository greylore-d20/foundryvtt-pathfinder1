      <p>You can change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can
      create sounds where none exist, deaden sounds, or transform sounds into
      other sounds. All affected creatures or objects must be transmuted in the
      same way. Once the transmutation is made, you cannot change it. You can
      change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words with which you are
      unfamiliar yourself.</p><p>A spellcaster whose voice is changed
      dramatically is unable to cast spells with verbal components.</p>
