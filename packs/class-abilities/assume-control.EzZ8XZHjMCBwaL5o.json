      "value": "<p>At 1st level, you can attempt to gain control over a summoned creature by disrupting the bond between it and the caster who summoned it. You must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) equal to 10 + the summoning caster’s level. If you know the summoned creature’s name, you receive a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on the check. If the check is successful, you can control the summoned creature as if you had summoned it for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your <em>wizard</em> level (minimum 1 round). This does not increase the duration of the original summoning. The original summoning caster can attempt to regain control of the summoned creature as a <em>standard action</em> by making a caster level check against your caster level + 10. When your control ends, the creature reverts to the control of its <em>summoner</em>.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can use this ability to bargain with called creatures as if you were the caster who conjured them. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>"
