      <p>This spell functions like <i>teleport,</i> except that it teleports an
      object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be
      teleported.</p><p>If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant
      location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the
      object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved.
      A successful targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell cast on that point brings
      the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.</p>
