  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell was created by the paladins of the Mendevian Crusades, and
    co-opted by inquisitors and rangers dedicated to tracking and fighting
    demons, devils, and other evil extraplanar creatures.</p><p>When you cast
    this spell on a melee weapon you imbue it with a powerful <i>holy</i>
    energy, granting the weapon the <i>bane</i> weapon quality against evil
    outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit against
    an outsider with the evil subtype, you not only deal normal critical damage
    with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3 rounds-the outsider
    can reduce this nauseated condition to sickened for 1 round with a
    successful Fortitude save.</p>
