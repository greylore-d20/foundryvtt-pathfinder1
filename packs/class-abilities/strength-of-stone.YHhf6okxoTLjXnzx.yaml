  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, your flesh becomes as hard as stone, giving you
      <em>DR</em> 10/<em>adamantine</em>, and you become immune to
      petrification. You suffer no penalties while squeezing through tight
      spaces and are immune to <em>bull rush</em>, <em>drag</em>,
      <em>grapple</em>, <em>reposition</em>, and <em>trip</em> maneuvers, and to
      push and pull effects as long as you are standing on the ground.</p>
