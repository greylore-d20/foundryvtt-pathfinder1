The echo-producing noises are too highpitched to be heard by most creatures, and can only be detected by dragons, other creatures with this ability (such as bats), and creatures with hearing-based blindsense or blindsight. You cannot use this ability if you are deaf, and cannot detect anything in an area of <i>silence</i>.</p>"
