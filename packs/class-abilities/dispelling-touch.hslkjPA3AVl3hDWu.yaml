        <p>One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <em>dispel
        magic</em> spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level)
        and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the
        spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends.</p><p>If not,
        compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level.
        Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the
        target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p><p>dispel magic,
        targeting a creature affected by <em>stoneskin</em> (caster level 12th)
        and <em>fly</em> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a
        19. This check is not high enough to end the <em>stoneskin</em> (which
        would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the
        <em>fly</em> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted
        in a 23 or higher, the <em>stoneskin</em> would have been dispelled,
        leaving the <em>fly</em> intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less,
        no spells would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted
        dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell
        affecting an area (such as a <em>wall of</em> fire). You must name the
        specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level
        check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other
        spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high
        enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or
        creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster
        <em>summoned</em> by <em>summon</em> monster), you make a dispel check
        to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the
        object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against
        the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you
        succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4
        rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A
        suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An
        interdimensional opening (such as a <em>bag of</em> holding) is
        temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A
        suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact).
        Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as
        this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any
        spell that you cast yourself.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, you can use a targeted
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{dispel magic} effect as
      a melee touch attack. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level
      and one additional time per day for every four cleric levels beyond
      8th.</p>
