      <p><em>Your critical hits blind your
      opponents.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.JNlMhMhcDO8wkXiw]{Critical Focus}, base
      attack bonus +15.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Whenever you score a
      critical hit, your opponent is permanently blinded. A successful Fortitude
      save reduces this to dazzled for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save
      is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on
      creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more than
      two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the
      GM's discretion). Blindness can be cured by heal, regeneration, remove
      blindness, or similar abilities.</p><p><strong>Special</strong>: You can
      only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless
      you possess Critical Mastery.</p><h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>When you confirm
      a critical hit and attempt to blind an opponent with this feat, you can
      spend up to 5 stamina points to increase the DC of this feat's saving
      throw by an amount equal to the number of stamina points you spent.</p>
