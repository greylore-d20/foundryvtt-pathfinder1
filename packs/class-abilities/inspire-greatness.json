      "value": "<p>A bard of 9th level or higher can use his performance to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally while using this performance (up to a maximum of four at 18th level). To inspire greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus&nbsp;<em>Hit Dice</em>&nbsp;(d10s), the commensurate number of&nbsp;<em>temporary hit points</em>&nbsp;(apply the targetâ€™s&nbsp;<em>Constitution</em>&nbsp;modifier, if any, to these bonus&nbsp;<em>Hit Dice</em>), a +2&nbsp;<em>competence bonus</em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<em>attack rolls</em>, and a +1&nbsp;<em>competence bonus</em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<em>Fortitude</em>&nbsp;saves. The bonus&nbsp;<em>Hit Dice</em>&nbsp;count as regular&nbsp;<em>Hit Dice</em>&nbsp;for determining the effect of spells that are&nbsp;<em>Hit Dice</em>&nbsp;dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.</p>"
