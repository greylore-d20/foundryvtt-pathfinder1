      <p>This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the
      affected creatures, but <i>calm emotions</i> can stop raging creatures
      from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot
      take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything
      destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed
      creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.</p><p>This
      spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses
      granted by spells such as <i>bless</i>, <i>good hope</i>, and <i>rage</i>,
      and also negates a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage
      ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused
      condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell,
      condition, or effect has no effect. When the <i>calm emotions spell</i>
      ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again,
      provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</p>
