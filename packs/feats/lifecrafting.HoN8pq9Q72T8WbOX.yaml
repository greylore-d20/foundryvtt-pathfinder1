      <p><em>Your crafting skill and the secret knowledge of your people allows
      you to create new wyrwoods.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.DMSYzt5jD9vk0DGy]{Craft Construct},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.R3a1OV18RwDJftvq]{Leadership},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.races.Item.PsRZOF49ZKtorZbs]{wyrwood}.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>:
      By completing a unique ritual, you can create a wyrwood. While you can use
      any Small wooden construct to create the base of a wyrwood, infusing it
      with life and consciousness requires a specific process. The process
      requires a flawless ioun stone worth at least 10,000 gp. For the ritual to
      succeed, you must spend 1 month in complete isolation with the construct
      that will become a wyrwood. Each week, you must succeed at a DC 30 Craft
      (carpentry) or Craft (sculpture) check. Failure requires you to start
      again, although the materials can be reused. Over this time, the construct
      reshapes itself around the ioun stone until it finds the form it will take
      permanentlyâ€” thus even non-humanoid constructs become humanoid as they
      become wyrwoods. While wyrwoods are born as fully formed adults, they lack
      any skill or training, so they have only 1 level in the commoner
      class.</p>
