      <p>The target becomes unable to speak the truth. Lies the target speaks
      don't need to be convincing, nor do they even need to be consistent, but
      they can't be true as far as the target is aware. This extends to
      non-verbal communication, such as hand signs or written notes. The spell
      allows talking in metaphors and talking about fictional figures.  The
      spell doesn't affect the target's ability to say things that are neither
      true nor false, such as questions, commands, or verbal spell components.
      If the target of this spell is simultaneously compelled to tell the truth
      (for instance, by being within a <i>zone of</i> truth), the target is only
      able to say things that are neither true nor false.</p>
