      Groups</b> Flails</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A flying blade is a large,
      crescent-shaped blade anchored to a 10-foot chain. You fight with a flying
      blade by spinning it about your head or by snapping it toward an opponent.
      Because the flying blade is a clumsy weapon, you receive a -2 penalty on
      attack rolls with it, but when you make attacks of opportunity provoked by
      movement, you receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls instead of the
      penalty.</p>
