      "value": "<p>Once per day, an eidolon can become incorporeal for 1 round per summoner level. While in this form, the eidolon gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal quality. It only takes half damage from corporeal sources as long as they are magic (it takes no damage from nonmagical weapons and objects). Likewise, its spells or spell-like abilities deal only half damage to corporeal creatures. Spells and other effects that do not deal damage function normally.</p>\n<p>The summoner must be at least 15th level before selecting this evolution.</p>"
