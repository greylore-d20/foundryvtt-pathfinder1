    value: >-
      <p>The witch empowers herself or an ally within 30 feet with poisonous
      nails. The affected creature gains a claw attack as a secondary attack
      that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for Small creatures) and has the
      following poison ability:</p><fieldset><legend>Witch
      Toxin</legend><p>Claw—injury; save Fort DC 10 + half the witch’s level +
      the witch’s Intelligence modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d2 Str; cure 1 save.</p></fieldset><p>The creature gains this claw attack
      for a number of minutes equal to the witch’s level. If the target already
      has a claw attack, that attack gains the poison ability listed above, but
      the DC is 1 higher.</p><p>Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it
      cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.</p>
