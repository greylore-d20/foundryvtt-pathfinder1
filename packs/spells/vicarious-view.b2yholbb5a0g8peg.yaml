      <p>You plant a scrying sensor on a touched creature, object, or point in
      space, allowing you to see and hear the creature, object, or point and its
      surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions). If the creature or
      object on moves, the sensor moves with it. Unlike other scrying spells,
      <i>vicarious view</i> doesn't allow magically or supernaturally enhanced
      senses to work through it.</p>
