  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, once per day, you can unravel the fibers of reality and
      ride along them as they snap back into place. This power functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{Dimension Door}, while also
      creating a mass of @Compendium[pf1.spells.wralcmyi4tdcai24]{Black
      Tentacles} centered on your former location. Both of these effects use
      your sorcerer level as the <em>caster level</em>. At 20th level, you can
      use this ability twice per day.</p>
