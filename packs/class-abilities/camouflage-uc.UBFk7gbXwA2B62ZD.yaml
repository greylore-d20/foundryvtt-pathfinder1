  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent can craft simple but effective camouflage from
      the surrounding foliage. The rogue needs 1 minute to prepare the
      camouflage, but once she does, it is effective for the rest of the day or
      until the rogue fails a saving throw against an area-effect spell that
      deals acid, cold, or fire damage, whichever comes first.</p>

      <p>The rogue gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks while within terrain that
      matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability cannot be
      used in areas without natural foliage.</p>
