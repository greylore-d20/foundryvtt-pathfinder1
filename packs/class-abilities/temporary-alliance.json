      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, an order of the eel cavalier gains the ability to create a meaningful, if temporary, alliance with another individual. As a full-round action, the cavalier enters into an alliance with a willing creature that has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The creature thereafter receives a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls against targets the cavalier threatens and on saving throws against spells and effects generated by those targets. These bonuses last for 1 hour for every 2 cavalier levels the order of the eel cavalier has or until the cavalier creates a new alliance with a different creature. A cavalier can have only one alliance active at a time; if he creates a new alliance while under the effects of an existing alliance, the existing alliance immediately ends and the new one takes effect.</p>"
