      <p>One side of this 8-foot-long scarf is reinforced with chain links and
      metal plates. While not enough to provide a benefit to <em>Armor
      Class</em>, these versatile scarves can be used like a length of chain to
      climb short distances or bind an enemy. A reinforced scarf has
      <em>hardness</em> 10 and 4 <em>hit points</em>. It can be burst with a DC
      24 <em>Strength</em> check.</p>
