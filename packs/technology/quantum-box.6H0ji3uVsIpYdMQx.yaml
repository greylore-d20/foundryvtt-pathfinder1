      charges</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This silvery box holds up to 1 cubic
      foot of items or material. Quantum boxes always exist as a pair. When
      activated as a standard action, a quantum box connects to its mate, at
      which point they trade contents. A quantum box must be activated again to
      switch the contents back. Effects that prevent dimensional travel block
      activation of a quantum box, but items that block signals do not. This
      effect works only if both quantum boxes are located on the same
      plane.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 32;
