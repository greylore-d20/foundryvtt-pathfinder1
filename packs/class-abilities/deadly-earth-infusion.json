The ground roils and buckles beneath the affected area. All creatures and objects in contact with the ground within the area when you create it automatically take 1/4 of the normal damage from your blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the area, it takes half the normal damage from your blast, as do creatures that end their turns in the area. The entire area counts as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>This infusion lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use it again.</p>"
