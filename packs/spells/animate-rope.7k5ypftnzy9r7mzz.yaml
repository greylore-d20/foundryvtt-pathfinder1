  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can animate a nonliving rope-like object. The maximum length
      assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50%
      for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each
      reduction of the rope's diameter by half.</p><p>The possible commands are
      "coil" (form a neat, coiled stack), "coil and knot," "loop," "loop and
      knot," "tie and knot," and the opposites of all of the above ("uncoil,"
      and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if
      directing an active spell.</p><p>The rope can enwrap only a creature or an
      object within 1 foot of it - it does not snake outward - so it must be
      thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged
      touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter
      hemp rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to
      burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line
      or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become
      entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell
      must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level to
      cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape
      Artist check.</p><p>The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not
      magical.</p><p>The spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a
      creature.</p>
