  shortDescription: >-
    <p>By casting <i>zone of silence</i>, you manipulate sound waves in your
    immediate vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area can
    converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices or any other
    noises from within, including language-dependent or sonic spell effects.
    This effect is centered on you and moves with you.</p><p>Anyone who enters
    the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave are
    no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful DC 20 Linguistics check
    to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a <i>zone of
    silence</i>.</p>
