  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A barbarianâ€™s mount can affect creatures up to its own size with its
      ferocious trample. In addition, it can make an overrun combat maneuver
      check as a free action against a creature that fails its Reflex save (or
      chooses not to save in order to take an attack of opportunity) against its
      trample.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the ferocious trample rage power to select this
      rage power.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
