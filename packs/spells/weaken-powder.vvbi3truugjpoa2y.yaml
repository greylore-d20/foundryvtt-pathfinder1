    value: >-
      <p>Ammunition in the target firearm generates less of an explosive charge
      when fired. With such ammunition, the firearm's range increment is halved
      and the firer takes a -2 penalty on damage rolls. If aware of this spell's
      effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to
      identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can
      spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm.
      Doing so destroys that ammunition.</p>
