      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      Yes<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes<p>Celestial creatures dwell in the
      higher planes, but can be summoned using spells such as summon monster and
      planar ally. A celestial creature’s CR increases by +1 only if the base
      creature has 5 or more HD. A celestial creature’s quick and rebuild rules
      are the same.<p><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> Senses gains darkvision 60 ft.;
      Defensive Abilities gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the table;
      SR gains SR equal to new CR +5; Special Attacks smite evil 1/day as a
      swift action (adds Cha bonus to attack rolls and damage bonus equal to HD
      against evil foes; smite persists until target is dead or the celestial
      creature rests).</p>
