      <p>Your presence inspires incredible awe in those nearby. A creature that
      fails a save against this spell falls to the ground and prostrates itself
      before you, believing it bows before a divine presence. A flying creature
      incapable of hovering must land immediately in order to prostrate itself.
      These creatures are considered to be helpless for the duration of the
      spell.</p><p>Each round on its turn, a target of this spell may attempt a
      new saving throw to end the effect; this is a full-round action that does
      not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature that recovers from this
      spell early after being affected by it for at least 1 round takes 1d6
      points of Wisdom drain and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A creature that
      makes the initial save to resist this spell is merely staggered for 1
      round.</p>
