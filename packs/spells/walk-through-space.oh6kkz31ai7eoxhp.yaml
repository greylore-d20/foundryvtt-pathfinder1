  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When under the effects of this spell, you can teleport up to 30 feet as
      a move action. You must end this movement in an unoccupied space that you
      can stand on within line of sight. Alternatively, you can spend a move
      action to teleport to a standing position from lying prone. Teleporting
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
