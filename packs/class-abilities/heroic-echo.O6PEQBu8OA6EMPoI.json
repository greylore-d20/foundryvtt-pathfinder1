      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, when you receive a <em>morale bonus</em> from any spell, <em>spell-like ability</em>, or magic item, including those you cast on yourself, that bonus increases by +1. At 9th level, this ability also applies to competence bonuses. If you receive a morale effect (or a competence effect at 9th level) that affects an area or multiple targets, as an <em>immediate action</em> you can share your increased bonus with all other recipients. This increase to other participants lasts a number of rounds equal to your <em>Charisma</em> bonus. You can use this ability once per day, plus one time per three levels after 3rd.</p>"
