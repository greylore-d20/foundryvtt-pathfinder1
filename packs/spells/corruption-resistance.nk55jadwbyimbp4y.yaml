  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You grant the touched creature limited protection from magical effects
      that inflict damage based on the target creature's alignment, such as
      <i>holy smite</i>, order's wrath, a paladin's smite evil attack, or an
      <i>unholy</i> weapon. Choose one alignment type: chaos, evil, good, or
      law. The subject takes 5 less points of damage from effects that
      specifically harm creatures of that alignment. The value of the protection
      increases to 10 points at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell
      protects the recipient's equipment as well.</p><p><i>Corruption
      resistance</i> protects against spells, spell-like abilities, and special
      abilities, not physical attacks. <i>Corruption resistance</i> only
      protects against damage. The subject can still suffer side effects from
      such attacks. When you use this spell to protect an alignment, it gains
      the descriptor of that alignment.</p>
