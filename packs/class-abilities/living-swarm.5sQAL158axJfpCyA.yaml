    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you and the machines within you become one. Your nanites
      consume and replicate your body, allowing swift and radical physical
      alterations with little more than a thought. You become immune to
      <em>bleed</em> effects, diseases, and poisons, and gain <em>DR</em> 5/â€”.
      At will, you can break down your body and move in a shimmering stream of
      flying nanites, as if affected by
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous Form}.</p>
