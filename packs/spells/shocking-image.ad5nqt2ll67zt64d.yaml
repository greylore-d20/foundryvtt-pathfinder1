  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell works like <i>mirror image</i>, except the illusory doubles
      it creates discharge an electric shock when destroyed. An opponent that
      uses a melee attack to destroy one of your images takes 2d6 points of
      electricity damage. You must overcome a target's spell resistance the
      first time you deal this electricity damage to it. Failure renders the
      target immune to damage from this spell.</p>
