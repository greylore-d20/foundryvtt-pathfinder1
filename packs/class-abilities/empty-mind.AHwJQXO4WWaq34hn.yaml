  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, you can clear your mind by focusing on a sense of
      emptiness, purging yourself of doubt and discomfort. You can spend 1 point
      from your phrenic pool on your turn as a free action to remove the
      blinded, confused, dazed, deafened, staggered, or stunned condition from
      yourself.</p>
