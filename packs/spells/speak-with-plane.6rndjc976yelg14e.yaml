  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You tap into the awareness and consciousness of a plane with a sentient
      structure (<i>Planar Adventures</i> 60), allowing it to answer questions.
      A tangible manifestation of the plane (such as the ground) must be within
      the spell's range upon casting.  You can ask the sentient plane one
      question per 2 caster levels. If the plane's alignment is at least one
      step away from yours, the plane can attempt a Will save to resist the
      spell. A plane typically has a +20 bonus on Will saves, and a demiplane
      typically has a +15 bonus on Will saves. A plane's traits can further
      affect these bonuses: a mildly aligned plane receives a +2 bonus, and a
      strongly aligned plane or a plane with the wild magic trait receives a +4
      bonus on its save.  If a plane has been subject to this spell within the
      past week, a new casting of this spell targeting the same plane fails. If
      <i>Speak with Plane</i> targets a plane that does not have a sentient
      structure, the spell fails.</p>
