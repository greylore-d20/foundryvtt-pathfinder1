      "value": "<p>Unlike normal bombs, jury-rigged bombs can be created from whatever materials the alchemist has on hand; this makes them particularly handy in situations where the alchemist might find himself imprisoned or stripped of his equipment. Jury-rigged bombs can be crafted and thrown as a swift action (this counts against the alchemist’s daily use of bombs), and they deal only 1d4 points of damage + additional damage equal to half the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier on a direct hit. This damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Despite being useful in a pinch, jury-rigged bombs are nonetheless crudely crafted and highly unstable; if the alchemist’s attack roll results in a natural 1, the bomb explodes as he is creating it, and he takes damage as if he had taken a direct hit.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
