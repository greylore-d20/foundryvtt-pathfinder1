      <p>You compare two similar items and know if they are identical to one
      another or not. The spell can indicate an identical match, a categorical
      match, or no match. For instance, blood samples are identical if they are
      from the same creature. They are categorical if they are from the same
      species. There is no match if they are from different species, or if one
      sample is merely stage blood.  Alternatively, you can compare dissimilar
      items and know if they have a potential relationship. For instance, you
      can compare a creature's tooth against a bite mark and know if that
      creature could have caused the bite mark.  This spell is not infallible-an
      identical match can result from comparing items or creatures that are
      duplicates of one another. For instance, a knife might have an identical
      match with a stab wound if an identical knife was used to inflict the
      wound, and twins might have identical blood or tissues.</p>
