  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are surrounded by a nimbus of shadow shaped like your god's unholy
      symbol or a symbol of your faith.</p><p>Any good creature striking you
      with unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal
      damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1
      point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons
      with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell
      resistance applies against this damage.</p><p>You also take half damage
      from magical attacks with the good descriptor. If such an attack allows a
      Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving
      throw.</p>
