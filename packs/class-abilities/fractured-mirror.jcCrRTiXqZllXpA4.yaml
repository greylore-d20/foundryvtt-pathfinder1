  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By sending phantom selves across the battlefield, one may fight as
      many. When a ninja with this trick uses the shadow clone ninja trick, she
      gains an additional clone for every 3 ninja levels she has, to a maximum
      of eight clones. In addition, while she has shadow clones deployed, the
      ninja can cause any number of her clones to split from herself as part of
      a move action. The shadow clones move up to the ninja’s speed at her will
      each time she uses a move action to move. Shadow clones separated in this
      way are not considered part of the shadow clone trick until they return to
      the ninja’s square, though they can still be destroyed while separated.
      Shadow clones separated from the ninja have an AC equal to the ninja’s AC
      – 5 and cannot take any actions, though they can provide flanking. Shadow
      clones do not occupy any space and a creature can freely enter a shadow
      clone’s square.</p>

      <p>The ninja must have the shadow clone ninja trick to select this
      trick.</p>
