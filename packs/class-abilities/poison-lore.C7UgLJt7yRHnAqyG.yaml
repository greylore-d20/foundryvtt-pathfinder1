  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An investigator has a deep understanding and appreciation for poisons.
      At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally <em>poison</em> himself when applying
      <em>poison</em> to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute
      physically examining the <em>poison</em>, he can attempt a
      <em>Knowledge</em> (nature) check to identify any natural <em>poison</em>
      or <em>Knowledge</em> (arcana) check to identify any magical
      <em>poison</em> (DC = the <em>poison’s</em> saving throw DC). Lastly, once
      a <em>poison</em> is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a
      <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check (DC = the <em>poison’s</em> saving throw
      DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the <em>poison</em>. Success renders the dose
      harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself
      when examining or attempting to neutralize a <em>poison</em>.</p>
