  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he
      can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monkâ€™s ki
      pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he
      has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as
      magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and
      silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing
      hardness.<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk
      can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when
      making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus
      attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and
      similar effects.</p>

      <p>A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his ki pool as
      he gains levels.<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours
      of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
