  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You imbue a weapon with the power to drive foes back. The first time each
    round the weapon strikes a creature, the weapon attempts a free bull rush
    combat maneuver check against that creature. This does not provoke attacks
    of opportunity. The combat maneuver for the bull rush is equal to 1d20 +
    your caster level. You do not have to move to push creatures more than 5
    feet with this bull rush. If a creature you strike has spell resistance, you
    must attempt a caster level check to overcome its spell resistance the first
    time you strike it. If you fail, that creature is immune to the effects of
    this casting of <i><i>banishing</i> blade</i>.  The first time each
    extraplanar creature whose Hit Dice don't exceed your caster level is driven
    back at least 10 feet by this spell, it must attempt a Will save. If it
    fails, it is sent back to its home plane. Whether it succeeds or fails, that
    creature is staggered for 1 round and <i><i>banishing</i> blade</i>'s
    duration ends.</p>
