    "shortDescription": "<p>You affect the local <i>gravity</i> field in a 30-foot-radius sphere around the spell's designated point of origin. Creatures in the affected area can be weighed down by high <i>gravity</i>, lightened by low <i>gravity</i>, or left to float in an area with no <i>gravity</i>, depending on the effect you choose for your <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>. See page 18 for rules on the effects of high, low, and no <i>gravity</i>.</p><p>Creatures that fall within the area of a <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> spell take more damage from the fall if the <i>gravity</i> within is higher and less damage if the <i>gravity</i> within is lower. However, if the creature falls through a <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> and continues to fall in a non-affected area, the rest of the fall damage is calculated normally. For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a low<i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low <i>gravity</i> plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).</p><p>This spell doesn't counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect <i>gravity</i>; both effects occur simultaneously. For instance, a no-<i>gravity</i> <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> spell cast within the area of a <i>reverse <i>gravity</i></i> spell would simply mean that creatures float about until the <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>'s duration expires or they exit the <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>, at which point they return to the top of the <i>reverse <i>gravity</i></i> effect's area. If both <i>gravity</i>-altering magical effects could not feasibly take place simultaneously (at the GM's discretion), the <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> spell supersedes the previous effect (if it's higherlevel than the previous effect) or simply fails (if it's lower-level).</p>",
