    value: >-
      <p>When you make a d20 roll, you may choose to immediately cast this spell
      to reroll that die before success or failure is known, keeping the more
      favorable result. For the next two rounds following your casting of the
      spell, you must roll two dice each time a d20 roll is called for, keeping
      the less favorable result.</p>
