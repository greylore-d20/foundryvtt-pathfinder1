  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whether through mutation or alchemy, some vigilantes have flesh that is
      as moldable as clay and as fluid as ink. A vigilante with this talent
      gains the <em>shapechanger</em> subtype and the <em>compression</em>
      universal monster rule. In addition, the vigilante can alter his
      appearance as @Compendium[pf1.spells.oj36nfak6jc2s5ky]{Disguise Self},
      except that the changes are physical rather than illusory. However,
      aspects of the vigilanteâ€™s aesthetic persist in all forms, halving the
      bonus on Disguise checks gained from this effect and from seamless
      guise.</p><p>At 12th level, the vigilante can pass through narrow
      openings, even mere cracks, along with any item he wears or carries (to a
      maximum of his light load).</p>
