      <p>This spell summons forth a misty cloud of rust-red toxic algae. Any
      creature within the mist is coated by it, turning the creature the same
      reddish color. All targets within the mist gain concealment. Any creature
      within the mist must save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and become
      enraged, attacking any creatures it detects nearby (as the "attack nearest
      creature" result of the confused condition). An enraged creature remains
      so as long as the spell is in effect. A creature only needs to save once
      each time it is within the mist (though leaving and returning requires
      another save).</p>
