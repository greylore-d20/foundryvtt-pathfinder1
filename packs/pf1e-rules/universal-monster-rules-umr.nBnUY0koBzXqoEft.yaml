These attacks can be primary or secondary attacks. Primary attacks are made using the creature’s full base attack bonus and add the creature’s full Strength bonus to damage rolls. Secondary attacks are made using the creature’s base attack bonus – 5 and add only 1/2 the creature’s Strength bonus to damage rolls. If a creature has only one natural attack, it is always made using the creature’s full base attack bonus and adds 1-1/2 times the creature’s Strength bonus to damage rolls. This increase does not apply if the creature has multiple attacks but takes only one. If a creature has only one type of attack, but has multiple attacks per round, that attack is treated as a primary attack, regardless of its type. Table 3–1 lists some of the most common types of natural attacks and their classifications.</p><p>Some creatures treat one or more of their attacks differently, such as dragons, which always add 1-1/2 times their Strength bonus to damage rolls with their bite attack. These exceptions are noted in the creature’s description.</p><p>Creatures with natural attacks and attacks made with weapons can use both as part of a full attack action (although a creature must forgo one natural attack, be it a claw, slam, or tentacle attack, for each weapon clutched in a limb that would otherwise make a natural attack). Such creatures attack with their weapons normally but treat all of their natural attacks as secondary attacks during that attack, regardless of their type.</p><p>The Damage Type column refers to the sort of damage that the natural attack typically deals: bludgeoning (B), slashing (S), or piercing (P). Some attacks deal damage of more than one type, depending on the creature. In such cases, all the damage is considered to be of all listed types for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>Some fey, humanoids, monstrous humanoids, and outsiders do not have natural attacks. These creatures can make unarmed strikes, but treat them as weapons for the purpose of determining attack bonuses, and they must use the two-weapon fighting rules when making attacks with both hands.</p><p>See Table 3–1 for typical damage values for natural attacks by creature size.</p><h3>Table 3-1: Natural Attacks by Size</h3><table border=\"1\"><thead><tr><th>\_</th><th style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"9\">Base Damage by Size*</th><th colspan=\"2\">\_</th></tr><tr><th>Natural Attack</th><th>Fine</th><th>Diminutive</th><th>Tiny</th><th>Small</th><th>Medium</th><th>Large</th><th>Huge</th><th>Gargantuan</th><th>Colossal</th><th>Damage Type</th><th>Attack Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bite</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>4d6</td><td>B/S/P</td><td>Primary</td></tr><tr><td>Claw</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>B/S</td><td>Primary</td></tr><tr><td>Gore</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>4d6</td><td>P</td><td>Primary</td></tr><tr><td>Hoof, Tentacle, Wing</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>B</td><td>Secondary</td></tr><tr><td>Pincers, Tail Slap</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>4d6</td><td>B</td><td>Secondary</td></tr><tr><td>Slam</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>B</td><td>Primary</td></tr><tr><td>Sting</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>P</td><td>Primary</td></tr><tr><td>Talons</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>S</td><td>Primary</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>—</td><td>1</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d6</td><td>2d8</td><td>B/S/P</td><td>Secondary</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* Individual creatures vary from this value as appropriate.</p><p><em>Format</em>: bite +5 (1d6+1), 2 claws +5 (1d4+2), 4 tentacles +0 (1d4+1)<br><em>Location</em>: Melee and Ranged.</p>"

        pg. 301, Bestiary 2 pg. 298, Bestiary 3 pg. 296, Bestiary 4 pg. 295,
        Bestiary 5 pg. 294</p><p>An incorporeal creature has no physical body.
        It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or
        creatures that strike as magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, or
        supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms.
        Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it takes only half damage from
        a corporeal source. Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can
        affect incorporeal undead. Corporeal spells and effects that do not
        cause damage only have a 50% chance of affecting an incorporeal creature
        (except for channel energy). Force spells and effects, such as from a
        magic missile, affect an incorporeal creature normally.</p><p>An
        incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus, but it has a deflection
        bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if the
        creature’s Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).</p><p>An
        incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must
        remain adjacent to the object’s exterior, and so cannot pass entirely
        through an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the
        presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current
        location, but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an
        incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see beyond
        the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must
        emerge. An incorporeal creature inside an object has total cover, but
        when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a
        creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks.
        An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect.</p><p>An
        incorporeal creature’s attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor,
        armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such
        as mage armor) work normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass
        through and operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal
        creatures can’t fall or take falling damage. They can’t perform trip or
        grapple combat maneuvers, nor can they be tripped or grappled. In fact,
        they can’t take any physical actions that would move or manipulate an
        opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions.
        Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are
        triggered by weight.</p><p>An incorporeal creature moves silently and
        cannot be heard with Perception checks if it doesn’t wish to be. It has
        no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to its melee
        attacks, ranged attacks, and CMB. Nonvisual senses, such as blindsight
        and scent, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard
        to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of
        direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot
        see.</p><p>Format: incorporeal</p><p>Location: Defensive Abilities</p>
