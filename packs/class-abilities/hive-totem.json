      "value": "<p>While raging, the barbarian takes half damage from attacks by swarms of vermin, including spells and effects that act like a swarm of vermin (like @Compendium[pf1.spells.vxi9c3xwa83xthka]{Summon Swarm}&nbsp;used to summon spiders or @Compendium[pf1.spells.jdp0mts5razk0qms]{Insect Plague}). She also gains a +1 bonus on Strength ability checks and to CMD against bull rush, drag, and trip attacks for every four barbarian levels she has (maximum +5). A barbarian must have the animal fury power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</p>"
