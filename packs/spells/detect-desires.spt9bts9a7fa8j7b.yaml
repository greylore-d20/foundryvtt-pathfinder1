      <p>This spell functions as per <i>detect thoughts</i>, except you sense
      significant desires of creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or
      higher, regardless of whether they are conscious or not.  Instead of
      Intelligence, the second round of concentration reveals each mind's
      Charisma score. If the highest Charisma score is 26 or higher (and at
      least 10 points higher than your own Charisma score), you are stunned for
      1 round and the spell ends.  Instead of surface thoughts, the third round
      of concentration reveals the most pressing current desire of any mind in
      the area (Will negates).  Presenting a creature with an opportunity to
      fulfill a significant desire grants you a +2 circumstance bonus (or
      higher, at the GM's discretion) on Diplomacy checks to influence it.</p>
