      <p>This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.gzgg3o1y238crj50]{thought shield I}, but
      the circumstance bonus on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects
      increases to +8. In addition, any creature that tries to read your
      thoughts while this spell lasts must succeed at a Will save or be stunned
      for 1 round. This spell can be undercast.</p>
