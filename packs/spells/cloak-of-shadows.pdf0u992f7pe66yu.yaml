  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You wrap yourself in a protective mantle of semi-real shadow. This
      grants a number of advantages: you gain concealment (20% miss chance), a
      +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks, and DR 5/good. This shroud of
      shadows also protects you from direct  sunlight, negating sunlight
      vulnerability, sunlight powerlessness, and similar effects.  When you are
      in dim light or darkness, the first two benefits increase against foes
      that don't have darkvision or the see in darkness ability (<i>Pathfinder
      RPG Bestiary 2</i> 301). Such creatures suffer a 50% miss chance (though
      you don't gain total concealment) and your competence bonus on Stealth
      checks increases to +10 with respect to such creatures.</p>
