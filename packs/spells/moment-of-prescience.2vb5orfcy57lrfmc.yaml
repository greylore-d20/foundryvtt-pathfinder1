  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell's duration,
    you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus
    equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat
    maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw.
    Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single
    attack (even if flatfooted).</p><p>Activating the effect doesn't take an
    action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must
    choose to use the <i>moment of prescience</i> before you make the roll it is
    to modify.</p><p>Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one
    <i>moment of prescience</i> active on you at the same time.</p>
