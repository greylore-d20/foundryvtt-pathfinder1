  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact
      coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or
      by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom
      steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored,
      insubstantial hooves that make no sound.</p><p>It has what seems to be a
      saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse
      to attack it.</p><p>The mount is AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex)
      and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit
      points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20
      feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can
      bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.</p><p>These
      mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities
      include those of mounts of lower caster levels.</p><p><i>8th Level</i>:
      The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without
      difficulty or decrease in speed.</p><p><i>10th Level</i>: The mount can
      use <i>water walk</i> at will (as the spell, no action required to
      activate this ability).</p><p><i>12th Level</i>: The mount can use <i>air
      walk</i> at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this
      ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the
      ground.</p><p><i>14th Level</i>: The mount can fly at its speed with a
      bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.</p>
