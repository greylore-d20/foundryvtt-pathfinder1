      <p>This fluid is used to preserve corpses, whether for later dissection,
      taxidermy, necromancy, or magic such as raise dead. Embalming fluid is
      technically a poison, and using it makes a corpse unpalatable to most
      animals and vermin, though corpse-eating undead don't mind the taste.
      Treating a corpse with embalming fluid takes 1 hour and a successful DC 25
      Heal check. The embalmed corpse decays at half the normal rate (each day
      dead counts as half a day for the purpose of raise dead).</p>
