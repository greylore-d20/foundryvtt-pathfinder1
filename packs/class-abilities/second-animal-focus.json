As with the companion’s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.<br><br>If the hunter’s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion’s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion’s aspects to herself, not both.</p>"
