    value: >-
      <p>A divine entity has blessed you with a source of eldritch power that
      erodes your fortitude, increasing by 50% the duration of any poison,
      sickened condition, or nauseated condition affecting you. Whenever you
      would gain a mystery spell, you can gain Magical Tail (Advanced Race Guide
      193) as a bonus feat instead. Once this choice has been made, it cannot be
      changed. You cannot replace a bonus spell granted to you by an oracle
      archetype with Magical Tail, even if it replaces a mystery spell.</p>
