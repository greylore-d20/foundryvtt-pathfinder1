In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.</p><p>Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a <i>cure</i> spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.</p><p>Magic traps such as <i>spike stones</i> are hard to detect. A character with trapfinding can use the Perception skill to find <i>spike stones</i>.</p><p>The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 29 for <i>spike stones</i>. <i>Spike stones</i> is a magic trap that can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.</p>"
