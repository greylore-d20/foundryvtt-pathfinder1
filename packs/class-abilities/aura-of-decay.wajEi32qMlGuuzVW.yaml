  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of decay as a standard
      action. Living creatures in this aura (except you) take 1d6 points of
      damage per round as their flesh rots. They also take a cumulative –1
      penalty to Strength each round they remain in the aura. Once outside the
      aura, the penalty fades at the rate of –1 per round, but it begins
      building again if they reenter the aura. Plant creatures take 2d6 points
      of damage per round. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per
      day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Bramble Armor power of the Plant Domain.</p>
