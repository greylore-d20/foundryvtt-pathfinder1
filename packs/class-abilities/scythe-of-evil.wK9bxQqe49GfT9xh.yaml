        <p>An unholy weapon is imbued with unholy power. This power makes the
        weapon evil-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage
        reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures
        of good alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level on any good
        creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as
        the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer
        wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including
        restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, you can give a weapon touched the unholy special weapon
      quality for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level. You can use
      this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for
      every four levels beyond 8th.</p>
