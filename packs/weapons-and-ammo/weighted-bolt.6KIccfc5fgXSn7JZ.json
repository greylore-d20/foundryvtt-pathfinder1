The bolt's extra weight makes the bolt harder to fire accurately, and imposes a -2 penalty on attack rolls.</p>\n<p>In addition to the normal damage dealt by a ballista bolt of its size, on a successful hit the weighted bolt lodges itself into the target's body, leaving the weighted chain hanging loosely, imparting a -5 penalty on all Fly checks made by the target.</p>\n<p>These penalties stack if a target is hit with multiple weighted bolts. A weighted bolt can be removed with a successful DC 25 Heal check or a DC 20 Strength check.</p>"
