    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm
      into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius
      burst as if they were subject to the fear spell. The DC of this effect is
      equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
