      <p><em>You can quickly recuperate from devastating attacks without divine
      assistance.</em></p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Con 13.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>:
      You gain a vigor pool with a maximum number of points equal to your
      Constitution bonus. As a standard action, you can spend up to 1 vigor
      point per 3 Hit Dice you have (minimum 1) to regain 1d6 hit points per
      vigor point spent (maximum 7d6). Each time you spend vigor points, you
      become fatigued for 1 minute. You cannot spend vigor points while fatigued
      or exhausted. Spending vigor points doesnâ€™t provoke attacks of
      opportunity. The points in your vigor pool are replenished to their
      maximum after you rest for 8 hours.</p>
