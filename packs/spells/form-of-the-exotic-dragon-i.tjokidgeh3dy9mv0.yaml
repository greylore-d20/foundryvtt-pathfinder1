      <p>You become a Medium imperial or primal dragon. Druids can choose from
      the primal dragon (brine, cloud, crystal, magma, or umbral) forms only.
      You gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a +2 size bonus to your
      Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 60 feet (poor),
      darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a breath weapon, and either resistance
      to one form of energy or some other bonus. You also gain one bite attack
      (1d8), two claw attacks (1d6), and either a gore attack (1d8) if you
      assume the form of an imperial dragon or two wing attacks (1d4) if you
      assume the form of a primal dragon. Your breath weapon, resistance, and
      any other benefits you gain depend on the type of dragon. You can use the
      breath weapon only once per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal
      6d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to
      halve the normal damage. In addition, some of the dragon types grant
