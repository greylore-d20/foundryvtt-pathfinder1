      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Infused with powerful psychic
      energy, enlightened constructs have access to strange and deadly mental
      powers. Highly intelligent and secretive, these constructs typically serve
      as henchmen to powerful psychics or sorcerous cabals.<p>“Enlightened
      construct” is an acquired template that can be added to any construct,
      referred to hereafter as the base creature. An enlightened construct
      retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as
      noted here.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> If the base creature had 4 or fewer
      HD, base creature’s CR + 1; HD 5–10, base creature’s CR + 2; HD 11 or
      more, base creature’s CR + 3.<p><b>Alignment:</b> An enlightened
      construct’s alignment is no more than one step away from that of its
      creator.<p><b>Type:</b> An enlightened construct gains the augmented
      subtype.<p><b>Senses:</b> An enlightened construct gains lifesense out to
      60 feet.<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> An enlightened construct gains the following
      weakness.<p><em>Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex):</em> An
      enlightened construct is susceptible to mind-affecting effects, even
      though it is a construct. Although they can be magically charmed or
      compelled, enlightened constructs are particularly resistant to
      enchantments and receive a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist these
      effects.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> An enlightened construct gains the
      following special abilities.<p><em>Mind Thrust (Sp):</em> An enlightened
      construct can use <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=mind%20thrust">mind
      thrust</a> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 2 +
      the enlightened construct’s Intelligence modifier. The version of <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=mind%20thrust">mind
      thrust</a> available to an enlightened construct is determined by its Hit
      Dice: HD Spell</p>

      <p><br><b>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):</b> An enlightened construct gains a
      number of spell-like abilities set by its Hit Dice. It gains the
      spell-like abilities listed in the entry for its Hit Dice on the table
      below, as well as all listed spell-like abilities for prior entries.
      Unless otherwise noted, each ability is usable 1/day. The caster level for
      these abilities is equal to the enlightened construct’s Hit Dice (or the
      caster level of the base construct’s spell-like abilities, whichever is
      higher). The DC for a saving throw against the enlightened construct’s
      spell-like ability is equal to 10 + the spell’s level + the enlightened
      construct’s Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p><br><b>Ability Scores:</b> If the base creature had an Intelligence
      score of 9 or less, roll 2d6+4 to determine the enlightened construct’s
      new Intelligence score. If the base creature had an Intelligence score of
      10 or greater, increase its Intelligence score by 6. Additionally,
      increase the enlightened construct’s Charisma score by
      2d6.<p><b>Feats:</b> Since it has an Intelligence score, an enlightened
      construct gains feats as normal for a creature of its Hit
      Dice.<p><b>Skills:</b> An enlightened construct gains skill points
      according to its new Intelligence score, which are assigned appropriately
      for its function, as determined by the GM.<p><b>Languages:</b> An
      enlightened construct speaks one language that its creator spoke, plus a
      number of additional languages that its creator knew equal to the
      enlightened construct’s Intelligence bonus (if any). The enlightened
      construct can also communicate by telepathy up to a range of 100
      feet.<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> An enlightened construct gains the
      following special qualities.<p><em>Artificial Soul (Su):</em> Though not
      the true soul of a living creature, the enlightened construct’s artificial
      soul provides it with a unique personality and a spark of sentience.
      Unlike most constructs, the enlightened construct is not immune to
      necromantic effects. Enlightened constructs are still immune to death
      effects and they cannot be raised or resurrected. Enlightened construct
      golems are still immune to magic as described in their
      entries.<p><em>Phrenic Stone (Su):</em> An enlightened construct has a
      stone infused with supernatural mental energy embedded into its head or
      chest that is the source of its awakened intellect. If an enlightened
      construct is destroyed but this phrenic stone remains intact, it can be
      used to create another enlightened construct, using the same cost as
      augmenting a new enlightened construct (see Construction below). When a
      phrenic stone is used to create a new enlightened construct, the
      personality and memories of the previous enlightened construct are lost. A
      phrenic stone has hardness 10, 20 hit points, and a break DC of 30.</p>
