      <p>This spell functions as <i>symbol of death</i>, except all creatures
      within the radius of a <i>symbol of strife</i> are compelled to attack the
      nearest conscious creaturefor 1 round per caster level (similar to the
      "attack nearest creature" result of the <i>confusion</i> spell), even
      after leaving the symbol's area of effect. If no other creatures are
      visible, an affected creature can act normally. Once triggered, the symbol
      remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Symbol of
      strife</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a
      caster of 18th level or higher for the cost of 25,000 gp.</p>
