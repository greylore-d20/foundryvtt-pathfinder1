    "shortDescription": "<p>The target creature gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that rely on negative emotions (such as <i>crushing despair</i>, <i>rage</i>, or fear effects) or that would force him to harm an ally (such as confusion). If the target is already under such an effect when receiving this spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of this spell. It does not affect mind-affecting effects based on positive emotions (such as <i>good hope</i> or the inspire cou<i>rage</i> bard ability). A creature can still be charmed or otherwise magically controlled while under this spell's effects, but if such a creature ever receives a new saving throw against that effect as a result of being ordered to attempt to harm or otherwise oppose a true ally, he can roll that saving throw twice and take the better result as his actual roll. <i>Calm emotions</i> counters and dispels <i>unbreakable heart</i>.</p>"
