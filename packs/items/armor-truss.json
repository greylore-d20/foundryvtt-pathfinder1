If you take at least 15 minutes preparing an empty suit of armor with an armor truss, you are considered to have help in putting on the armor and can don the armor in the time it usually takes to don the armor hastily without worsening armor check penalties or decreasing armor bonuses.</p>\r\n\r\n"
