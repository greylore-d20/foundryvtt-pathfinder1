      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>A combination weapon, this gun mixes a coat pistol with a sword cane.
      The sword cane pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of
      creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. The pistol
      attachment makes the nature of the weapon a little more difficult to hide.
      An observer must succeed at a DC 15 Perception check to realize that an
      undrawn sword cane pistol is a weapon rather than a simple walking stick;
      the DC decreases to 5 if the observer is able to handle the weapon.</p>

      <p>A sword cane pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or
      a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. The sword part of the weapon
      must be drawn in order to load the pistol part of the weapon.</p>
