  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The Garundi tenaciously protect their homes, and through the years they
      have perfected magic to aid them in their defense.</p><p>An immobile,
      crystalline, weblike globe surrounds you.</p><p>When the <i>ablative
      sphere</i> winks into existence, it provides you with improved cover
      (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 196). The barrier does not impede a
      spell's line of sight or effect.</p><p>The sphere is 1 inch thick per
      caster level, has hardness 5, and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. When
      an <i>ablative sphere</i> loses hit points, the level of cover it provides
      is reduced. When the <i>ablative sphere</i> has lost one-third of its hit
      points, it provides cover instead of improved cover. Once it has lost
      two-thirds of its hit points, it provides only partial cover. Finally,
      when the <i>ablative sphere</i>'s hit points reach 0, the globe is
      destroyed. When an attack reduces an <i>ablative sphere</i>'s hit points
      to 0, you take any remaining damage.</p>
