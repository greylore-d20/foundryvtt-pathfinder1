When she hits with an attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo one or more of her sneak attack dice to reduce the targetâ€™s natural armor bonus by that amount (minimum natural armor bonus of +0) until the end of her next turn. A creature cannot be affected by this ability again for 1 minute.</p>"
