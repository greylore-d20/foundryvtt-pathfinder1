      <p>At 8th level, the cavalierâ€™s mount becomes healthier and more robust.
      It gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.8snLqsJN4LLL00Nq]{Toughness} as a bonus
      feat (if it already has
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.8snLqsJN4LLL00Nq]{Toughness}, or takes this as a
      feat later, the hit points granted by the feat are doubled) and gains a +2
      bonus on saving throws.</p>
