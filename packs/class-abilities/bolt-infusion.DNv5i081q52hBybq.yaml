      blast<br><b>Saving Throw</b> Reflex half</p>

      <p>You unleash a bolt of lightning above an enemy within 30 feet and send
      it spiraling down with tremendous force. Each bolt is a 5-foot-wide,
      30-foot-long, vertical bolt, dealing your full blast damage to creatures
      within the line. If all squares in the boltâ€™s area are outdoors and in a
      storm, the blast deals an additional 1 point of damage per die. The saving
      throw is Dexterity-based.</p>
