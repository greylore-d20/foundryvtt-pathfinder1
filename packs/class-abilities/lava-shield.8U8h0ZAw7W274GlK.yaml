      <p><strong>Source</strong> Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 21</p><p>At 8th
      level, you can create a barrier of lava to protect you for 1 round as a
      standard action. Choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a
      solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover from
      attacks that pass through this edge, and you gain the benefits of fire
      shield (warm shield) while adjacent to the lava shield. You can dismiss
      the lava shield as a free action, and it disappears immediately if you
      leave your space. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day
      equal to half your wizard level.</p>
