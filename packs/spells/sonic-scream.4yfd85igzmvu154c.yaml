  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Up to three times during this spell's duration, you can emit a cone of
    powerful sound as a standard action. The first cone deals 4d4 points of
    sonic damage to every creature in the area. The second deals 2d4 points of
    sonic damage to every creature in the area. The third deals 1d4 points of
    sonic damage to every creature in the area. A successful Reflex save against
    a cone halves that cone's damage. After the third cone of sound, the spell
    ends. Until you use all three cones, you cannot use your voice for any
    magic-related purpose (bardic performance, verbal spellcasting, and so on),
    and cannot speak at any volume lower than a shout.</p>
