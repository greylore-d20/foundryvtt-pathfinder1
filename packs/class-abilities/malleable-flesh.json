      "value": "<p>Whether through mutation or alchemy, some vigilantes have flesh that is as moldable as clay and as fluid as ink. A vigilante with this talent gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterSubtypes.aspx?ItemName=Shapechanger\">shapechanger</a>&nbsp;subtype and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Compression\">compression</a>&nbsp;universal monster rule. In addition, the vigilante can alter his appearance as @Compendium[pf1.spells.oj36nfak6jc2s5ky]{Disguise Self}, except that the changes are physical rather than illusory. However, aspects of the vigilanteâ€™s aesthetic persist in all forms, halving the bonus on Disguise checks gained from this effect and from seamless guise.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, the vigilante can pass through narrow openings, even mere cracks, along with any item he wears or carries (to a maximum of his light load).</p>"
