      <p>There are seven variants of this spell, one for each of the
      Thassilonian schools of magic. Each functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.p8dbns0wei8eayas]{sepia snake sigil} (and
      counts as that spell for the purpose of combining other spells that hide
      or garble text), except instead of trapping the subject, the triggered
      sigil's effect depends on this spell's school. This effect lasts for 1
      day/level. This is a curse effect that can be removed via <em>remove
      curse</em>. <em>Abjuration</em>: All beneficial magical effects on the
      target last half as long as normal. <em>Conjuration</em>: The target is
      nauseated. This is a poison effect. <em>Enchantment</em>: The target takes
      a 1d6 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. This is a compulsion
      effect. <em>Evocation</em>: The target gains vulnerability to an energy
      type, chosen randomly from the following: acid, cold, electricity, or
      fire. This is an acid, cold, electricity, or fire effect.
      <em>Illusion</em>: The target's vision is blurred, giving it a -4 penalty
      on Perception checks relating to vision, and the target treats all other
      creatures as having <em>displacement</em>. This is a glamer effect.
      <em>Necromancy</em>: The target is exhausted. This condition cannot be
      removed with rest. <em>Transmutation</em>: Target is affected by
      <em>slow</em>.</p>
