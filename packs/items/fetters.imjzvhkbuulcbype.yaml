  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Fetters are manacles fitted around the ankles rather than the wrists,
      and use the same rules for breaking, escape, and cost relative to size. A
      creature in fetters is <em>entangled</em> and can only move at half speed.
      In addition, a fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15
      <em>Acrobatics</em> check to move more than its (reduced) speed in a
      round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls
      <em>prone</em>.</p>
