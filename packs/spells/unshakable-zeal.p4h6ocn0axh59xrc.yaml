  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You fill the target with boundless enthusiasm and faith in its ultimate
    triumph. Whenever the target fails an attack roll, a save, a skill check, a
    concentration check, or an ability check, the target receives a +4 morale
    bonus on its next attempt at the failed check within 1 round (this includes
    attack rolls against the same foe, saving throws against the same ability
    from the same foe, and so on). In addition, when the target would be
    affected by a fear or emotion effect, it can instead dismiss <i>unshakable
    zeal</i> without spending an action to negate the effect on itself.</p>
