  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>intellect fortress I</i>, but in addition,
      any mind-affecting effects that deal damage have their damage reduced by
      half (before any reduction due to a successful save or other effect). This
      applies to both hit point damage and ability score damage. This spell can
      be undercast.</p>
