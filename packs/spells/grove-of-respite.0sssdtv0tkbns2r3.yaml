  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You conjure a sheltered grove of trees surrounding a shallow spring. The
    grove appears from nowhere even in the most barren, rocky soil regardless of
    season, but the spell must be cast outside on open ground.</p><p>The area
    within the grove is temperate and comfortable, like that of a <i>tiny
    hut</i>, although the grove provides no illumination and provides no
    protection from the elements. The water in the grove's spring is clean and
    drinkable. Additionally, the trees provide a variety of ripe fruit,
    regardless of season, which acts as a <i>goodberry</i> spell for up to eight
    people. The grove is warded with an <i>alarm</i> spell that alerts you
    whenever any creature enters the area. Once the spell expires, the grove
    vanishes, including all fruit, water, and other materials from it, although
    any nourishment or healing gained from its effects remains.</p>
