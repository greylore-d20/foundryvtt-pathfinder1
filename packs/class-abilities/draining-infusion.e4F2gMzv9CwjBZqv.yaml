      <p>You can drain elemental energy and matter from your foes to strengthen
      your next attack. When you use this infusion, your kinetic blast affects
      only creatures with a subtype matching your kinetic blast’s element (for
      instance, a fire blast would damage only creatures of the fire subtype).
      Against such creatures, your blast targets touch AC (if it requires an
      attack roll) and always allows spell resistance. Because you are draining
      energy from the target, your blast doesn’t apply your elemental overflow
      bonuses or Constitution modifier. The target can attempt a Fortitude save
      to take 1/4 the normal amount of damage.</p>

      <p>Draining infusion ignores any damage reduction, resistances, and
      immunities the creature might possess. If at least one creature fails its
      saving throw against your draining infusion, you can reduce the total burn
      cost of any one blast wild talent used before the end of your next turn by
      1, or by 2 if you have the supercharge ability. If you use draining
      infusion again before applying this reduction, you still deal the damage
      from that draining infusion, but the burn reductions don’t stack.</p>
