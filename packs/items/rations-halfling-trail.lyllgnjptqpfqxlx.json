      "value": "<h4>Rations, Halfling Trail</h4>\n<p><b>Price</b> 1 sp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>\n<p>A day's worth of halfling trail rations is actually more than what a typical adventuring halfling eats in a day-a full belly strengthens a halfling's resolve. Common foods include sweetened dried fruit, aged sausage, hard sharp cheese, honey cakes, and a mixture of roasted grains, nuts, and molasses. If you are a halfling who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you reduce the penalty for the shaken condition from -2 to -1. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day's worth.</p>"
