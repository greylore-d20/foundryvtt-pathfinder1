  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can use her cauldron to brew a foul toxin in which she can
      steep fruits and other delicious edibles, transforming them so that when
      eaten, they have the same effect as a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.vdh0yuzpjwhky6kr]{Poison} spell. Brewing the toxin
      and then steeping the food takes 1 hour in total; steeping can affect up
      to 1 pound of food. The food is poisoned for 24 hours, and the poison
      cannot be transferred to other objects. The food tastes normal, but magic
      detects it as poisonous.</p><p>The witch must have the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.ieI7su1zQYRe2KzG]{cauldron hex} to
      select this hex.</p>
