    value: >-
      <p>You suffer from minor ailments and sicknesses. While you struggle to
      resist new diseases, you have grown accustomed to the many inconveniences
      of sickness. You take a â€“1 penalty on all saving throws against disease or
      infestation effects, but you are immune to the sickened condition.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.y7aqxf7alib6ld6t]{Pox
      Pustules} to your list of 2nd-level oracle spells known.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, increase the save DC of any disease effect you create by
      +2, and you raise the number of saves required to recover naturally from
      these diseases by 1.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, you are immune to the effects of disease and
      infestations, but you can still function as a carrier for sickness.</p>
