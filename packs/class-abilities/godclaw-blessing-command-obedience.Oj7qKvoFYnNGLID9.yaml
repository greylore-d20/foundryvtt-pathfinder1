      <p>You can touch an ally and say a quick word to remind her of her
      obligations, granting her a new saving throw against each enchantment
      effect that currently affects her. If the saving throw is successful, the
      enchantment effect immediately ends. This power affects only effects that
      allow a saving throw.</p>
