The kit includes such things as false pustules, pills that cause the person chewing them to foam at the mouth, and herbal concoctions designed to induce fevers or vomiting. Using a symptom kit grants you a +5 circumstances bonus on <em>Disguise</em> checks made for the purpose of simulating illness. A symptom kit is exhausted after 10 uses.</p>"
