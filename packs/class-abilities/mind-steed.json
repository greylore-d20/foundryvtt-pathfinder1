The horse lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>If you are at least 5th level, the mount’s base land speed increases by 20 feet. If you are at least 9th level and you expend 1 additional point of mental focus, the mount can fly at a speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability, but doing so reduces the mount’s duration to 1 minute per occultist level you possess.</p>"
