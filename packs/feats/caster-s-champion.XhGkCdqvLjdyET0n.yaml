    value: >-
      <p><em>You draw upon the power of an allied arcane spellcaster to enhance
      your weapons with magical energy.</em></p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Three times
      per day as a swift action, when you are within 30 feet of an ally who is
      an arcane spellcaster, you can channel a portion of her arcane power into
      your weapons. For 1 round, you gain a +1 bonus on all weapon damage rolls,
      and your weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction. When your base attack bonus reaches +4 and every 4 points
      thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 16th
      level.</p><p><b>Special</b>: This feat counts as Arcane Strike for the
      purposes of prerequisites.</p>
