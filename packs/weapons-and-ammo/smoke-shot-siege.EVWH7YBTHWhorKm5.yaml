    value: >-
      <p>This hard ceramic sphere contains two alchemical substances separated
      by a thin barrier, much like a smoke pellet in larger form, usable by
      cannons and fiend's mouth cannons.</p>

      <p>When it hits the targeting space, it deals <b>2d6 points of damage</b>
      to any creature in that space, and the substances mingle and then create
      an area of foul but harmless yellow smoke radiating 30 feet from the
      target square.</p>

      <p>Treat the effect as a @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog
      Cloud} spell.</p>

      <h3>Mishap</h3>

      <p>On a siege engine mishap, the ammunition explodes before it is
      launched. Its effect is centered on one of the spaces of the siege engine
      (crew leader's choice).</p>
