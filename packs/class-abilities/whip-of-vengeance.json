If he already has the Whip Mastery feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat he qualified for at the level when he chose Whip Mastery.</p>\n<p>In addition, if he is at least 6th level, he also gains the Improved Whip Mastery feat. He treats his vigilante level as his vigilante base attack bonus for the purpose of meeting prerequisites of feats and abilities that have Whip Mastery as a prerequisite.</p>"
