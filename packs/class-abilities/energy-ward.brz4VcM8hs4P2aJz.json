When you activate this power, you must select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain resistance 10 against that energy type, and whenever a creature hits you with a melee weapon or natural weapon, that creature takes 1d6 points of energy damage of the chosen type. Attacks made with melee weapons with reach donâ€™t cause the attacker to take this damage.</p>\n<p>At 13th and 19th levels, the resistance granted by this ward increases by 5, to a maximum of resistance 20 at 19th level.</p>\n<p>The energy ward lasts for 1 round per occultist level.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>"
