      "value": "<p>An eidolon appears as an undead creature, and mimics some of an undead creature's abilities and weaknesses. Negative energy heals the eidolon, and positive energy (including a cleric's channel energy ability) harms it. Spells and effects that target undead or have specific effects against undead (such as Command Undead,&nbsp;hold undead, and&nbsp;searing light) affect the eidolon as if it were undead. The eidolon gains a +2 bonus on saves against disease, exhaustion, fatigue, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.<br><br>At 7th level, this bonus on saves can be increased to +4 by spending 2 additional evolution points.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, this protection can be increased to immunity against these attacks by spending 2 additional evolution points (the summoner must pay for the 7th-level upgrade before paying for this 12th-level upgrade).<br><br>Although the eidolon appears undead, it is still an outsider.</p>"
