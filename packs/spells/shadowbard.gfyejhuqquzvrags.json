    "shortDescription": "<p>You conjure up a quasi-real phantom singer that is visible as a shifting, shadowy duplicate of yourself. The singer follows you automatically, moving as you move even if you teleport.</p><p>The singer cannot be damaged, but can be dispelled. When a <i>shadowbard</i> comes into being, it immediately begins a bardic performance of your choice-it has access to all of the bardic performances that you do. It continues that bardic performance until you direct it as a move action to switch to a different performance. Rounds spent by a <i>shadowbard</i> creating a bardic performance do not decrease the number of rounds you can use your own bardic performance, nor can a <i>shadowbard</i>'s bardic performance be used to trigger spells that require you to begin or cease a bardic performance.</p>"
