  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This pike has a hollow spot near its tip into which a flask can be
      strapped. If the flask is filled with an alchemical splash weapon and you
      hit a creature with the pike, the target is also hit with the splash
      weapon. This uses up the contents of the flask. Because of the added
      weight of a flask, attacks with the flask pike take a -2 penalty when it's
      loaded with one. Reloading the flask pike is a full-round action that
      provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
