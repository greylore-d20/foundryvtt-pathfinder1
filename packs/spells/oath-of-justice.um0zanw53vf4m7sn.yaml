  shortDescription: >-
    <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> In order to prepare this spell, the caster must
    spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches <b>Kols</b>. Further
    details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of
    Golarion.</em></p><p>This spell seals a solemn vow between two creatures.
    When this spell is cast, the targets must clasp hands and swear their oath
    in Kols's name. The spell functions like
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.3jaumkutti1ytulq]{mark of justice}, except as noted
    above and rather than being cursed, the oath-breaker gains a mark on the
    face indicating to all dwarves who see it that the target has broken a
    sacred oath, which gives the oath-breaker a -4 penalty to influence dwarves.
    The mark can be removed as described in the <em>mark of justice</em> spell,
    or the other target can forgive the oath-breaker, which causes the mark to
    vanish.</p>
