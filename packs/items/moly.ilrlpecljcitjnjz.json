Moly remains fresh in this way for only 12 hours, regardless of magical attempts to preserve it. When processed into a powder with a successful DC 25 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check, moly can be sprinkled on a creature, object, or area (a <em>standard action</em>) to end a spell as if with <em>dispel magic</em> (<em>caster level</em> 6th).</p>"
