Furthermore, if she makes a sneak attack during the surprise round using a concealed weapon that her opponent didnâ€™t know about, she does not have to roll sneak attack damage, and the sneak attack deals maximum damage. A rogue can only use the underhanded talent a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0).</p>"
