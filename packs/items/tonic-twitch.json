If you drink twitch tonic, you gain a +2 <em>alchemical bonus</em> on saving throws made against these effects for the next hour. If you drink twitch tonic while suffering from any of these effects, you may immediately roll another saving throw against the effect (with the +2 bonus); you may gain this particular benefit only once per day. You can administer twitch tonic to an <em>unconscious</em> or <em>paralyzed</em> creature as a <em>full-round action</em>, similar to administering a <em>potion</em>.</p>"
