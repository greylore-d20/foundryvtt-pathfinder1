      <p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make
      the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood,
      commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still
      others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might
      of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of
      magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims.
      Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic
      can resist their control.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Arcanists are scholars of all things magical. They
      constantly seek out new forms of magic to discover how they work, and in
      many cases, to collect the energy of such magic for their own uses. Many
      arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the potency of magic
      than the ramifications of unleashing such power.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d6.</p>
