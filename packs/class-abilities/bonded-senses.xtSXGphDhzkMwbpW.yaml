  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, as a standard action, a spiritualist can share the senses
      of her manifested phantom, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling
      everything her phantom does.</p>

      <p>She can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her
      spiritualist level, but those rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>

      <p>There is no maximum range for this effect, but the phantom and the
      spiritualist must be on the same plane. The spiritualist can end this
      effect as a free action.</p>
