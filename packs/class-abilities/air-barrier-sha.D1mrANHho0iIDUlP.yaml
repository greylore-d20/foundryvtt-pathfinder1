  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman creates an invisible shell of air that grants her a +4 armor
      bonus to AC. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus
      increases by 2. At 13th level, this barrier causes incoming arrows, rays,
      and other ranged attacks requiring an attack roll against her to suffer a
      50% miss chance. The shaman can use this barrier for 1 hour per shaman
      level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent
      in 1-hour increments.</p>
