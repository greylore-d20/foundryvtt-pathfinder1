      or drink to survive. Instead, they absorb the essence of food and drink;
      this consumes the nutrients of the meal as though it had been eaten,
      rendering the food useless to others. Astomoi consume <em>potions</em> and
      other ingested materials in the same fashion. Since they never actually
      ingest anything, they can't normally be exposed to ingested
      poisons.</li></ul>
