  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell
      you are about to cast without increasing the casting time. You must still
      expend a higher-level spell slot to cast this spell. You can use this
      ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for
      every four sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per
      day at 19th level. At 20th level, this ability is replaced by arcane
      apotheosis.</p>
