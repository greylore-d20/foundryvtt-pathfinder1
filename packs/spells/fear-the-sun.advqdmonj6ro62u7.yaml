  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Each target that fails its saving throw gains light blindness, as per the
    universal monster rule. When exposed to bright light, affected targets are
    blinded for 1 full round and are dazzled in successive  rounds. If you cast
    this spell in the presence of bright light, any target that fails its save
    is blinded immediately, and dazzled starting at the beginning of its first
    turn.</p>
