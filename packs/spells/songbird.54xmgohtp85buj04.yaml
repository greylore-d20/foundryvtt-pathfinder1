    value: >-
      <p>You conjure uplifting music from the wilds of Elysium, Heaven, or
      Nirvana to bolster other musical activities.  If you cast <i>songbird</i>
      during the same round in which you attempt a Perform check,
      <i>songbird</i> acts as accompaniment and grants a +3 bonus on that
      Perform check.  If you cast <i>songbird</i> in the same round in which you
      activate a bardic performance, that round of bardic performance does not
      count against your total rounds of bardic performance available for the
      day.  If you cast <i>songbird</i> in the same round in which you cast a
      spell with the sonic descriptor, that spell's save DC increases by 1.</p>
