  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This round, rainbow-hued glass flask allows up to three alchemical
      <em>splash weapons</em> of the same type to be poured into it,
      concentrating them such that they never increase its weight noticeably. If
      multiple types of alchemical items are poured in, all the contents are
      ruined. The flask can be thrown as a normal <em>splash weapon</em>, and
      when it breaks, it releases all of the contained <em>splash weapons</em>
      in the same space, and the <em>focusing flask</em> is destroyed. If the
      items held within the flask normally allow a saving throw to reduce or
      negate the effects, the target of a <em>focusing flask</em> needs to
      succeed at only a single saving throw, regardless of the number of items
      held within the <em>focusing flask</em>. The DC of the saving throw
      increases by 2 if the flask contains two alchemical items, or by 4 if it
      contains three items.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Feats</strong>
