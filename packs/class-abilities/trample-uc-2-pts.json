      "value": "<p><b>Requirements:</b> Biped or quadruped base form.</p>\n<p>The eidolon gains the ability to crush its foes underfoot, gaining the trample ability. As a full-round action, the eidolon can overrun any creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself. This works like the overrun combat maneuver, but the eidolon does not need to attempt a check; it merely has to move over opponents in its path. The creatures take 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge), plus 1-1/2 times the eidolon’s Strength modif ier. Targets of the trample can make attacks of opportunity at a –4 penalty. If a target forgoes this attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s Hit Dice + the eidolon’s Strength modifier.</p>\n<p>A trampling eidolon can deal trampling damage to a specific creature only once per round.</p>"
