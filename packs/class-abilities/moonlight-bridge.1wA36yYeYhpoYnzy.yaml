  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a bridge of shimmering moonlight. The 10-foot-wide span
      touches the ground at a point adjacent to your position. From this point
      it can extend in any direction for 10 feet per oracle level. The path
      persists until you have crossed over the bridge or for 24 hours, whichever
      is shorter.</p>

      <p>You may summon a moonlight bridge a number of times per day equal to
      your Charisma bonus. Should the bridge be attacked, treat it as a wall of
      force.</p>
