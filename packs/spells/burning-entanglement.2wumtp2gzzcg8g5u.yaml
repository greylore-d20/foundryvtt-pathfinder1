      <p>This spell functions as per <i>entangle</i>, except it sets the foliage
      on fire. A creature that begins its turn <i>entangle</i>d by the spell
      takes 4d6 points of fire damage (Reflex half), and a creature that begins
      its turn in the area but is not <i>entangle</i>d takes 2d6 points of fire
      damage (Reflex negates). Smoke rising from the vines partially obscures
      visibility. Creatures can see things in the smoke within 5 feet clearly,
      but attacks against anything farther away in the smoke must contend with
      concealment (20% miss chance). When the spell's duration expires, the
      vines burn away entirely.</p>
