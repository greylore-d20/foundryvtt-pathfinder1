You no longer feel the need to eat and are immune to hunger (though you are still able to consume flesh if you choose to). You gain <em>immunity</em> to cold, <em>nonlethal damage</em>, <em>paralysis</em>, and <em>sleep</em>. You also gain <em>DR</em> 5/â€”. Additionally, you gain the <em>stench</em> ability with a radius of 10 feet. Creatures that fail their <em>Fortitude</em> saving throws are <em>sickened</em> for 1d6+4 minutes. Use half your <em>sorcerer</em> level instead of half your racial <em>Hit Dice</em> to determine the saving throw DC.</p>"
