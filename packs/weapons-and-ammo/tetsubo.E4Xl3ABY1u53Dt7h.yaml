  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A slight improvement over the greatclub, this weapon consists of a
      long, slender length of wood or metal whose upper half is shod with a
      thick sheet of studded iron. The iron gives added weight and strength to
      the club, while the studs are designed to crack helmets and armor.</p>
