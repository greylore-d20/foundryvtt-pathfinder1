    value: >-
      <p>You select one enemy and one willing ally as targets. The enemy gains a
      new Will saving throw at the beginning of each turn, and on a successful
      saving throw the spell ends. Both targets remain visible and audible, and
      can see and hear other creatures, but cannot physically interact with any
      creature save one another. Spells or weapon attacks from the affected
      creatures impact only each other, though spells might affect terrain or
      other factors not related to other creatures. If one of the creatures
      becomes unconscious or dies, or if the effect is dispelled, the effect
      ends for both of them.</p>
