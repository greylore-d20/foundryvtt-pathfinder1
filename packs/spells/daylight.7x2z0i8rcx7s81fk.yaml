  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to
      shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the
      light level for an additional 60 feet by one step (<i>darkness</i> becomes
      dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright
      light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while
      within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this
      spell is not the equivalent of <i>daylight</i> for the purposes of
      creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light.</p><p>If
      <i>daylight</i> is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or
      under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the
      covering is removed.</p><p><i>Daylight</i> brought into an area of magical
      <i>darkness</i> (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the
      otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of
      effect.</p><p><i>Daylight</i> counters or dispels any <i>darkness</i>
      spell of equal or lower level, such as <i>darkness</i>.</p>
