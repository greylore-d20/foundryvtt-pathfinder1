  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You test a creature's purity of convictions by exposing it to a sheet of
    divine fire. Unless the target's alignment is within one step of your
    deity's, the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum
    5d6 points of damage). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half
    results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being
    reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. Additionally, if the target has
    an element of its alignment that is in direct opposition to your (chaos
    opposes law and evil opposes good), you can also attempt an Intimidate check
    to demoralize the target as a free action.</p>
