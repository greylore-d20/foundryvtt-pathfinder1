      "value": "<p>The spirit of the city shrouds one creature the shaman touches from the hazards of the slums. The warded creature gains a +5 bonus on saves against disease and poison, and a +25% bonus on percentage chances to negate critical hits and sneak attacks. (This stacks with effects such as&nbsp;fortification, or abilities that grant a creature with no chance to negate critical hits a flat 25% chance.) Each time the ward is used (whether the roll is successful or not), the bonuses are reduced by 1 and 5%, respectively. The ward ends when the bonuses are reduced to 0, when the shaman wards a new creature, or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. At 8th level and 16th level, the wardâ€™s starting bonuses increase by 2 and 10%, respectively.</p>\n<p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>"
