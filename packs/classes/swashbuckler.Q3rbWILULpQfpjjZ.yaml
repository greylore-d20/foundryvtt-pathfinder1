      <p>Whereas many warriors brave battle encased in suits of armor and
      wielding large and powerful weapons, swashbucklers rely on speed, agility,
      and panache. Swashbucklers dart in and out of the fray, wearing down
      opponents with lunges and feints, all while foiling the powerful attacks
      against them with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade. Their
      deft parries and fatal ripostes are carnage elevated to an art form. Some
      may be arrogant and devil-may-care, but behind this veneer lie people
      deeply dedicated to their craft. Those of smaller races are particularly
      driven to prove that the right mix of discipline and daring is the perfect
      counter to size and strength, and enjoy nothing more than taking down
      lumbering brutes and bullies.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Combining fancy footwork with quick and precise lunges,
      swashbucklers dart in and out of battle, harassing and thwarting their
      opponents. These fast and agile combatants serve as protectors for
      spellcasters and flank mates for rogues and slayers, while waiting for the
      opportunity to show panache and score the killing blow on some lumbering
      hulk. Swashbucklers often face death with wry humor, mocking it with
      jabbing wit.</p>
