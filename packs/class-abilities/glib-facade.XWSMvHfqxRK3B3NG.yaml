      <p>Once per day, a character with this advanced talent can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.7c8nufdm0pj4bgep]{Glibness} as a spelllike ability,
      using her rogue level as the spellâ€™s caster level. A character must have
      the innocent facade rogue talent before selecting this talent.</p>
