    value: >-
      <p>The monk attempts to sweep his foeâ€™s leg, knocking the opponent down.
      If the attack hits, the monk can make a free trip attempt against the
      target of this strike (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to
      hit the foe). This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity.</p>

      <p>The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.</p>
