    "shortDescription": "<p>You create one or more vibrant pillars of kaleidoscopic color that rise out from the ground. A creature attempting to move through one of the pillars must attempt a Will save. Failure means the creature can't move through the pillar and can't take any other actions for the duration of its turn that round, but it can attempt to pass through the pillar again in subsequent rounds (attempting another save against the effect). A creature need only succeed at one saving throw to move through all pillars created by this spell.  A creature standing within the area of a pillar is dazzled (no save), while a creature making a ranged attack that passes through one or more of the illusory pillars takes a 50% miss chance. A creature can make a melee attack against a target within a pillar at no penalty.</p>",
