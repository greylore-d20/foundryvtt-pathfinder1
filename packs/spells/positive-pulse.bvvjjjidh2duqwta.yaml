      <p>This spell causes a wave of positive energy to spread from a point you
      designate, damaging foes vulnerable to positive energy and bolstering
      living creatures. Each creature damaged by positive energy in the area
      (such as undead) must succeed at a Will save or take 1d6 points of damage,
      plus 1 point for every 2 caster levels (maximum +5). Haunts manifesting in
      the spell's area also take this damage.  This spell does not heal
      creatures healed by positive energy; such creatures instead gain a +2
      bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, negative
      energy, and effects directly caused by haunts. This bonus lasts for 1
      round.</p>
