  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You grant the target the ability to pick up on the subtle scents and
    disturbances to the natural order that are specific to the living dead,
    granting the target the ability to sense the presence of undead creatures.
    The target is constantly aware of whether there are any undead auras within
    60 feet of her in any direction. If at least one undead aura is present, the
    target can concentrate on the spellâ€™s effects in order to gain more
    information on the auras present. This functions similarly to
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.aa0w7tk852iqn3ni]{detect undead}, except the number
    of rounds of concentration needed to learn about the undead auras is reduced
    by 1 (1 round to learn the number of auras, and 2 rounds to learn the
    strength and location of each aura).</p>
