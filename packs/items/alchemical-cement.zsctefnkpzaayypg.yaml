    value: >-
      <p>You mix this fine gray powder with water and a cubic foot of sand or
      gravel to form a durable stone-like material. Until it cures, it has the
      consistency of thick mud, and you must hold it in place (typically with a
      frame of earth or wood) if you want it to harden in a specific shape. It
      takes 1d10+10 minutes for the cement to partially cure, gaining hardness 2
      and 5 hit points per inch of thickness. After 1d6 hours the cement is
      fully cured and as hard as true
      stone.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC
