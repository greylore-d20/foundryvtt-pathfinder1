  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.t44p3oeq43jwcgwg]{Greater Polymorph}<em>,</em> except
    that it changes one object or creature into another. You can use this spell
    to transform all manner of objects and creatures into new forms-you aren't
    limited to transforming a living creature into another living form. The
    duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the
    original state to its transmuted state. The duration is determined by using
    the following guidelines.</p>

    <p>If the target of the spell does not have physical ability scores
    (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), this spell grants a base score of 10
    to each missing ability score. If the target of the spell does not have
    mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), this spell grants
    a score of 5 to such scores. Damage taken by the new form can result in the
    injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when
    the new form is changed through physical force. A nonmagical object cannot
    be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren't affected by
    this spell.</p>

    <p>This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as
    copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also
    cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome
    the damage reduction of certain creatures.</p>

    <p>This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of baleful
    polymorph, <em>greater polymorph,</em> flesh to stone, stone to flesh,
    transmute mud to rock, transmute metal to wood, or transmute rock to
    mud.</p>
