  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you can emit a 15-foot-radius haze of daydreams for a
      number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not
      need to be consecutive. Creatures within the haze gain the fascinated
      condition unless they succeed at a Will save (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your
      cleric level + your Wisdom modifier). You may designate a number of
      creatures equal to your cleric level that are not affected by the haze.
      The fascinated condition ends immediately when the creatures leave the
      area or the aura expires.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Good Fortune power of the Luck Domain.</p>
