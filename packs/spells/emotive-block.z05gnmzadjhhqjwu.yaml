      <p>You create an emotional block in the target's mind, adding an emotion
      component to each spell or spell-like ability he uses. This is in addition
      to any other components the spell already requires, and doesn't replace
      the somatic component. The target's spell-like abilities require this
      emotion component, even though they normally don't need spell components. 
      As usual with emotion components, the target can't cast spells (or use
      spell-like abilities, in this case) while affected by a non-harmless
      emotion or fear effect.</p>
