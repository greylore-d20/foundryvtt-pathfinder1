      "value": "<p>A penetrating charge is a bomb specifically designed to disable locks and similar mechanisms, though not other means of sealing a door, a container, or other sorts of devices. As a full-round action, the alchemist can place a penetrating charge on a lock. Instead of dealing damage, the penetrating charge seeps into the mechanism and eats away at it, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on any subsequent Disable Device checks against the mechanism. A creature can spend 10 minutes and attempt an appropriate Craft check (DC 15) to fix the lock and remove this bonus.</p>"
