  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters,
      and can use his own magic to duplicate those classesâ€™ spells. Once per
      day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard
      spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald
      spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a
      spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full
      round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.<p>At 11th level, a
      skald can use this ability twice per day.</p>

      <p>At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p>
