You take a –2 penalty on all other skill checks for the following minute as the spirit interferes with your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>. At 13th level, you can reroll any other skill check, but the penalty for using the ability in this way increases to –4 for the following 10 minutes. You must reroll the check before you learn the result of your original check, and cannot use this power while the skill check penalty associated with inside agent is imposed on you.</p>"
