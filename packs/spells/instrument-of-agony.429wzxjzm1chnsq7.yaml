    value: >-
      <p>You cause a weapon to exude a palpable aura of divine fury. While
      wielding this weapon, a creature gains a +2 morale bonus on Intimidate
      checks. When an attack made using the targeted weapon hits, the wielder
      can spend a free action to discharge the effect to inflict agony on the
      creature the weapon hit. If that creature has spell resistance, it applies
      against this effect. If the creature fails a Will save, it is nauseated
      for 1d4+1 rounds. If it succeeds at the saving throw, the creature is
      instead sickened for 1 round. The sickened condition created by the
      instrument is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
