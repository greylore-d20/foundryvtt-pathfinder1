      <p>Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze in some regions to sustain
      themselves, but feed provides more reliable nourishment. Riding dogs and
      other carnivores can be fed meat for the same cost. Except for horses,
      other Large creatures need to eat twice the feed of other animals each
      day. Huge creatures need four times the feed.</p>
