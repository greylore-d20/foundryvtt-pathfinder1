      <p>Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for
      practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform
      simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe
      limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It
      can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill,
      warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or
      affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create
      small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created
      by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used
      as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, prestidigitation lacks
      the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an
      object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1
      hour.</p>
