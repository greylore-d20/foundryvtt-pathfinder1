      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 20 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>\r\n<p>This glue is stored as two flasks of syrupy liquid. When mixed together and allowed to cure, they form a strong bond. The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste, spills, and inaccurate mixing) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. The glue is tacky after 1 minute and fully cured after 1 hour. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 20 <em>Strength</em> check for tacky glue or DC 25 for cured glue. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) is a DC 15 <em>Strength</em> check for tacky glue or DC 20 for cured glue.</p>\r\n"
