  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell slows the metabolism and other bodily functions of a
      creature for a short amount of time. The target is staggered and moves at
      half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), but it
      can hold its breath for twice as long as normal.</p>
