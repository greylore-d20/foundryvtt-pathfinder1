      <p>This spell functions as <i>Seeds of Influence</i>, except that if the
      target is protected by a spell that grants immunity, spell resistance, or
      a saving throw bonus against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast
      on the target, you can attempt caster level checks to dispel each such
      effect before applying the effects of those protections against the spell.
      The DC of the caster level check to dispel each effect is equal to 11 +
      the effect's caster level. Such spells cast on the target while greater
      <i>Seeds of Influence</i> is active grant no protection against greater
      <i>Seeds of Influence</i>.</p>
