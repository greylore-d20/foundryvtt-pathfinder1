  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a ranged touch attack, you can unleash a ray that causes a target to
      gain one negative level. The ray has a range of 30 feet. This negative
      level lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier.
      Whenever this ability gives a target a negative level, you heal a number
      of hit points equal to your oracle level. You can use this ability once
      per day, plus one additional time at 11th level and every four levels
      thereafter.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
