      "value": "<p>The alchemist chooses an element (air, earth, fire, or water). Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains resistance 5 to the associated energy type and a +2 competence bonus on an associated skill check. This resistance increases by 5 and the competence bonus by 2 for each of the following discoveries the alchemist possesses: grand mutagen, greater mutagen, and true mutagen.<br><br>The elements and their associated energies and skills are air (electricity, Fly), earth (acid, Climb), fire (fire, Acrobatics), and water (cold, Swim). An alchemist can select this discovery up to four times, but must choose a different element each time. An alchemist can gain the benefits of only one elemental mutagen at a time, selected when he imbibes the mutagen.</p>"
