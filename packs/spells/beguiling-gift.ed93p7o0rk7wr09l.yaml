      <p>You offer an object to an adjacent creature, and entice it into using
      or consuming the proffered item. If the target fails its Will save, it
      immediately takes the offered object, dropping an already held object if
      necessary. On its next turn, it consumes or dons the object, as
      appropriate for the item in question. For example, an apple would be
      eaten, a potion consumed, a ring put on a finger, and a sword wielded in a
      free hand. If the target is physically unable to accept the object, the
      spell fails. The subject is under no obligation to continue consuming or
      using the item once the spell's duration has expired, although it may find
      a cursed item difficult to be rid of.</p>
