      <p>A favored blessing of halfling clerics, this spell grants its target a
      +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If the target has
      the fearless racial trait, it is immune to fear instead. If the target
      fails a saving throw against fear, it can end the spell as an immediate
      action to reroll the save with a +4 morale bonus, and must take the new
      result, even if it is worse.</p>
