  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A 4-foot-long, blazing, forked bolt of electricity springs forth from
    your hand. You wield this spear-like bolt as if it were a trident (you are
    considered proficient with the bolt). Attacks with Gozreh's trident are
    melee touch attacks. The bolt deals 1d8 points of electricity damage + 1
    point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). Since the bolt is immaterial, your
    Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. The bolt can ignite
    combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.</p>
