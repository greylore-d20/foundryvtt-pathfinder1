    "shortDescription": "<p>The <i>black spot</i> is a specific and feared pirate curse. An intangible, illusory <i>black spot</i> manifests above the target's head and remains until the target dies or the curse is lifted. The <i>black spot</i> cannot be covered or hidden by any means, including other illusions.</p><p>The <i>black spot</i> radiates a cursed aura in a 10-foot radius around its target. Anyone within the aura gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. In addition, the target has a -4 penalty on saving throws against death effects.</p><p>Every day in which a creature bears a <i>black spot</i>, it must make a Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage. The damage cannot be healed until the <i>black spot</i> is removed. If the creature's Constitution reaches 0, it dies. Pirates killed by this spell often return as ghosts, but that is not a direct effect of this spell.</p><p>The <i>black spot</i> cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish</i>.</p>"
