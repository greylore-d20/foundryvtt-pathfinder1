    "shortDescription": "<p>You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one.</p><p>Objects changed by a <i>shrink item</i> spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.</p><p><i>Shrink item</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.</p>",
