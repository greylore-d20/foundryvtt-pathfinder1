      "value": "<p>At 13th level, you can mentally construct an extraplanar retreat on the Astral Plane. This ability functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.r4znakt4ukpebsxg]{Create Demiplane, Lesser} with a caster level equal to your psychic level, with the following adjustments: you need no focus to create the fortress of sorrow; the demiplane is permanent until dismissed by you; you cannot create more than one demiplane with this ability or add to the planeâ€™s area by casting the spell again; the light level on the demiplane is dim, though light sources affect it normally; and you cannot bring other creatures to your demiplane.</p>\n<p>Once per day, you can enter your demiplane (as @Compendium[pf1.spells.q3st18udsalnyz5v]{Plane Shift}), and once per day, you can return in a similar manner, arriving at the same spot you left from (or the nearest available space).</p>"
