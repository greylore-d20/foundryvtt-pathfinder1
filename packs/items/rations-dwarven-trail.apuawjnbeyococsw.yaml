      <h4>Rations, Dwarven Trail</h4>

      <p><b>Price</b> 2 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1-1/2 lbs.</p>

      <p>Dwarven trail rations consist of smoked sausages and salted meat,
      rounded out with hard biscuits and dried vegetables. If you are a dwarf
      who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you can
      hustle or make a forced march for an additional hour without ill effects,
      but cannot do both in the same day. This benefit lasts until you eat a
      meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day's
      worth.</p>
