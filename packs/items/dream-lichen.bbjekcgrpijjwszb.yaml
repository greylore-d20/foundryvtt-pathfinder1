      <p>This multicolored, shimmering lichen grows in places where powerful
      magical creatures have slept and dreamt.</p>

      <p><b>Gather</b> DC 30; <b>Yield</b> 1 dose</p>

      <p><b>Terrain</b> anywhere the boundaries between the <em>Material
      Plane</em> and the Dimension of Dreams grow thin</p>

      <p><b>Preparation</b> The fibrous outer layer of the lichen must be gently
      scrubbed away, exposing the soft interior, which must then be allowed to
      dry after being sprinkled with various alchemical powders. This requires a
      successful DC 25 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check and 8 hours of work.</p>

      <p><b>Use</b> A creature that sleeps for at least 8 hours with a dose of
      <em>dream</em> lichen in contact with its body has vivid dreams in which
      it endures and recovers from a supernatural affliction. Upon waking, the
      creature can attempt a new saving throw against a single curse or
      <em>mind-affecting</em> effect from which it is currently suffering.
      Alternatively, the user automatically succeeds at a saving throw to remove
      a temporary <em>negative level</em>.</p>
