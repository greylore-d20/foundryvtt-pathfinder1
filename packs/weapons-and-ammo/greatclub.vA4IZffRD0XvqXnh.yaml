  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This larger, bulkier version of the common club is heavy enough that
      you can't wield it with one hand. It may be ornate and carved, reinforced
      with metal, or a simple branch from a tree. Like simple clubs, greatclubs
      have many names, such as cudgels, bludgeons, shillelaghs, and more.</p>
