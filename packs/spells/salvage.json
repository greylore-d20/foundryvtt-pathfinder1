Rotten wood turns solid once more, and sails re-weave themselves as the rigging snakes across the masts.</p><p>It takes a variable amount of time for the ship to rebuild itself, depending on its size.</p><p> <table><tr><th>Size</th><th>Duration</th></tr><tr><td>Raft</td><td>1 minute</td></tr><tr><td>Rowboat</td><td>1 minute</td></tr><tr><td>Keelboat</td><td>10 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Longship</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Sailing ship</td><td>2 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Warship</td><td>3 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Galleon</td><td>4 hours</td></tr></table>  At the end of the duration, an air bubble forms around the repaired ship. If submerged, the ship shoots to the surface, erupting with a great splash before settling on the water.</p><p>Though the spell requires time to repair the ship, its effects are instantaneous. A <i><i>salvage</i>d</i> ship cannot be dispelled to return it to a shipwreck. However, before the spell's duration ends and while the ship is still being repaired, <i>salvage</i> can be dispelled to interrupt the repair process. The ship remains in the condition it was in when the spell was interrupted until a new <i>salvage</i> spell is cast (but continues to age normally and suffers the effects of its environments). A new <i>salvage</i> spell's duration is modified by any repairs already begun.</p>",
