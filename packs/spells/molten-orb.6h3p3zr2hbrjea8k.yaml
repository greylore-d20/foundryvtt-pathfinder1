    value: >-
      <p>You create a fist-sized, red-hot ball of molten metal that you
      immediately hurl as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of fire
      damage. Every creature within 5 feet of where the ball hits takes 1d6
      points of fire damage from the splash (Reflex half). Each of these
      creatures takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on its turn for
      the next 1d3 rounds, unless it is cooled off (with water, snow, or any
      effect that deals 5 or more points of cold damage).</p>
