  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While he was researching the underlying causes of the resonance created
      by overlapping abjurations, Aram Zey discovered a way to manipulate that
      resonance to the caster's advantage when encountering magical
      traps.</p><p>The protection provided by Aram Zey's trap ward comes into
      play whenever the caster is subjected to the effects of a magical trap.
      The spell immediately discharges and interferes with the trap's function
      in an attempt to counter the trap's magic. When this occurs, make a caster
      level check as an immediate action. The DC of this check is equal to the
      trap's Disable Device DC. If you're successful, the trap ward dispels the
      magical effect of the trap before the effect actually manifests,
      effectively preventing the trap from triggering for the next 1d4 rounds
      and ending Aram Zey's trap ward immediately.</p>
