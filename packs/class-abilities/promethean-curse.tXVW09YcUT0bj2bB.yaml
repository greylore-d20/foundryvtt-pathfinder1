    value: >-
      <p>Your body is falling apart, forcing you to rely on mechanical
      augmentations or replacements to keep yourself alive. You take 1 point of
      Constitution damage each day, but you also ignore the first point of
      Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage you take for the remainder of
      that day.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, you gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws on effects that
      cause ability damage, ability drain, or ability score penalties.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, this bonus increases to +6.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, any effect that would normally deal ability drain on you
      instead deals ability damage whenever you successfully save against the
      effect.</p>
