  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You emanate an almost palpable aura of horror. All non-allies within this
    spell's area, or that later enter the area, must make a Will save to avoid
    becoming shaken. A successful save suppresses the effect. Creatures that
    leave the area and come back must save again to avoid being affected by the
    effect.</p>
