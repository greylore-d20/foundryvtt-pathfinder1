      <p>The target experiences feelings of ennui and lethargy, becoming
      fatigued for the spell's duration. While the target is fatigued and is
      within the spell's range, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and
      Dexterity. On a successful save, the target is fatigued for only 1d4
      rounds and you receive no bonus. This spell has no effect if it targets a
      creature that is already fatigued.</p>
