      <p>You cause the target to perceive itself as being covered in creeping,
      crawling, stinging bugs. This causes the target to become jittery and
      unable to stay still, forcing it to constantly move and twitch. The target
      takes a -4 penalty on all Dexterity checks and Dexterity-based skill
      checks, and cannot take the delay, ready, or total defense actions.</p>
