  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can fill a living creature with lethargy by hitting
      it with a melee touch attack, causing it to become staggered for 1 round.
      If the target is already staggered, it falls asleep for 1 round instead.
      An undead creature thatâ€™s touched is staggered for a number of rounds
      equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>
