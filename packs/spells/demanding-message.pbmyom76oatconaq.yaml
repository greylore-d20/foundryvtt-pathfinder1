      <p>This spell initially functions as <i>message</i> (allowing no save or
      spell resistance). Once during the <i>message</i> effect, you can
      concentrate as a standard action to issue a <i>suggestion</i> to one
      target as part of delivering a <i>message</i>. Spell resistance and a Will
      save apply to the <i>suggestion</i>, and it lasts for 1 hour per level or
      until completed.</p>
