    value: >-
      <p>The shaman and her tribe share a transcendent bond. Once per day when
      she communes with her spirit animal to regain spells, the shaman can
      select a number of creatures equal to half her shaman level to serve as
      her honorary tribe. These creatures can constantly communicate with each
      other, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.zuqlok69lapqc6lg]{Telepathic Bond}.</p>
