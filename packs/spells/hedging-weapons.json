    "shortDescription": "<p>A weapon made from divine force appears and floats near you. This weapon takes the shape of your deity's favored weapon (if you have no deity, the weapon appears as a simple weapon with special significance to you). You gain one additional weapon at 6th level and every 4 caster levels thereafter-two at 6th, three at 10th, four at 14th, and a maximum of five weapons at 18th level. The weapon averts and deflects attacks, granting you a +1 deflection bonus to AC for each weapon summoned (maximum +5 at 18th level). As a standard action, you can grasp a weapon and throw it as a ranged attack at any target you can see within 30 feet of you (even if it's a type of weapon that can't normally be thrown). On a successful hit, the weapon deals 2d6 points of force damage to the target. This force weapon has the same threat range and critical multiplier as a standard weapon of its type, but no other special abilities. Because it deals force damage, DR doesn't apply. Each weapon thrown lowers the total deflection bonus to your AC by 1 as it disappears immediately after the attack action. The spell immediately ends once you throw all the weapons.</p>",
