      <p>A hand-cranked press uses a plate on which all of the text on a page is
      carved in reverse. Changing the plate is a simple process, but creating a
      new one is expensive and labor-intensive. The press prints one page at a
      time, at a rate of about five pages per minute. A stationer then needs to
      cut and trim the pages and bind the book.</p>
