    value: >-
      <p>You gain temporary insight into the value of objects. You gain a +5
      competence bonus on Appraise checks, can attempt an Appraise check to
      determine an object's value as a move action, and can take 10 on an
      Appraise check even if stress or distractions would normally prevent you
      from doing so. You know if you fail an Appraise check, and you never
      determine a wildly inaccurate price.</p>
