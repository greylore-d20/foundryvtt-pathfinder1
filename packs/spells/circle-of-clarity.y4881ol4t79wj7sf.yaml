    value: >-
      <p>You create a magical emanation that interferes with all figments and
      glamers within it, giving creatures a +4 bonus on saving throws to
      recognize them as illusions. The emanation negates concealment less than
      total concealment within the area. Perception checks to notice creatures
      or objects within the area gain a bonus equal to half your caster level
      (maximum +10). The spell is stationary if cast on a point in space. It is
      mobile if centered on a creature or object, though creatures or attended
      objects can negate the spell with a saving throw or spell resistance.</p>
