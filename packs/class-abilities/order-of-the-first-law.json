      "value": "<p>Cavaliers belonging to the order of the First Law are dedicated to hunting down anyone practicing, preaching, or otherwise facilitating religion in Rahadoum.<br><br><strong>Edicts:</strong> The cavalier must strive to protect atheists and all those who reject the gods. He must never have a patron deity or willingly serve agents of the divine. He must protect the common folk from suffering due to the actions of divine agents.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the First Law cavalier issues a challenge, each round that he makes an attack against the target of his challenge, he gains 1 temporary hit point on his turn. These temporary hit points last up to 1 hour. The number of temporary hit points gained per round increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier possesses.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the First Law cavalier adds Heal (Wis) and Knowledge (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the First Law cavalier can attempt Knowledge (religion) skill checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1) when making checks to identify members of religious faiths or religious paraphernalia.</p>"
