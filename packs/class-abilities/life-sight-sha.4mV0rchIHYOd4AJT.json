She can also tell if those creatures are confused, disabled, diseased, nauseated, poisoned sickened or staggered.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, when using life sight she is able to sense all nearby living creatures; this functions similar to blindsight, but only for living creatures within 30 feet of her.</p>\n<p>The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to consecutive.</p>"
