  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a <em>standard action</em>, you can share your vital energy with a
      living creature that you touch. You take 1d6 points of <em>nonlethal
      damage</em> + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You cannot take
      an amount of <em>nonlethal damage</em> equal to or greater than your
      current hit point total; any excess is prevented. The recipient gains a
      number of <em>temporary hit points</em> equal to the amount of damage you
      received (prevented damage is not counted). These <em>temporary hit
      points</em> disappear 1 hour later. You may not use this ability to grant
      yourself <em>temporary hit points</em>. You can use this ability a number
      of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. This
      ability has no effect if you are immune to <em>nonlethal damage</em>.</p>
