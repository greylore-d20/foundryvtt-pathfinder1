  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your body dissolves, and you become a living shadow. This ability
      functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous Form}.</p>

      <p>At 14th level, this ability functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.6p5j2x5gjjsntyd6]{Shadow Body} instead, except you
      also gain DR 10/magic and become immune to poison, sneak attacks, and
      critical hits as if also using
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous Form}.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of minutes per day equal to your
      oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must
      be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to choose this revelation.</p>
