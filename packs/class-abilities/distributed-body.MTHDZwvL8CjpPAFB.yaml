    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, anytime you are struck by a <em>critical hit</em> or a
      <em>sneak attack</em>, there is a 25% chance that your nanites scatter and
      reincorporate around the attack, negating the extra damage and causing the
      attack to deal damage as normal instead.</p>
