  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak
    any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is
    allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the
    creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of
    this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which
    they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as
    they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area
    are free to speak as they choose.</p>
