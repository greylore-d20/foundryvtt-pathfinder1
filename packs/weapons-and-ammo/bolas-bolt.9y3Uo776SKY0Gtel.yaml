      <h3>Description</h3><p>Bolas bolts are bolas-like projectiles used as
      ammunition for slaver's crossbows. If you hit a target with a bolas bolt
      fired from a slaver's crossbow, attempt a trip combat maneuver against
      your target (don't add your Strength bonus when attempting the combat
      maneuver check). You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when
      using a bolas bolt.</p><p>On a critical hit, instead of dealing extra
      damage, the bolas bolt ensnares its target. Your target is entangled until
      it or an ally succeeds at a DC 15 Strength check to break the bolas cords.
      A light slaver's crossbow can entangle a target up to the same size as its
      intended wielder, and a heavy slaver's crossbow can entangle a creature up
      to one size larger. A masterwork bolas bolt or one with an enhancement
      bonus of at least +1 increases the DC of the Strength check to break the
      bolas to 20.</p><p>If the attack trips and entangles a target, the
      creature cannot move from its square until it breaks free of the bolas
      cords.</p>
