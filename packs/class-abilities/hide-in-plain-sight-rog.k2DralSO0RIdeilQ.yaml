    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent can select a single terrain from the rangerâ€™s
      favored terrain list. She is a master at hiding in that terrain, and while
      within that terrain, she can use the Stealth skill to hide, even while
      being observed. A rogue may take this advanced talent more than once, each
      time selecting a different terrain from the favored terrain list.</p>
