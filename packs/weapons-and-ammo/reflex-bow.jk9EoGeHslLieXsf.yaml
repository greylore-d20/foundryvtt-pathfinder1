  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These C-shaped bows are most often used in the Hongal tundra by the
      outriders of Tianjing, and in rare cases by the nobility of Xa Hoi. The
      unique shape and craft of these bows allows them to shoot with the same
      velocity and power as a longbow. The shorter size also allows them to be
      wielded easily while mounted on horseback (or atop any other steed). While
      mounted, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls with a reflex
      bow. All reflex bows are composite bows and can be modified to benefit
      from high Strength scores in the same way as composite bows. Effects that
      apply to both longbows and shortbows also apply to reflex bows.</p>
