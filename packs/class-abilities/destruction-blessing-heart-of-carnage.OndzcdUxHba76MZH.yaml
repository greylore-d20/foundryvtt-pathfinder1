  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you can touch an ally and bless it with even greater
      destructive power. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +4 insight bonus on
      attack rolls made to confirm critical hits and has a 50% chance to treat
      any critical hit or sneak attack against it as a normal hit.</p>
