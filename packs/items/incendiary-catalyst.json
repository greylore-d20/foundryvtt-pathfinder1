On a hit, the target is doused with accelerants that give the target <em>vulnerability</em> to fire for 1 round. Incendiary catalyst does not affect creatures that are already vulnerable to fire, and the target's fire <em>immunity</em> and resistances apply as normal. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check.</p>"
