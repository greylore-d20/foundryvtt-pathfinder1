  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This secure, portable enclosure is used to hold creaturesâ€” generally
      animals, but a large enough cage can hold anything. Cages are made from
      iron, wood, or bamboo, depending on local customs and available materials.
      One cage holds one animal of that size, or five animals of a smaller size.
      The weight of the creature adds to the weight of the cage. Cages come in
      the following sizes: Diminutive or Fine, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, and
      Huge. Cages for aquatic creatures cost twice as much, and weigh four times
      the normal weight when filled with water.</p>
