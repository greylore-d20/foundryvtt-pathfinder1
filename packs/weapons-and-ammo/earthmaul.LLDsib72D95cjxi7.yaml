      Siege Engine</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This war machine is fitted with an
      enormous hammer. When dropped into the horizontal position, it functions
      like a sideways-mounted catapult, and is capable of clearing wide swaths
      of enemies. Although it doesn't use ammunition, the earthmaul must
      effectively be reloaded by winding the torsion. When the earthmaul is
      activated, creatures on the ground in a 15-foot cone take 6d6 points of
      damage, are knocked 10 feet in the direction of the swing, and fall prone.
      A successful DC 20 Reflex saving throw halves the damage and negates the
      additional effects. An earthmaul has a hardness of 5 and 100 hit
      points.</p><p>An earthmaul is a Huge siege engine.</p>
