  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create
      a glowing orb of swirling lights that obeys your commands. This orb
      illuminates the area like the light spell. The orb can be commanded to
      hover over your shoulder, moving with you. As a move action, you can
      direct it to move up to 30 feet away from you. If the light matrix is ever
      more than 30 feet away from you, it returns to hover over your
      shoulder.</p>

      <p>If you are at least 5th level, you can direct the light matrix to make
      a melee touch attack against one foe within 30 feet. If the attack hits,
      the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds
      by a flash of light. If the attack hits, regardless of whether the target
      succeeds at the save, the light matrix immediately ends. The light matrix
      otherwise has a duration of 1 hour per occultist level you possess.</p>

      <p>You canâ€™t have more than one light matrix in existence at one time. If
      you use this power again, any previous light matrices immediately end.</p>
