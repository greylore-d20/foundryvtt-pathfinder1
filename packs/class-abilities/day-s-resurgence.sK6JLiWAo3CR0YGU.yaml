  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can restore a single creature as if it had just
      completed 8 hours of rest. It takes 10 minutes to use this power. If the
      use of this power is disrupted, it must be restarted, but it is not lost.
      At the end of the 10 minutes, a single willing creature that you have
      touched regains hit points as if it had rested for the night and may make
      new saving throws against effects that require a save once per day. The
      target does not suffer any negative effects if such saving throws are
      failed, but success counts toward removing the affliction (if possible).
      This ability does not allow a target to prepare spells an additional time
      per day. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one
      additional time per day for every 2 levels beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Nimbus of Light power of the Sun Domain.</p>
