      "value": "<p>At 20th level, your natural form becomes an animal-headed <em>humanoid</em>, like a true rakshasa. This does not affect your ability to speak or cast spells. You can use your <em>alter self</em> or other disguise and <em>polymorph</em> abilities to assume your original form or other forms when it suits you. You are forevermore treated as a <em>native</em> <em>outsider</em> rather than as a <em>humanoid</em> (or whatever your original type was) for the purpose of spells and other magical effects. Unlike other <em>outsiders</em>, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type. You gain <em>DR</em> 10/piercing.</p>"
