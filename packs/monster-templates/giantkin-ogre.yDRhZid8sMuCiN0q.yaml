      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Ogres sometimes interbreed with
      other giants. The result of such crossbreeding is a giantkin ogre, which
      gains some abilities from its non-ogre parents. In areas where ogre clans
      live near large populations of giants, interbreeding can be so common that
      entire ogre clans consist solely of giantkin.<p>Blessed with the blood of
      greater giants, giantkin ogres are larger and stronger than their normal
      ogre relatives and gain abilities from their giant
      progenitors.<p><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> Hit points +10 hit points; Saving
      Throws +1 racial bonus to all saving throws; Ability Scores +4 Strength,
      +4 Constitution; Special Attacks rock throwing (1d6, 90 ft.), Special see
