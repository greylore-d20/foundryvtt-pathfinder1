    value: >-
      <p>You curse the target with a hunger no food can assuage. On a failed
      saving throw, the target begins to starve (see page 444 of the <i>Core</i>
      Rulebook). The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage
      than the target has hit points. No amount of eating can counter the effect
      and, further, even attempting to eat causes the target to become nauseated
      for 1 round unless they make a DC 12 Fortitude save. The target still
      experiences the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons
      or potions).</p><p><i>Feast of Ashes</i> can be removed with a <i>break
      enchantment</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove
      curse</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell, but effects suffered as a result of
      starvation must be healed by normal means.</p>
