    <p>This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant
    creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice and
    they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal
    communication is impossible, the controlled plants do not attack you. At the
    end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal
    behavior.</p><p>Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply
    ignored.</p>
