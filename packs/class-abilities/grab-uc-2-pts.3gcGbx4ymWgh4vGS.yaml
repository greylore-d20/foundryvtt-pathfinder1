      <p>The eidolon becomes adept at grappling foes, gaining the grab ability.
      Select one of the following attacks: bite, claw, pincers, slam, tail slap,
      or tentacle. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the
      selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If successful,
      the eidolon grapples the target.</p>

      <p>This ability works only on creatures at least one size category smaller
      than the eidolon.</p>

      to grapple.</p>
