  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You reinforce a weapon or armor suit to give it a temporarily upgrade or
    mitigate the fragile quality (see page 146). A suit of armor or weapon
    touched that has the fragile quality is not considered to have the fragile
    quality for the spell's duration. Normal armor suits or weapons subjected to
    this spell instead gain the masterwork quality for the spell's duration and
    their hardness is doubled. If this spell is cast on masterwork or magical
    armor or weapons, their hardness is doubled for the duration of the
    spell.</p>
