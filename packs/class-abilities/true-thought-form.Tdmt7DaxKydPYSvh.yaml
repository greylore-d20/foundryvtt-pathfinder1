      <p>At 20th level, you can shed the restrictions of the flesh and become a
      thoughtformâ€” a being that exists independently of its substance.</p>

      <p>Whenever a creature would kill you, you can attempt to use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.nepwelwi6tlh1vo0]{Mind Swap} against that creature
      as an <em>immediate action</em> just before <em>dying</em>.</p>
