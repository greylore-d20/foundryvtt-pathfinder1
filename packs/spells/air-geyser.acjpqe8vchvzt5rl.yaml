    value: >-
      <p><em>You create a powerful blast of air capable of flinging an opponent
      upward.</em></p><p>If the target fails its Reflex save, the force of the
      air deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and hurls the target upward a
      number of feet equal to 5 x your caster level. If a solid object (such as
      a ceiling) is encountered, the target strikes the object in the same
      manner as it would during a normal fall. After this blast of air ceases,
      the target falls down (unless it was flying), taking falling damage as
      normal. A successful save means the target takes half damage from the air
      blast but is not moved by it.</p>
