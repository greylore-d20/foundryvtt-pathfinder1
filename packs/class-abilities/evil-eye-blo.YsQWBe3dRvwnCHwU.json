As a standard action, you can afflict one target within 30 feet that you can see, causing it to take a â€“2 penalty to AC and on attack rolls for 1 round per class level or until the target hits you with an attack. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your bloodrager level + your Charisma modifier). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>"
