    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, an omdura can call on the powers of her god once per day
      to aid in her struggle against her enemies. As a <em>swift action</em>,
      the omdura chooses one target within sight to be the focus of her divine
      might. If the target is opposed to the omdura’s <em>alignment</em> on
      either the law/chaos or the good/evil axis, the omdura adds half her
      <em>Charisma</em> bonus (minimum +o) to her <em>attack rolls</em> and adds
      half her omdura level to damage rolls against the target of her divine
      might. A neutral omdura can choose any target to be the target of her
      divine might, but she adds only one­ third her <em>Charisma</em> bonus and
      omdura level.</p>

      <p>In addition, while divine might is in effect, the omdura gains a
      <em>deflection bonus</em> equal to half her <em>Charisma</em> modifier
      (one-third for a neutral omdura) to her AC against attacks made by the
      target of the divine might. If a non­ neutral omdura targets a creature
      that is not opposed to her <em>alignment</em>, the use of this ability is
      wasted with no effect.</p>

      <p>The divine might effect remains until the target of divine might is
      <em>dead</em> or the next time the omdura rests and regains her uses of
      this ability. At 9th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the omdura can
      use divine might one additional time per day to a maximum of four times
      per day at 19th level.</p>
