      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Both<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Dread energies from the Plane of
      Shadow have leaked into the countryside of Nidal for thousands of years,
      pooling in shadowed groves and along darkened hillsides. Although normal
      animals shun these shadow-haunted regions, hunger or adversity sometimes
      compels a creature to enter them. Some animals who do so are wholly
      transformed by these energies, becoming shadow animals.<p>Shadow animals
      are more than mere animals, becoming hunters bleached of bright colors and
      commanding unusual predatory powers. Even herbivores that undergo this
      transformation become short tempered and dangerous.<p>Shadow animals have
      the brute cunning to understand spoken language, but they generally cannot
      speak.<p>The shadow animal template is inherited or acquired and can be
      added to any living, corporeal animal (referred to hereafter as the base
      creature). A shadow animal uses all the base creature’s statistics and
      special abilities except as noted.<p><b>CR:</b> If 9 HD or fewer, base
      creature’s CR + 1; if 10 HD or more, base creature’s CR +
      2.<p><b>Type:</b> The creature’s type changes to outsider (native). Do not
      recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.<p><b>Alignment:</b> Any (usually
      nongood).<p><b>Armor Class:</b> Reduce the creature’s natural armor, if
      any, by 1 (to a minimum of 0).<p><b>Senses:</b> A shadow animal gains
      darkvision with a range up to 60 feet and low-light vision if it didn’t
      already have it.<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A shadow animal gains the
      following defensive ability.<p><b>Shadow Blend (Su):</b> In any
      illumination other than bright light, a shadow animal blends into the
      shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). A shadow animal can
      suspend or resume this ability as a free action.<p><b>Speed:</b> All of
      the shadow animal’s movement speeds increase by 10 feet.<p><b>Special
      Abilities:</b> A shadow animal gains one of the following abilities for
      every 3 HD it has (round up).<p><em>Blinding Savagery (Ex):</em> Choose
      the rake, rend, or trample ability. Whenever the shadow animal creature
      uses the selected ability to deal damage to a creature, the damaged
      creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become blinded for 1
      round. The save DC is equal to 10 + half the shadow animal’s Hit Dice +
      the shadow animal’s Wisdom modifier. This ability can be selected up to
      three times, applying it to a different ability each time.<p><em>Energy
      Resistance (Ex):</em> The shadow animal gains cold resistance 10 or
      increases its existing cold resistance of 10 or greater to immunity to
      cold. This ability can be selected up to two times.<p><em>Evasion
      (Ex):</em> The shadow animal gains evasion, as per the rogue ability of
      the same name.<p><em>Fear Aura (Su):</em> Any creature within a 60-foot
      radius of the shadow animal that can see or hear it must succeed at a Will
      saving throw (DC = 10 + half the shadow animal’s HD + the shadow animal’s
      Charisma modifier) or be shaken for as long as it remains within the aura.
      Whether or not it succeeds at its save, that creature cannot be affected
      again by the same shadow animal’s fear aura for 24 hours. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect.<p><em>Frightful Presence (Su): </em>The shadow
      animal gains the frightful presence universal monster ability, which
      activates as a free action when the shadow animal charges, attacks during
      a surprise round, or succeeds at a DC 15 Intimidate check. Its frightful
      presence has a range of 30 feet and a duration of 5d6 rounds.<p><em>Hide
      in Plain Sight (Su): </em>The shadow animal can use Stealth even while
      being observed. As long as it is within 10 feet of a shadow other than its
      own, a shadow animal can attempt to use Stealth to hide itself from view
      even if it does not have cover or concealment.<p><em>See in Darkness
      (Su):</em> The shadow animal can see perfectly in darkness of any kind,
      including that created by deeper darkness.<p><em>Shadow Bite (Su):</em>
      The shadow animal can make one of its natural attacks through its shadow.
      Its reach with the selected natural attack increases by 5 feet, and a
      creature damaged by this natural attack must succeed at a Fortitude save
      (DC = 10 + half the shadow animal’s HD + the shadow animal’s Charisma
      modifier) or take 1 point of Strength damage in addition to the normal
      damage dealt.<p><em>Shadow Form (Su):</em> Once per day as a standard
      action, the shadow animal can turn into an animate pool of darkness for up
      to 10 minutes. This duration need not be used at all once, but it must be
      used in 1-minute increments. This ability functions as per gaseous
      form.<p><em>Shadow Spirit (Su): </em>The shadow animal gains a +4 racial
      bonus on saving throws against energy drain and death effects. This
      ability can be selected up to two times; if this ability is selected a
      second time, the shadow animal instead gains immunity to energy drain and
      death effects.<p><em>Shadow Step (Su): </em>The shadow animal can teleport
      up to 10 feet per Hit Die as a move action, so long as the creature starts
      and ends this travel in dim light or darkness. It can use this ability
      once every 1d4 rounds.<p><em>Spectral Attacks (Su):</em> The shadow
      animal’s natural attacks affect incorporeal creatures as if they had the
      ghost touch weapon special ability.<p><em>Spell Resistance (Ex):</em> The
      shadow animal gains SR equal to 11 + its CR. This does not stack with any
      SR the base creature has.<p><em>Umbral Fast Healing (Ex):</em> The shadow
      animal gains fast healing 1 when in areas of dim light or darkness. A
      shadow animal must have at least 10 HD to select this
      ability.<p><em>Vanish (Su): </em>As a swift action, the shadow animal can
      vanish for 1 round as if affected by invisibility. Each day, it can use
      this ability for 1 round per Hit Die. This ability’s duration need not be
      used all at once, but it must be used in 1-round
      increments.<p><b>Abilities:</b> A shadow animal gains a +4 bonus to
      Dexterity and Charisma and a +2 bonus to Intelligence and
      Wisdom.<p><b>Skills:</b> A shadow animal gains a +4 racial bonus on
      Intimidate and Stealth checks, which does not stack with any racial
      bonuses the base creature has. A shadow animal has a number of skill
      points per racial Hit Dice equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier. Its
      racial class skills are Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Intimidate, Perception,
      Stealth, and Swim.<p><b>Languages:</b> Shadow animals gain Common and
      Infernal, but if the base creature is unable to speak, it can only
      understand these languages.</p>
