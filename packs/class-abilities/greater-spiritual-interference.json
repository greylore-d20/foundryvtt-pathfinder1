      "value": "<p>At 12th level, whenever allies are within the phantom’s reach, as long as the manifested phantom is in ectoplasmic form, each ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. For the spiritualist, these bonuses increase to +4. The spiritualist and allies within range don’t gain this bonus if the manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious.</p>\n<p>While the phantom is incorporeally manifested, allies within 30 feet of the phantom receive a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. For the spiritualist, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus doesn’t apply if the phantom is unconscious.</p>"
