  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>At first glance resembling a baton-like stick with a sling dangling
      from each end, this weapon requires extraordinary skill, or halfling
      acrobatics, to use to full effect.</em></p>

      <p>You can use a double sling as a normal sling, or use the second end to
      make one additional ranged attack each round. You take the normal
      penalties for fighting with two weapons when you use both ends of a double
      sling (as if it were a double weapon); the Two- Weapon Fighting feat
      reduces these penalties as normal. Reloading one end of a double sling is
      a <em>move action</em> ( just like a normal sling), so unless you have an
      ability or feat (such as Ammo Drop) that allows you to quickly reload a
      sling, you cannot normally make multiple attacks per round for several
      consecutive rounds with this weapon.</p>

      <p>You can hurl ordinary stones with a double sling, but stones are not as
      dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the
      weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you,
      and you take a -1 penalty on <em>attack rolls</em>.</p>
