      <p>A <i>protective spirit</i> is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force
      that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a
      creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the <i>protective
      spirit</i> makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus
      your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage,
      but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A
      <i>protective spirit</i> can defend against a number of attacks of
      opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.</p><p>A
      <i>protective spirit</i> occupies your space, and moves with you. It
      cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>,
      <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>a sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of
      cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>protective spirit</i>'s AC against touch
      attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
