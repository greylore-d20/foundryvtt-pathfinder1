      <p>At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she
      can kip-up from prone as a move action without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. She can kip-up as a swift action instead by spending 1
      panache point.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
