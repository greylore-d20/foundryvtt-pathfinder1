      "value": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template </strong>Inherited<br><strong>Simple Template</strong> No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong> No<p>Within Kaoling, those oni that take the form of hobgoblins—known as ja noi—are treated as honored champions. While ja noi have an overwhelming need to engage in regular battle and command troops, and can be dangerous if too much time passes between fights, this drive is easily met by Kaoling’s regular military operations, and most hobgoblin soldiers are only too willing to fight at a ja noi’s command. While other oni are respected for their size and strength, they are generally treated as valued allies rather than members of Kaoling society. Ja noi, by contrast, are embraced as revered cousins, and closely integrated into Kaoling communities.<p>Though rare, sometimes such close association leads to children being born with one ja noi and one hobgoblin parent. These half-ja noi offspring are known as kanabo, a term that can also be used to refer to an iron club or translated as meaning “the strongest,” which is how the hobgoblins of Kaoling view the oni-kin among them. Kanabo inherit much of their oni parent’s vitality, mystic power, and cunning, but lack the ja noi drive to fight even when no foe is present.<p>Kanabo is an inherited template that can be added to a living, corporeal humanoid of the goblinoid subtype. A kanabo uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<p><strong>CR:</strong> HD 10 or less, as base creature + 1; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Lawful evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to outsider (native). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Defenses/Qualities: </strong>HD 11 or less, gains regeneration 1 (acid and fire); HD 12 or more, gains regeneration 5 (acid and fire).</p>\n<p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities: </strong>A kanabo with an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 8 or higher has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable 1/day. Caster level equals the creature’s HD (or the CL of the base creature’s spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).</p>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>HD</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Abilities</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1–2</td>\n<td><em>Doom</em> 3/day, <em>magic weapon</em> 3/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3–4</td>\n<td><em>Bull’s strength</em>, <em>command</em> 3/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6–8</td>\n<td><em>Fly</em> 3/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9+</td>\n<td><em>Alter self</em> (at will), <em>monstrous physique I</em> (at will, <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</em>)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p><br><strong>Abilities: </strong>A kanabo gains a +4 bonus to Strength and Constitution, and a +2 bonus to Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> A kanabo with racial HD has skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier for each racial HD.
