  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This one-handed axe is small and perfectly balanced for throwing, and
      can be used as a melee weapon. Throwing axes have a variety of alternative
      names, including franciscas, tomahawks, and more. The axe is normally
      gripped by the haft and thrown overhand, making one complete rotation in
      the air before biting into the target with the axe head.</p>
