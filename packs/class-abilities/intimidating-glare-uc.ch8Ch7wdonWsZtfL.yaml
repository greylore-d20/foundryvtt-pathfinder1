  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian adds her Strength modifier in place of her Charisma
      modifier on all Intimidate checks to demoralize a foe. She can attempt an
      Intimidate check to demoralize an adjacent foe as a move action instead of
      a standard action.</p>

      <p>If the barbarian successfully demoralizes an adjacent foe, that foe is
      shaken for the remainder of the barbarianâ€™s current rage.</p>
