  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilanteâ€™s social identity seems so innocent that it is hard to
      believe he was involved in wrongdoing. Within his area of renown, this
      provides a nonmagical effect identical to the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.4w51afqi5d9t8nl4]{Innocence} spell.</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social
      talent to take this talent.</p>
