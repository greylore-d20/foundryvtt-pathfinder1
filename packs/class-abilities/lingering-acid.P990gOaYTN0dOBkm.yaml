  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the arcanist uses the acid jet exploit, she can expend 2
      points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target
      takes additional damage on the following rounds if it fails its saving
      throw. The target takes 1d6 points of acid damage on the following round
      for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt by the initial attack. On
      subsequent rounds, the target continues to take 1d6 points of acid damage
      for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt on the previous round. The
      damage continues until the amount of acid damage dealt on the previous
      round by this effect is 1d6. For example, a 9th level arcanist would deal
      5d6 points of acid damage + the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier, 2d6 points
      of acid damage on the following round, and 1d6 points of acid damage on
      the third and final round.</p>

      <p>The arcanist must have the acid jet exploit to select this exploit.</p>
