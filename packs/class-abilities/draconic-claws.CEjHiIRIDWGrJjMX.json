      "value": "<p>Starting at 1st level, you can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. Each of these attacks deals 1d4 points of damage plus your <em>Strength</em> modifier (1d3 if you are Small). At 5th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming <em>DR</em>. At 7th level, the damage increases by one step to 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small). At 11th level, these claws deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of your energy type on a successful hit. You can use your claws for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>"
