  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the cavalier can inspire brutal malice among his allies.
      As a swift action, the cavalier can allow allies within 30 feet to deal
      nonlethal damage with their weapons without taking the usual â€“4 penalty
      (the weapon must still be capable of dealing nonlethal damage). Affected
      allies gain a +2 bonus on nonlethal weapon damage rolls. This effect lasts
      for 1 round and can be used once every 5 minutes.</p>
