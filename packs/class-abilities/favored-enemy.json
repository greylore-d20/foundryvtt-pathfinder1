Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them.

If a specific creature falls into more than one category of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>, the ranger’s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>"
