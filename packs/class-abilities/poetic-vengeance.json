      "value": "<p>You constantly plot and scheme to take your revenge against those who wrong you. Once per day as an immediate action, after an enemy successfully affects you with an attack (whether with a spell, a physical attack, or any other sort of attack), you can force the enemy to take half the effects of its own attack unless it succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier). Any damage from the attack is halved, and non-damaging effects have a 50% chance to apply. If the non-damaging effect has a DC, the enemy receives a saving throw against it, at either the DC of the original effect or the DC of this ability, whichever is lower.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you can use this ability twice per day, and at 20th level you can use it three times per day.</p>"
