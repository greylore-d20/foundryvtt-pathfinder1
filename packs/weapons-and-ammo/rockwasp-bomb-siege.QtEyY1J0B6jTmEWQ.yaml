      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Usable in catapults and trebuchets, this ammunition consists of a
      wooden crate packed with wax globes, from which a faint buzzing sound
      emanates.</p>

      <p>Visible as a dark shape at the center of each globe is a rat-sized
      hornet known as a rockwasp. The alchemical wax keeps the wasps
      immobilized, while tiny air holes allow them to breath.</p>

      <p>This ammunition <b>deals only half damage</b>, but releases a wasp
      swarm-two wasp swarms if used for a heavy catapult or heavy trebuchet. The
      wasps attack for 1 minute before dispersing.</p>

      <h3>Mishap</h3>

      <p>On a siege engine mishap, the wasps escape before the ammunition is
      launched.</p>
