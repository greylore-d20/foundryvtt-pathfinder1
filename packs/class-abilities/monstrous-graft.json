      "value": "<p>The alchemist can replace up to four of his own amputated limbs with those of a monstrous beast of the same size category. If the grafted limb is an arm, the alchemist gains either a climb speed of 15 feet or a claw or slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 for a Small alchemist). If the grafted limb is a leg, the alchemist gains one of the following benefits: a +5 bonus to land speed, a swim speed of 15 feet, or a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping. For each limb the alchemist replaces in this manner, he takes a â€“2 penalty to Wisdom as he loses his sense of self.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Derro\">Derros</a>&nbsp;are immune to this penalty.</p>"
