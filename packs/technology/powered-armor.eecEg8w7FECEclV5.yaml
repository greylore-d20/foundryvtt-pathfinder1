      armor represents the pinnacle of personal armor-a suit crafted of multiple
      skymetals and other materials designed to augment the wearer in numerous
      ways. The armor actually boosts land speed when worn, granting a +10 foot
      enhancement bonus to the wearer's speed. While worn, powered armor also
      grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. Powered armor
      protects against energy and the environment as if it were a spacesuit (see
      page 32). Powered armor has hardness 20 and 300 hit points. Powered armor
      is fitted with numerous small booster jets that grant the wearer a fly
      speed of 60 feet (with average maneuverability) in areas of no gravity and
      20 feet (with poor maneuverability) in gravity.</p><p>As a standard
      action, the wearer may activate the armor's self-repair system. The armor
      consumes a single charge and repairs 2d6 points of damage. Only 1 charge
      can be consumed per turn for this effect.</p><p>In addition, the following
      technological wonders are integrated into a suit of powered armor-each of
      these devices drains power from the suit's charges as appropriate when
      they are activated and
      used.</p><ul><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.technology.Item.1jPapJtuRXSOvAXr]{Camera}

      this laser pistol is always considered an off-hand attack, and the number
      of times it can be fired cannot be increased by feats like Improved Two
