  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you may create a bond between yourself and
      another creature. Each round at the start of your turn, if the bonded
      creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points,
      it heals 5 hit points and you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have
      one bond active per oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded
      creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other creature
      exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have
      multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same
      immediate action).</p>
