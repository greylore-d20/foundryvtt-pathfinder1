  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This simple fiber or leather cord has a knot at either end. One end is
      wound once around the notch of a throwing arrow (see New Ammunition,
      below). The cord runs taut along the shaft to the front of the arrow,
      where you hold the arrow to throw. The remainder of the cord wraps around
      your hand. The cord dramatically increases the throwing arrow's range.
      Attaching the cord to a throwing arrow is a move action that requires two
      hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. The Rapid Reload feat can be
      taken for throwing arrow cords, allowing you to load a throwing arrow as a
      free action.</p>
