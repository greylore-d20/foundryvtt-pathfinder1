      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong> arms
      (cybernetic)</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> -; <strong>Usage</strong>
      -</p><h3>Description</h3><p><strong>Install</strong> DC 38;
      <strong>Implantation</strong> 4</p><p>The <em>Arms of the Iron God</em>
      replace the arms, shoulders, and much of the recipient's spine. They
      double the creature's lifting and carrying capacity, grant a +5
      circumstance bonus on Climb checks, and grant a +5 bonus to CMD against
      disarm attempts. The <em>Arms</em> also grant the user a +4 enhancement
      bonus to Strength.</p><p>Each arm ends in an electrified claw that grants
      the wielder a claw attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. These claw
      attacks are always primary attacks, even while a one-handed weapon is
      wielded and the other claw is used to make an additional attack. The claws
      function as +3 shocking burst weapons. As a free action, one of the claws
      can be transformed into a <em>+3 shocking burst battleaxe</em>-returning
      it to its claw form is a move action. When the claw transforms, any item
      held in or worn on that hand drops. Attacks made with this battleaxe gain
      a +2 bonus on damage rolls, but it cannot be wielded with two
      hands.</p><p>The <em>Arms</em> also function as a divine focus for
      spellcasting if the user worships Unity-even for unusually expensive
      divine focuses, such as the focus needed for
      <em>destruction</em>.</p><h2>Destruction</h2><p>Once Unity is destroyed,
      the <em>Arms of the Iron God</em> can be destroyed as a normal item
      (hardness 15, hp 120).</p>
