      <p>Although it is a rare occurrence, paladins do sometimes stray from the
      path of righteousness. Most of these wayward holy warriors seek out
      redemption and forgiveness for their misdeeds, regaining their powers
      through piety, charity, and powerful magic. Yet there are others, the dark
      and disturbed few, who turn actively to evil, courting the dark powers
      they once railed against in order to take vengeance on their former
      brothers. It’s said that those who climb the farthest have the farthest to
      fall, and antipaladins are living proof of this fact, their pride and
      hatred blinding them to the glory of their forsaken patrons.</p>

      <p>Antipaladins become the antithesis of their former selves. They make
      pacts with fiends, take the lives of the innocent, and put nothing ahead
      of their personal power and wealth. Champions of evil, they often lead
      armies of evil creatures and work with other villains to bring ruin to the
      holy and tyranny to the weak. Not surprisingly, paladins stop at nothing
      to put an end to such nefarious antiheroes.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Antipaladins are villains at their most dangerous. They
      care nothing for the lives of others and actively seek to bring death and
      destruction to ordered society. They rarely travel with those that they do
      not subjugate, unless as part of a ruse to bring ruin from within.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: Chaotic evil.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d10.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175 gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>
