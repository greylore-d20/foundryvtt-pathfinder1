Misfiring with a cylinder rifle causes rogue sparks to cause the gun to erratically fire all the remaining bullets loaded in the disk, and each stray bullet has a 50% chance to hit the wielder, dealing 1d6 points of damage.</p>\n<p>Reloading a cylinder rifle requires two full-round actions, regardless of the number of slots being loaded. The @Compendium[pf-content.pf-feats.5MEcO5qLxNgAM7zs]{Rapid Reload} feat reduces this to a single full-round action.</p>"
