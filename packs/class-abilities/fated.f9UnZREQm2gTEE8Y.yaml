  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain a +1 luck bonus on all of your
      <em>saving throws</em> and to your <em>AC</em> during surprise rounds (see
      <em>Combat</em>) and when you are otherwise unaware of an attack. At 7th
      level and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a
      maximum of +5 at 19th level.</p>
