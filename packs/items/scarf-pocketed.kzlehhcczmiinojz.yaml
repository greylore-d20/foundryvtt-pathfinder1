      <p>An elaborate design disguises several small pockets on one side of this
      scarf. This scarf grants you a +4 bonus on <em>Sleight of Hand</em> checks
      made to hide objects on your body. This bonus does not stack with the
      bonus wearing heavy clothing provides but does stack with bonuses for
      attempting to hide small objects.</p>
