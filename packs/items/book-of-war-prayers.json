If you have a <em>Charisma</em> of 13 or higher, or at least 1 rank in <em>Perform</em> (oratory), you can read aloud prayers from the book before battle to hearten others for the trials to come. Reading prayers for this effect takes 10 minutes. You grant those who hear your prayers a +2 <em>morale bonus</em> on the next saving throw against fear they attempt, as long as that saving throw is made in the next 24 hours. <b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1129</em></p>\r\n"
