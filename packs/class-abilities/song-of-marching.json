By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core Rulebook&nbsp;170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue.</p>\n<p>The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p>"
