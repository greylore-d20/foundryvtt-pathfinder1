      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A boarding pike is an 8-foot-long pole topped
      with a foot-long tapered metal tip. Boarding pikes look much like
      longspears, but the metal pike is designed to flow into the wooden haft,
      leaving no grooves, collars, or spikes that could trap salt water and
      cause rust. Boarding pikes are mainly used defensively, to repel boarding
      actions. The pikes are kept in brackets around the mast, so sailors can
      quickly grab pikes and brace them against the gunwale to repel
      boarders.</p>
