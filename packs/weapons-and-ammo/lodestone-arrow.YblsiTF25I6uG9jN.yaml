      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This heavy iron arrowhead is sealed with an alchemical resin. Pulling a
      small string (a move action) breaks the seal and triggers a reaction in
      the arrowhead, greatly increasing its magnetic properties.</p>

      <p>You gain a <b>+4 circumstance bonus on attack rolls</b> when firing a
      lodestone arrow at a target wearing metal armor or a target made of metal,
      but the magnetized arrow <b>deals only half damage</b> on a successful
      hit.</p>

      <p>The increased magnetism fades 1 round after you activate a lodestone
      arrow, after which it becomes a normal arrow.</p>
