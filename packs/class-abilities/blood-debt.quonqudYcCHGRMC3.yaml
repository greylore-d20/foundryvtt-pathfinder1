  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A ninja with this ability gains In Harm’s Way as a bonus feat, even if
      she doesn’t meet the prerequisites. When the ninja intercepts an attack
      using this feat, she can spend 1 ki point to impose a blood debt on the
      aided ally. The ninja’s ki pool is reduced by 1 until she ends this
      effect, which she may do as an immediate action. If the ninja ends the
      blood debt in response to a successful attack against her by a creature
      the indebted ally threatens, the ally (who must be willing) takes full
      damage from that attack and any associated effects instead of the
      ninja.</p>
