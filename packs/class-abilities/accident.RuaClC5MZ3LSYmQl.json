On a successful check, the target falls prone and takes 1d6 points of damage. If the target is adjacent to a pit or similar drop-off, he must also succeed at a Reflex save (with a DC equal to the shaman’s caster level check) or fall into the pit. Observers must succeed at a Perception or Sense Motive check with a DC equal to the shaman’s caster level check to identify her as the source of the accident.</p>"
