    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create
      a minor figment. This can function as either
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mtxqp85izkb20djq]{Ghost Sound} or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.27o3msobhyghmfid]{Minor Image}. In either case, the
      effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level.</p>

      <p>If you are 7th level or higher, the figment lasts for a number of
      minutes equal to your occultist level, and you can cause the figment to
      change once during its duration when a specified condition occurs.</p>
