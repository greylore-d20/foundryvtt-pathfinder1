  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While another individual attempts to give an account of an event, the
      character makes an opposed Diplomacy check to deftly interject comments or
      statements over the course of the storytelling that cause the individual
      to muddle his ability to recall accurate or specific details. If the rogue
      succeeds, her target remains unaware that the character’s interjections caused
      the confusion. However, if she fails, the target is allowed a Sense Motive
      check (DC equal to the rogue’s failed Diplomacy check) to figure out that
      she made deliberate attempts to confuse the story.</p>
