  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Any nongood creature within the area of a <i>holy word</i> spell suffers
    the following ill effects.</p> <table border
    ='1'><tr><th>HD</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>Equal to caster
    level</td><td>Deafened</td></tr><tr><td>Up to caster level
    -1</td><td>Blinded, deafened</td></tr><tr><td>Up to caster level
    -5</td><td>Paralyzed, blinded, deafened</td></tr><tr><td>Up to caster level
    -10</td><td>Killed, paralyzed, blinded, deafened</td></tr></table> The
    effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or
    eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only
    one save and apply the result to all the effects.</p><p><i>Deafened</i>: The
    creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds. Save negates.</p><p><i>Blinded</i>: The
    creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds. Save reduces the blinded effect to 1d4
    rounds.</p><p><i>Paralyzed</i>: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for
    1d10 minutes. Save reduces the paralyzed effect to 1
    round.</p><p><i>Killed</i>: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are
    destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead
    takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
    +25).</p><p>Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this
    spell, nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished
    back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least
    24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear
    the <i>holy word</i> or not. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a
    -4 penalty) to negate.</p><p>Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are
    unaffected by <i>holy word</i>.</p>
