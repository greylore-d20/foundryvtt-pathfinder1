      "value": "<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> SoS</p>\n<p>This metal framework of parallel strips is used to duplicate drawings, allowing enlarging (up to twice the original size) or shrinking (down to half the original size) of the copy in the process. The pantograph is anchored, then fitted with a stylus and a writing implement such as chalk, an ink pen, or a pencil. As the stylus is traced over the drawing or other item to be duplicated, the pantograph reproduces the motions, creating a copy. While handy for making quick, accurate copies of ancient carvings, runes, and drawings, a pantograph is unable to produce a convincing forgery. More elaborate and expensive pantographs allow even larger or smaller copies to be made, or multiple copies to be made at the same time.</p>\n<h4>Printing Press</h4>\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO9410</em></p>\n<p>A hand-cranked press uses a plate on which all of the text on a page is carved in reverse. Changing the plate is a simple process, but creating a new one is expensive and labor-intensive. The press prints one page at a time, at a rate of about five pages per minute. A stationer then needs to cut and trim the pages and bind the book.</p>\n<h4>Quill, Poisoned</h4>\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> PPC:P&amp;P</p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 30 gp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>\n<p>DESCRIPTION</p>\n<p>This long pen is made from a delicate feather and has a thin and unusually long nib. The quill is typically white in color, though variations that are crimson, onyx, or some combination of these colors also exist. A hidden compartment inside the nib allows the quill to hold a single dose of <em>poison</em> that is dispensable with a small squeeze. Additionally, this provides a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Sleight of Hand</em> checks to conceal poisons inside the quill. If this quill is used with vector ink, it increases the DC of a poison mixed with the ink by 1.</p>\n<p>This quill can be used as a small shiv to deal 1d3 points of damage and deliver its contained poison. However, because of the fragility of the nib, using the quill in this way destroys it.</p>\n<h4>Wax, Sealing</h4>\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1110</em></p>\n<p>Solid wax used for sealing scroll tubes or <em>scrolls</em> together.</p>"
