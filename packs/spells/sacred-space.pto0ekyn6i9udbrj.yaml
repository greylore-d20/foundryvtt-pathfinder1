  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell sanctifies an area with heavenly power. The DC to resist
    spells or spell-like abilities with the good descriptor or channeled energy
    that damages evil outsiders (as when using Alignment Channel) increases by
    +2. In addition, evil outsiders take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage
    rolls, and saving throws, and they cannot be called or summoned into a
    <i>sacred space</i>. If the <i>sacred space</i> contains an altar, shrine,
    or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or
    good-aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled. You cannot
    cast <i>sacred space</i> in an area with a permanent fixture dedicated to a
    deity other than yours.</p>
