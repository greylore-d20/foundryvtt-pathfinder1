      <p>Starting at 1st level, a summoner can cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.kyo0kwhw2jhuztju]{Summon Monster I} as a spell-like
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.
      Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to
      call his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this ability when his
      eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action and
      the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per
      level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this
      ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful
      creatures (to a maximum of @Compendium[pf1.spells.mi52crelhwuy6bmp]{Summon
      Monster IX} at 17th level). At 19th level, this ability can be used as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ursm11405zobemi3]{Gate} or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mi52crelhwuy6bmp]{Summon Monster IX}. If used as
      gate, the summoner must pay any required material components. A summoner
      cannot have more than one summon monster or gate spell active in this way
      at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster or
      gate immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of
      his spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion
      items. In addition, he can expend uses of this ability to fufill the
      construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can
      use this ability to cast the required spell.</p>
