  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You restore the senses to the severed head of a humanoid or monstrous
      humanoid killed within the past 24 hours, creating a grisly sentinel. The
      head must be affixed to a pole, spear, tree branch, or other stable
      object, and the spell ends if the head or its object is moved. The head
      has darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision, can swivel in place to look
      in any direction, and has a +5 bonus on Perception checks.  If you are
      within 30 feet of the head, as a standard action you can shift your senses
      to it, seeing and hearing from its location and gaining the benefit of its
      darkvision and low-light vision, and you may use its Perception skill
      instead of your own. While your senses are in the severed head, your body
      is blind and deaf until you spend a free action to shift your senses back
      to your own body.  When you create the head, you can imprint it with a
      single triggering condition, similar to <i>magic mouth</i>. Once this
      triggering condition is set, it can never be changed. If you are within 30
      feet of the head, you immediately know if it is triggered (if you have
      multiple active <i>sentry skulls</i>, you also know which one was
      triggered). This wakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise
      disturb your concentration. For example, you could have a <i>sentry
      skull</i> alert you if any humanoid comes into view, if a particular rival
      approaches, if your guard animal is killed, and so on, as long as it
      occurs where the severed head can see it.  This spell does not give the
      head any ability to speak, think, or take any kind of action other than to
      turn itself, though it is a suitable target for other spells such as
      <i>magic mouth</i>.</p>
