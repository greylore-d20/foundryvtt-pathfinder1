      <p>This spell instantly renders you unseen as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.oylikodnyku2zewu]{invisibility}, but
      creates a visual and auditory display that makes it appear as if you had
      <em>teleport</em>ed away. You can affect one additional Medium or smaller
      creature or its equivalent per 3 caster levels (a Large creature counts as
      two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and
      so forth). All creatures to be affected must be in contact with one
      another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
      If a viewer identifies the spell with a successful Spellcraft check, she
      can attempt an immediate Will saving throw as if interacting with an
      illusion. With a successful Will save, the observer can correctly identify
      fool's <em>teleport</em> for what it is; otherwise, she perceives the
      spell to be <em>dimension door</em>, <em>teleport</em>, or similar
      conjuration magic. A successful Will save doesn't negate the
      <em>invisibility</em>.</p>
