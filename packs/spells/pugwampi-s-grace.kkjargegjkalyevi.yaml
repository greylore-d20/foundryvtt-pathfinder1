  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Hated by adventurers throughout the Inner Sea region, the gremlins
      known as pugwampis infect those around them with a malignant form of
      unluck-an effect that this spell emulates. If the target fails its Will
      save, it becomes infused with the so-called "grace of the pugwampi." A
      creature affected by this spell must roll two d20s whenever a situation
      calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving
      throw) and must use the lower of the two results generated. As with the
      aura shed by actual pugwampies, this spell has no effect on animals,
      gremlins, or gnolls. The effects of this spell are negated as long as a
      target gains any sort of luck bonus to a d20 roll (such as those granted
      by a <i>luckstone</i> or <i>divine</i> favor), but the spell's duration is
      not impacted by these effects. If the luck bonus goes away before the
      pugwampi's grace effect ends, the unluck returns and remains until the
      spell's normal duration runs out.</p>
