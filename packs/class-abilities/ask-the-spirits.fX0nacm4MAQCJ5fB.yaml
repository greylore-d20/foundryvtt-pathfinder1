  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, a medium can send his consciousness to the Astral Plane
      any number of times per day to ask the spirits for advice, as if using
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.68ngvzmzvadhf6vs]{Contact Other Plane} to contact
      the Astral Plane. The medium automatically succeeds at the Intelligence
      check to avoid the possible decrease to his Intelligence and Charisma.</p>
