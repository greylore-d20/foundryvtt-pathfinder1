The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the <i>sepia snake</i> dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of duncolored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed.</p><p>While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.</p><p>The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and <i>detect magic</i> reveals only that the entire text is magical.</p><p>A <i>dispel magic</i> can remove the sigil. An <i>erase</i> spell destroys the entire page of text.</p><p><i>Sepia snake sigil</i> can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as secret page.</p>"
