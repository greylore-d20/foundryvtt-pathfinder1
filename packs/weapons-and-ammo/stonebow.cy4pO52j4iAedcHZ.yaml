  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A stonebow, or bullet crossbow, resembles a light crossbow except for
      the distinct U-shaped bend in the stock. Instead of bolts, the stonebow
      shoots sling bullets. The bow has two strings with a leather pocket
      between them to hold the bullet. Loading a stonebow is a move action (a
      free action if you have the Rapid Reload feat) that provokes attacks of
      opportunity.</p><p>You can shoot ordinary stones with a stonebow, but
      stones aren't as dense or as round as bullets. When using stones, you take
      a -1 penalty on attack rolls and deal damage as if the weapon were
      designed for a creature one size category smaller than you.</p><p>You can
      shoot, but not load, a stonebow with one hand, but doing so imposes a -2
      penalty on your attack rolls. You can shoot a stonebow with each hand, but
      you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.
      This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for firing one-handed.</p>
