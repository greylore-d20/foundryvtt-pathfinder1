    value: >-
      <p>Whether through mutation or alchemy, some vigilantes have flesh that is
      as moldable as clay and as fluid as ink. A vigilante with this talent
      gains the <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterSubtypes.aspx?ItemName=Shapechanger">shapechanger</a>
      subtype and the <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Compression">compression</a>
      universal monster rule. In addition, the vigilante can alter his
      appearance as @Compendium[pf1.spells.oj36nfak6jc2s5ky]{Disguise Self},
      except that the changes are physical rather than illusory. However,
      aspects of the vigilanteâ€™s aesthetic persist in all forms, halving the
      bonus on Disguise checks gained from this effect and from seamless
      guise.</p>

      <p>At 12th level, the vigilante can pass through narrow openings, even
      mere cracks, along with any item he wears or carries (to a maximum of his
      light load).</p>
