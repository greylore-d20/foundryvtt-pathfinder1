  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You curse your target with a withering aura that degrades its armor and
    shield (if any). This reduces the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement
    bonus of any armor or shield worn by the target by 1. For every hour the
    target wears a suit of armor or a shield, the hardness, armor bonus, and
    enhancement bonus are reduced by an additional 1. If the armor or shield's
    hardness is reduced to 0, anytime the target of the curse is struck while
    wearing that item, there is a 20% chance that it gains the broken condition.
    If the enhancement bonus of magic suit of armor or shield is reduced to 0,
    the armor or shield loses any other special abilities it had.  If the target
    removes the suit of armor or shield (even if it's broken or has been drained
    of all enhancement bonuses), the armor or shield regains its hardness, armor
    bonus, and enhancement bonus at the rate of 1 per 2 hours. A suit of armor
    or shield broken by this curse that regains its full hardness ceases to be
    broken. A magic suit of armor or shield that lost its special abilities
    regains them when its enhancement bonus is fully restored.</p>
