  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This heavy, reinforced helmet can be used to make melee attacks. The
      wearer may also use the helmet when attempting bull rush maneuvers,
      granting a +2 circumstance bonus on the check, but after completing the
      maneuver (whether successful or not), the wearer is staggered until the
      end of his next turn. In addition, the helmet grants a +2 circumstance
      bonus to the wearer's AC against critical hit confirmation rolls. A
      dwarven boulder helmet adds 20% to the wearer's arcane spell failure
      chance. It occupies the head slot and is made of metal, not stone, meaning
      that it can be crafted from unusual materials as a metal weapon. A dwarven
      boulder helmet can be enchanted as a weapon (not as armor, despite
      providing some protection).</p>
