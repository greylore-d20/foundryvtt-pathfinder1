    <p>You gain temporary insight into your enemies' magical
    defenses.</p><p>When you next cast a spell before the end of the next round,
    treat your caster level as 5 higher than normal for the purpose of
    overcoming spell resistance. This bonus doesn't increase any other effects
    that depend on caster level, such as the spell's damage or range, and
    affects only the first spell cast after <i>sure casting</i>.</p>
