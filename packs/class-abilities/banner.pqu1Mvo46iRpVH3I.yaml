      <p>At 5th level, a cavalier’s banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to
      his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier’s banner is clearly
      visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving
      throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of
      a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses
      increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be
      carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function.</p>
