      weapon is often used in gladiatorial events due to its versatility. The
      body of the weapon is a standard short spear, primarily used for
      thrusting. The butt of the spear is fitted with a length of chain, often
      spiked, with a hook at the end. The hook and chain may be used to make
      trip attacks. If your trip attack fails by 10 or more, you may drop the
      chain spear to avoid being knocked prone.</p>
