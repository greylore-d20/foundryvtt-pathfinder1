  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic
      until the end of the shaman’s next turn. Whenever the creature is attacked
      with a melee or ranged weapon constructed primarily of metal, it takes a
      –2 penalty to AC.</p>

      <p>At 8th and 16th levels, the penalty increases by –2 and the duration
      extends by 1 round.</p>

      <p>Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for
      24 hours.</p>
