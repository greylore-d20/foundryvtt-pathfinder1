  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell disrupts the method a target uses for movement. Creatures
      under the effects of this spell move at half their base speed (rounded
      down to the nearest 5-foot increment) but can still take 5-foot steps as
      normal. Incorporeal creatures and creatures flying with perfect
      maneuverability are immune to the effects of this spell. Each round, a
      target receives another save to end the effect.</p>
