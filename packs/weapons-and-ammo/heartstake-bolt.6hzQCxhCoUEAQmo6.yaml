      <p>Specially crafted from solid darkwood, heartstake bolts are
      specifically designed to slay vampires. A heartstake bolt can be fired
      from any crossbow, but it imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll and
      halves the range increment of the weapon. A vampire struck with a
      heartstake bolt takes the normal damage but must also succeed at a DC 20
      Fortitude saving throw or fall to the ground helpless for 1 round.</p>

      <p>While the vampire is helpless in this manner, a creature can attempt to
      use the heartstake bolt to finish off the vampire by driving it through
      the vampire's heart as a full-round action. Once the debilitating effect
      of the heartstake bolt has ended, the vampire can pull out the bolt as a
      move action. A vampire slain with a heartstake bolt is subject to the
      rules and limitations of slaying a vampire with a wooden stake as
      described under vampire weaknesses .</p>

      <p>A heartstake bolt deals normal damage for the crossbow of its type.</p>
