    value: >-
      <p>Through sheer willpower, you can keep your body going longer than
      should be possible. You add your Wisdom bonus (minimum +1) to your
      Constitution score to determine the negative hit point total at which you
      die, and as a bonus on Constitution checks to become stable or regain
      consciousness.</p>
