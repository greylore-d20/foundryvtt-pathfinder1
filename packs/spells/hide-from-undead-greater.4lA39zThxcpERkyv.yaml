      <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.rekl0ikgnorz60jc]{Hide
      from Undead}, except the spell does not immediately end if a warded
      creature attempts to turn or command undead, channels positive energy,
      touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature. Instead, when the
      warded creature takes one of these actions, an intelligent undead creature
      can attempt another Will saving throw to negate the effects of the
      spell.</p>
