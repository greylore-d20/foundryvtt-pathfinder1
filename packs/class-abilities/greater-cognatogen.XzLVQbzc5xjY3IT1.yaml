  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist’s mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6
      alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score. The
      alchemist takes a –2 penalty on both associated physical ability scores as
      long as the mutagen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to both
      associated physical ability scores when the cognatogen ends.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the cognatogen
      discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.</p>
