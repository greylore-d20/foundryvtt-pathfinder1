      <p>When you cast this spell, you conjure a single ball of sticky mud and
      launch it at an enemy's face as a ranged touch attack. If the mudball
      hits, the target is blinded. Each round at the beginning of its turn, a
      creature blinded by this spell can attempt a Reflex saving throw to shake
      off the mud, ending the effect. The mudball can also be wiped off by the
      creature affected by it or by a creature adjacent to the creature affected
      by it as a standard action.</p>
