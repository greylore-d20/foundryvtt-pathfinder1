    value: >-
      <p><em>You can channel your divine energy through a melee weapon you
      wield.</em><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Channel energy class
      feature.<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Before you make a melee attack roll,
      you can choose to spend one use of your channel energy ability as a swift
      action. If you channel positive energy and you hit an undead creature,
      that creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage
      dealt by your channel positive energy ability. If you channel negative
      energy and you hit a living creature, that creature takes an amount of
      additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel negative
      energy ability. Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this
      additional damage. If your attack misses, the channel energy ability is
      still expended with no effect.<h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>When making an
      attack using this feat, you can spend a number of stamina points up to the
      number of dice in your channel energy. For each stamina point you spend in
      this way, add an additional 1d6 points of positive or negative energy
      damage to your Channel Smite attack. This damage is also halved if the
      target succeeds at its Will save against the Channel Smite
      attack.</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link this feat to Channel Energy
      charges.</p>
