  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode
      into shards of shrapnel that deal piercing damage. A creature that takes a
      direct hit from a scrap bomb takes 1 point of bleed damage per die of bomb
      damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save.</p>
