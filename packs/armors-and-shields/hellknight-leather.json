Primarily worn by Hellknight sailors, this studded leather armor includes heavy gloves and a helm of sculpted leather designed to look like a skull— either a human’s or that of some aquatic creature. Hellknight leather’s statistics are identical to those of studded leather, except it costs 5 gp more and weighs 5 pounds more.</p>"
