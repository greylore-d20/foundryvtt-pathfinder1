      <p>You banish psychic impressions from the object touched, rendering it
      devoid of recent history. You choose how much time to erase, up to a
      maximum of 1 day per caster level. You must <i>erase impressions</i> from
      the present time back; you cannot choose to leave recent events untouched.
      Impressions erased in this manner cannot be recovered via <i>object
      reading</i>, <i>legend lore</i>, or similar measures.  Casting <i>erase
      impressions</i> o n a corpse r emoves recent psychic impressions from when
      the creature was alive as well, making those memories unavailable to
      <i>speak with dead</i>. For example, a 5th-level caster casting the spell
      on a 2-day-old corpse could erase the past 2 days of psychic impressions
      from the corpse and 3 additional days of information from just before the
      creature died.</p>
