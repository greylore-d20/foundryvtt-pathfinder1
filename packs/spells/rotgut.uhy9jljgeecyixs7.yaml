  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You transform the target into a cheap alcohol of your choice, such as
    beer, grog, mead, rum, or wine. The alcohol doesn't taste good, but it's
    drinkable and just as effective as normal alcohol in making creatures
    inebriated (<i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> 237). This spell doesn't
    work on holy water, potions, magical liquids, or water that is part of a
    creature.</p>
