  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common
      in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry.
      The lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered
      windows, and a small fireplace.</p><p>The shelter must be heated as a
      normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants.
      The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise-it is
      as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material
      composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It
      is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines
      or giants).</p><p>The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against
      intrusion, the former two being secured with <i>arcane lock</i> and the
      latter by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these
      three areas are protected by an <i>alarm</i> spell. Finally, an <i>unseen
      servant</i> is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the
      shelter.</p><p>The <i>secure shelter</i> contains crude furnishings-eight
      bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.</p>
