      <p>The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so,
      complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it
      impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in
      place. The effect imposes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and a -10 penalty on
      Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target
      holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on
      its turn. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this effect to 1
      round.</p>
