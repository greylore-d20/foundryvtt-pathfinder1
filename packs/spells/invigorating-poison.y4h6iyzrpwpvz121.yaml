  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The body of the target creature gains a metabolic response that allows
      it to benefit from normally deadly toxins. When a poison would cause
      ability damage to the target creature, the target instead gains a +4
      alchemical bonus to that ability score. The spell then immediately ends,
      but the bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of ability
      damage the poison would have caused. If the poison would deal more than
      one type of ability damage, each bonus has a separate duration. If the
      poison has effects other than ability damage (such as unconsciousness or
      ability drain), these effects apply normally. This spell affects only a
      single poison; if multiple poisons affect the target simultaneously, this
      spell prevents only ability damage and grants the appropriate bonuses for
      the poison that would cause the most damage.</p>
