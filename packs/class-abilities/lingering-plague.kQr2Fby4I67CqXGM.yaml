  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Any creature that must make a save against a disease caused by the
      alchemist’s extract or other class ability must make a second save 1 round
      later to avoid doubling the duration of the disease effect. If the disease
      doesn’t have a duration, this discovery reduces its onset time and
      frequencies by half.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
