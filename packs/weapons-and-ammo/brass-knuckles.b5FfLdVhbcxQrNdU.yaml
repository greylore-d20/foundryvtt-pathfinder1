  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These weapons fit snugly around the knuckles and allow you to deal
      lethal damage with an unarmed strike. You may hold, but not wield, a
      weapon or other object in a hand wearing brass knuckles. You may cast a
      spell with a somatic component while wearing brass knuckles if you make a
      successful concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you're
      casting). Monks are proficient with brass knuckles. Brass knuckles can't
      be disarmed.</p>
