      <p>By performing part of the Chelish opera <i>Victory of the
      Hellknights</i>, you call forth spectral illusions of mounted Hellknights
      to trample your foes under the hooves of their glorious steeds. The
      shadowy knights appear in an adjacent 10-foot square and ride forward in
      the direction you indicate, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level
      (maximum 20d6) to all creatures in their path. Half of this damage is cold
      damage, while half results directly from arcane power and is not subject
      to cold resistance or immunity. The knights cannot pass through force
      effects or barriers that block incorporeal creatures or undead. I</p>
