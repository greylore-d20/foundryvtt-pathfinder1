      metal canister  releases a cloud of toxic gas. It is usually placed on
      the  ground and triggered so that the wind blows the gas toward  enemy
      positions. Normally, multiple gas cylinders are  placed in line and
      triggered together to cover a wider area  of the battlefield. First,
      determine what direction the wind  is blowing by rolling 1d4 (1 is north,
      2 is east, 3 is south,  and 4 is west). When triggered, a gas cylinder
      releases a  cloud of mustard gas (see the sidebar on page 67) in a 15- 
      foot cone. On the following 2 rounds, the cloud extends  by an additional
      15-foot square away from the canister,  forming a 15-foot-wide,
      45-foot-long cloud at the end of  3 rounds. The cloud moves with the wind,
      rolling along  the surface of the ground, and disperses after 10 rounds.
      A  strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and  a severe
      wind (31+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.</p>
