      <p>This fine gray powder causes targets to suffer from uncontrollable
      itching until they spend at least 1 round washing it off. Throwing a
      packet of itching powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 10
      feet. Anyone standing on the square of impact must succeed on a DC 12
      <em>Fortitude</em> save to resist the powder, while those in adjacent
      squares must make a DC 8 <em>Fortitude</em> save. Creatures that fail the
      save take a -2 penalty on <em>attack rolls</em>, <em>saving throws</em>,
      skill checks, and ability checks.</p>

      <p>Itching powder can make an otherwise innocuous spell especially
      irritating.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><em>Glitterdust</em> (M): For each packet of itching powder used as a
      power component, you may designate one creature in the area to be affected
      by itching powder (DC 12).</li>

      <li><em>Repel Vermin</em> (M): The first <em>vermin</em> that enters the
      emanation is subject to the effects of itching powder (DC 15). Each packet
      of itching powder beyond the first means the spell affects another
      <em>vermin</em> that enters the emanation. A <em>swarm</em> of
      <em>vermin</em> counts as one <em>vermin</em> for the purpose of this
      effect.</li>

      <li><em>Summon Swarm</em> (M): Increase the <em>swarm's</em> distraction
      DC by 2.</li>
