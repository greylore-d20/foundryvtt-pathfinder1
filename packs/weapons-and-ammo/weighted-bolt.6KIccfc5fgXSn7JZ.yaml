    value: >-
      <p>This barbed ballista bolt is equipped with a heavy weight at the end of
      a long chain. The bolt's extra weight makes the bolt harder to fire
      accurately, and imposes a -2 penalty on attack rolls.</p>

      <p>In addition to the normal damage dealt by a ballista bolt of its size,
      on a successful hit the weighted bolt lodges itself into the target's
      body, leaving the weighted chain hanging loosely, imparting a -5 penalty
      on all Fly checks made by the target.</p>

      <p>These penalties stack if a target is hit with multiple weighted bolts.
      A weighted bolt can be removed with a successful DC 25 Heal check or a DC
      20 Strength check.</p>
