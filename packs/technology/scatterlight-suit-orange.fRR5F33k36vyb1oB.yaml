      scatterlight suit is a tight, form-fitting suit of highly reflective
      polymers and synthetic metal fibers. It's designed to reflect beam weapon
      attacks, and provides only minimal protection against physical damage.
      Activating a scatterlight suit is a standard action; once activated, the
      suit diffuses and blurs light reflected from its surface, making the
      wearer appear hazy and indistinct. While active, a scatterlight suit
      increases the wearer's touch AC by a variable amount-this bonus is an
      armor bonus, but does not increase the wearer's normal or flatfooted AC
      beyond the scatterlight suit's baseline armor bonus of +1. This bonus to
      touch AC only applies to attacks made by beam weapons and rays-it does not
      provide additional protection to other touch
      attacks.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 31;
