  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can create a quasi-real simple or martial masterwork weapon
      appropriate for your current size. You are considered proficient with this
      weapon. The first time you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature
      can attempt a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals
      damage normally, while success means the creature takes only 1 point of
      damage from the weapon’s attacks. The weapon deals only 1 point of damage
      to objects.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, and again at 11th level and 19th level, the weapon gains
      a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, the weapon gains either the frost or keen weapon special
      ability, chosen when the weapon is created. These abilities don’t function
      against a target that succeeds at its Will save.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, the weapon deals minimum damage (as if it had rolled a 1
      on each of its damage dice) against targets that succeed at their saves
      instead of 1 point of damage.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your
      oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must
      be used in 1-minute increments. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it
      leaves your grasp.</p>
