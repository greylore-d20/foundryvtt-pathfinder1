      <p>In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing
      various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves
      to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist
      can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his
      <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the
      round they are created, they degrade and become inert—their method of
      creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created
      and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial
      containing an ounce of liquid catalyst—the alchemist can create this
      liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and
      these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a
      spellcaster’s component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst
      vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can
      create in that day—once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the
      alchemist for years.</p>

      <p>Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a
      <em>standard action</em> that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown
      bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the <em>Throw Splash Weapon</em>
      special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using
      feats such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.8rsFtye3PwM6CKli]{Point-Blank Shot}
      and @Compendium[pf1.feats.n250dFlbykAIAg5Z]{Weapon Focus}. On a direct
      hit, an alchemist’s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional
      damage equal to the alchemist’s <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. The damage
      of an alchemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered
      alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or
      by using feats such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital
      Strike}). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the
      bomb’s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire
      damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire
      damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a <em>Reflex</em>
      save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
      alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>

      <p>Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the
      <em>Discovery</em> ability) as they level up. An alchemist’s bomb, like an
      extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p>
