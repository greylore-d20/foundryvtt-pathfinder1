  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You are able to tweak tiny variables affecting a creature's immediate
    future in order to grant the target a Bit of Luck at the right time. Roll a
    d20; once during the duration of <i>lucky number</i>, when the target
    creature rolls that result (regardless of what type of dice the target
    rolls), the creature has the option to either reroll the result or add a +2
    luck bonus to the result. The creature must decide to use this ability
    before the success or failure of the original roll is known. A creature can
    have only one <i>lucky number</i> at a time. If <i>lucky number</i> is cast
    on a creature already affected by that spell, the new number replaces the
    previous one.</p>
