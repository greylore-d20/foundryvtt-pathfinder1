In addition, she can spend 2 points from her ki pool as a swift action to gain the skill unlocks (Pathfinder Unchained 82) for one skill of her choice as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. This benefit lasts for 1 minute. The rogue must have a ki pool before selecting this advanced talent.</p>"
