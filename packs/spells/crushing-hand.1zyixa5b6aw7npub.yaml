  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>interposing hand</i>, except that it can also
    grapple one opponent as <i>grasping hand</i>. Its CMB and CMD for grapple
    checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12
    bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its
    Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A <i>crushing hand</i> deals
    2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an
    opponent. The <i>crushing hand</i> can instead be directed to bull rush a
    target (as <i>forceful hand</i>), using the same bonuses outlined above, or
    it can be directed to interpose itself, as <i>interposing hand</i> does.</p>
