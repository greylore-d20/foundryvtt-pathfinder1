      "value": "<p>The barbarian selects one elemental type (air, earth, fire, or water). Once selected, this choice cannot be changed. While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against spells with the selected elemental descriptor. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. The barbarian gains access to the elemental totem rage power matching the element she selected. To select a standard elemental totem power, the barbarian must be at least 6th level and must have selected the appropriate element when she gained the lesser elemental totem rage power. In order to gain the greater elemental totem power, she must be 10th level and have already selected the standard elemental totem of that type.</p>\n<p>A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers (for example, a barbarian that selects the air totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the fire totem rage powers).</p>"
