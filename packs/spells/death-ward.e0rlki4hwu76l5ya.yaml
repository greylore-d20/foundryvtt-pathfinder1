  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells and
    magical death effects. The subject is granted a save to negate such effects
    even if one is not normally allowed. The subject is immune to energy drain
    and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative
    energy.</p><p>This spell does not remove negative levels that the subject
    has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from negative levels
    for the duration of its effect.</p><p><i>Death ward</i> does not protect
    against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.</p>
