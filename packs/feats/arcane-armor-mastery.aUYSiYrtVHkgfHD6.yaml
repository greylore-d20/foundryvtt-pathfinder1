  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>You have mastered the ability to cast spells while wearing
      armor.</em><p><b>Prerequisites</b><br>Arcane Armor Training, Medium Armor
      Proficiency, caster level 7th.<p><b>Benefits</b><br>As a swift action,
      reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to the armor you are wearing by
      20% for any spells you cast this round. This bonus replaces, and does not
      stack with, the bonus granted by Arcane Armor Training.<p><b>Combat
      Trick</b><br>When casting a spell while wearing armor, you can spend 1
      stamina point to activate Arcane Armor Mastery as a free action, or spend
      a number of stamina points equal to the spell's level (minimum 1) to
      ignore your armor's arcane spell failure chance entirely for that
      casting.</p>
