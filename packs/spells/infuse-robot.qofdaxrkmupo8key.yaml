      <p>If the targeted robot fails its Will saving throw, it transforms into a
      magical construct made of wood, stone, flesh, or bone. The robot's
      statistics and abilities do not change, although it is now a magical
      construct rather than a technological one. It loses the robot subtype, but
      does not lose its Intelligence score (if any). You can issue mental
      commands to the infused robot as long as it stays within range of the
      spell; issuing commands in this manner is a free action for you. When the
      spell's duration runs out, the robot transforms back to normal but is
      staggered for 1d4 rounds.</p>
