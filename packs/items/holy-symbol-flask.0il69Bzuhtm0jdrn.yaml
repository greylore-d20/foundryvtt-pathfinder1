      <p><strong>Price</strong> +10 gp</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This version of
      a standard holy symbol is oversized and has a watertight compartment that
      can hold 1 pint (the same volume as a flask of holy water). Adventurers
      normally use the compartment to hold holy water or alcohol. A holy symbol
      flask is not meant for you to throw at enemies and is not fragile like a
      flask or vial. Like using holy water on incorporeal opponent, you
      unstopper the flask and pour the contents onto an adjacent target.
      Detecting the compartment requires a successful DC 10 Perception
      check.</p>
