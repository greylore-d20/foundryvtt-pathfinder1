  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Alchemists with this discovery can prepare special rockets to deliver
      their bombs. Rocket bombs travel farther and explode bigger than normal
      bombs, but cannot target individual creatures. Rocket bombs explode in a
      20-foot radius, and all creatures in that area take the alchemistâ€™s normal
      splash damage. The range increment on a rocket bomb is 50 feet. Rocket
      bombs cannot be used with the precise bomb or fast bomb discoveries.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
