  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can touch any one ranged weapon and enhance it with
      the quality of air. For 1 minute, any attacks made with the weapon take no
      penalties due to range. In addition, making a ranged attack with this
      weapon doesnâ€™t provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
