  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon casting this spell, all recipients gain the ability to speak a new
      language. This language sounds like random, babbling syllables to anyone
      not under the influence of the spell, but the targets understand each
      other perfectly.  Anyone using <i>codespeak</i> can read and write in this
      new language as well. Once the spell expires, however, any coded writing
      suddenly appears as gibberish. If the exact same group of individuals
      become the targets of a <i>codespeak</i> spell again, cast by the same
      caster, they can once again read any coded writings. A dedicated
      codebreaker can crack such writing's code, deciphering it one page at a
      time with a series of DC 30 Linguistics checks. <i>Comprehend
      languages</i> doesn't enable a caster to understand the language of
      another's <i>codespeak</i> spell, but it does reveal that the targets are
      speaking a magical language. <i>Tongues</i> translates <i>codespeak</i>
      normally.</p>
