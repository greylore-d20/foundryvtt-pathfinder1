      "value": "<p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b> No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>The Positive Energy Plane is a font of growth, life, and souls, and metaphysical currents bear these resources through the hearts of stars and onto the Material Plane. Especially potent bursts of positive energy or partially developed souls can wind their way through the Material Plane to quicken plant life in particular. Only hardy plant creatures can foster this extraplanar force and be transformed into fonts of unchecked growth. Such rampant creatures rapidly change their local environments, turning mundane plants into tangled masses of competing foliage that slowly develop into new creatures all their own.<p>“Rampant” is an acquired template that can be added to any plant creature with at least 8 Hit Dice, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A rampant creature uses the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> The base creature’s CR + 1.<p><b>Aura:</b> A rampant creature has the following aura.<p><em>Aura of Growth (Su): </em>Living plants (but not plant creatures) within 1 mile of a rampant creature grow at triple their normal rate, and plants within 100 feet are affected as by the overgrowth function of <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=plant%20growth\">plant growth</a>. Overgrown plants return to normal after spending 1 hour outside the rampant creature’s presence, or immediately if the rampant creature takes negative energy damage.<p><b>Regeneration:</b> A rampant creature gains regeneration 5 (negative energy).<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> A rampant creature gains vulnerability to negative energy, and taking any negative energy damage disables the creature’s aura of growth for 1 minute.<p><b>Abilities:</b> Con +4.<p><b>Special Quality:</b> A rampant creatures gain the following special quality.<p><em>Verdant Genesis (Su): </em>Every week, a group of living plants within 1 mile of the rampant creature grows into new plant creatures with total combined Hit Dice no higher than the rampant creature’s total Hit Dice. For instance, a rampant <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Quickwood\">quickwood</a> with 10 HD could create two 4 HD <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Assassin%20Vine\">assassin vines</a> and two 1 HD <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vegepygmy\">vegepygmies</a>. These new creatures are not under the rampant creature’s command. These new creatures each take 1 permanent negative level for each full day they spend more than 1 mile from the rampant creature that spawned them. A rampant creature cannot suppress its verdant genesis ability.</p>"
