    value: >-
      <p>The target firearm suddenly fires of its own volition, even if it is
      unloaded, generating a recoil so great that the wielder or carrier of the
      firearm must scramble to hold onto it and becomes flat-footed until the
      start of his next turn. If the wielder is already flat-footed, he is
      instead knocked prone. If the firearm was loaded, that ammunition is
      wasted.</p>
