The vigilante ignores limitations and penalties on ranged attacks, including thrown weapons, imposed by being underwater for the first 15 feet. (See Underwater Combat on page 432 of the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook&nbsp;for more information.)</p>\n<p>A vigilante must be at least 8th level to select this talent.</p>"
