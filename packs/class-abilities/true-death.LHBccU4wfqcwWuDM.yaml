  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Those slain by your spells or by one of your attacks that deals
      negative energy becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead.
      Spellcasters attempting to bring such a creature back from the dead using
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.c5anior2ysy6s2xy]{Raise Dead} or similar magic must
      succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + your oracle level
      or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. A successful
      casting of @Compendium[pf1.spells.o87h8gjxevcbztgd]{Remove Curse} (DC = 10
      + your oracle level) before attempting to bring the creature back from the
      dead suppresses this effect for 1 minute.</p>
