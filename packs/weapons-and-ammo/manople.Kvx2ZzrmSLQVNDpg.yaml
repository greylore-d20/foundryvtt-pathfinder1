  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This rigid, fingerless gauntlet has three blades projecting from the
      gauntlet's hand. The central blade is straight and double edged, while the
      side blades are curved like the prongs of a sai. You can't use the hand on
      which a manople is worn for anything else. A manople takes a full-round
      action to don, and gives you a +10 bonus to your CMD against disarm
      attempts.</p>
