      <p>This vibrant yellow and pale-green variety of seaweed has wide fronds
      with lines of narrow fringe along the upper edge.</p>

      <p><b>Gather</b> DC 25; <b>Yield</b> 1 dose</p>

      <p><b>Terrain</b> any underwater</p>

      <p><b>Preparation</b> A single dose of <em>merfolk's</em> comb must be
      allowed to dry over a period of 7 days while being rubbed with alchemical
      oils once daily to prevent the herb from losing its properties during the
      process. This requires seven separate successful DC 14 <em>Craft</em>
      (alchemy) checks, one every 24 hours during this week. If even one of
      those checks is a failure, the dose of <em>merfolk's</em> comb is
      ruined.</p>

      <p><b>Use</b> Anyone who eats a dose of <em>merfolk's</em> comb gains the
      ability to breathe water as well as air for 8 hours.</p>
