  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of hatred for a number of
      rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds need not be
      consecutive. Enemies within this aura must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 +
      1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier). Characters who fail their
      save are filled with hatred, and cannot consider other characters allies
      for the purpose of any actions or use any teamwork feats. The effect ends
      immediately if the creature leaves the aura, you end the aura as a free
      action, or you expend all rounds of this ability.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Destructive Aura power of the Destruction
      Domain.</p>
