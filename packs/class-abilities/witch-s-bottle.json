Any creature that consumes this potion is affected by the hex as if cast by its creator. The witch canâ€™t use that hex until the potion is consumed or rendered inert.</p>\n<p>Only hexes that can target a creature other than the witch can be distilled in this way. The potion remains potent until consumed or rendered inert by the witch as a free action.</p>\n<p>A witch must have the cauldron hex to select this hex.</p>"
