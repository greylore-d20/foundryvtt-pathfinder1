  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A grappling hook is usually thought of as a climbing instrument, but is
      also used to grapple enemy ships and draw them close before a boarding
      action.</p><p>Grappling hooks bite deeply into the wood of the railing. It
      takes 1 minute to pry a grappling hook free. The rope attached to a
      grappling hook can be cut, but pirates often target the rigging and masts
      to make it difficult to remove the hooks. Tying off the rope of a
      grappling hook is a move action.</p><p>A grappling hook can also be used
      as a ranged weapon. If you are proficient in the grappling hook, it is a
      grappling weapon. On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type,
      you can grapple the target of the attack. You can attempt a combat
      maneuver check to grapple your opponent as a free action. This grapple
      attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you
      are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you. While
      you grapple the target with a grappling weapon, you can only move or
      damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered grappled,
      though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the
      grapple. If you move far enough away to be out of the weapon's reach, the
      grapple ends.</p><p>A grappling hook's weight includes the weight of 50
      feet of hemp rope. It can be reduced by using shorter or lighter rope.</p>
