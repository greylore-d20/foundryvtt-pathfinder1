  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can avoid being <i>detect</i>ed when you are on the edges of some
      divination spells' ranges. Whenever you would normally be within the area
      of effect of a <i>detect</i>ion spell (such as <i>detect magic</i>,
      <i>detect evil</i>, or <i>detect</i> undead), the area of effect is
      reduced by half for the purposes of the spell's caster <i>detect</i>ing
      you or your possessions. The caster of the <i>detect</i> spell is unaware
      of this reduction in her spell's range; she simply does not <i>detect</i>
      you.</p>
