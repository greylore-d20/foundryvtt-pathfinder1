  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can apply any one <em>metamagic feat</em> that you
      know to a spell you are about to cast. This does not alter the level of
      the spell or the casting time. You can use this ability once per day at
      8th level and one additional time per day for every two wizard levels you
      possess beyond 8th. Any time you use this ability to apply a metamagic
      feat that increases the spell level by more than 1, you must use an
      additional daily usage for each level above 1 that the feat adds to the
      spell. Even though this ability does not modify the spellâ€™s actual level,
      you cannot use this ability to cast a spell whose modified spell level
      would be above the level of the highest-level spell that you are capable
      of casting.</p>
