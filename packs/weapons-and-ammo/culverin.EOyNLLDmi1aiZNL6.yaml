      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><b>Damage</b> 2d6 (small), 2d8 (medium);
      <b>Critical</b> x4; <b>Range</b> 30 ft.; <b>Type</b> B and P</p>

      <p><b>Misfire</b> 1 (10 ft.); <b>Capacity</b> 1</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>The culverin, also known as a hand bombard, consists of a simple
      smoothbore tube, sealed at one end except for a small hole used to ignite
      a gunpowder charge. A wooden stock partially encases the barrel, allowing
      you to hold it under your arm with relative ease when carrying it. Firing
      a culverin without support (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imposes
      a -4 penalty on attack rolls, and knocks you prone.</p>

      <p>A culverin uses 4 doses of black powder and grapeshot (a handful of
      pellets) as ammunition. Note that these statistics simulate only the
      original, hand-held culverins-their larger descendants are considered
      cannons and are dealt with in the siege weapon section of <em>Ultimate
      Combat</em>.</p>
