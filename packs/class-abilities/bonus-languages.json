These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.<br><br>A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1stlevel shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters.</p>"
