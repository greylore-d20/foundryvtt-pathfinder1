  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, the cavalier can strike out at those who mean his ward
      harm. Whenever a creature attacks the cavalierâ€™s ward, or attempts to
      steal, sunder, or otherwise wrest control of it from the cavalier or his
      allies, the attacking creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the
      cavalier. The cavalier receives a +2 bonus on attacks of opportunity he
      makes against such creatures.</p>
