  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You place a willing subject into a cataleptic state. It remains aware
      of its surroundings but is paralyzed, appearing dead unless observers make
      a DC 20 Heal check. <i>Hibernate</i> delays the effects of poison,
      disease, and bleed effects for the spell's duration, and half of any hit
      point damage suffered by the subject is converted to nonlethal
      damage.</p><p>This spell originated with the Green Faith, but has spread
      to all other druidic religions.</p>
