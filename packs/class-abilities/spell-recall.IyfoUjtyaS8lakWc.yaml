  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells
      he has already cast. With a swift action he can recall any single magus
      spell that he has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number
      of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). The
      spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.</p>
