      "value": "<p>A bard of 6th level or higher can use his performance to make a @Compendium[pf1.spells.zqj5qzyl46af27v0]{Suggestion} (as per the spell) to a creature that he has already <em>fascinated</em> (see above). Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require a <em>standard action</em> to activate (in addition to the <em>free action</em> to continue the fascinate effect). A bard can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance.</p>\n<p>A <em>Will</em> saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard’s level + bard’s <em>Cha</em> modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see @Compendium[pf1.spells.52v3fogun1n9jzum]{Suggestion, Mass}, below). Suggestion is an <em>enchantment</em> (<em>compulsion</em>), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.</p>"
