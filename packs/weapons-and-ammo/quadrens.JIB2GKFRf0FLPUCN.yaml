  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A quadrens looks similar to a sturdy dagger, but with four spikes
      mounted in a square pattern in place of a blade. When you score a critical
      hit with a quadrens, the resulting gaping wound causes 1 point of bleed
      damage. In addition to punching through hide and armor, the spikes can
      also be used to snag opponents' blades and twist them out of their
      grips.</p>
