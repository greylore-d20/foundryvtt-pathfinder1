    value: >-
      <p>You create a spectral choir and conduct its tortured, ghostly moans,
      deluding listeners into believing they are suffering the torments of the
      dead.</p><p>The transparent singers occupy a 10-foot cube, but they are
      intangible and do not interfere with creatures in any physical way, nor
      can they be attacked.</p><p>Creatures within 30 feet of the choir
      experience wracking pain that causes them to take a -2 penalty on attack
      rolls, skill checks, and ability checks.</p><p>Individuals who exit the
      area of effect take these penalties for an additional 2 rounds before the
      delusion wears off.</p>
