  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon- an axe head and a spear point on
      opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon
      that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that
      deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon;
      the other becomes the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a
      charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals
      damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.</p>
