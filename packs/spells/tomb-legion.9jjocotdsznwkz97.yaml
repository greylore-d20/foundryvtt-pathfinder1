      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.bp4s030vn5iwwf58]{shambler}, except that
      it calls into existence [[/r 1d4+2]] advanced mummies rather than
      shambling mounds.</p><p>Though the spell has fallen out of favor among the
      Risen Guard because the Ruby Prince frowns on the use of undead, this
      spell is popular among followers of the Whispering Way.</p>
