    value: >-
      <p>As a full-round action while raging, the barbarian can lift and hurl an
      object up to one size category smaller than herself with both hands or two
      size categories smaller with one hand as an improvised weapon with a range
      increment of 10 feet. This inflicts damage as a <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Falling%20Objects&amp;Category=Environmental%20Rules">falling
      object</a> plus the barbarian’s Strength bonus. This damage is halved if
      the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. This is a
      ranged touch attack, and the target may attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2
      the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Strength modifier) for half
      damage. The barbarian may apply
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.FUW5mIXHNBBIQ1Sq]{Power Attack} to this attack as a
      one- or two-handed weapon, as appropriate.</p><hr
      /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: Add damage formula according to object
      size.</p>
