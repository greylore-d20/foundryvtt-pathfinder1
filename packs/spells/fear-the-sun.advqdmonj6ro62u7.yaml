      <p>Each target that fails its saving throw gains light blindness, as per
      the universal monster rule. When exposed to bright light, affected targets
      are blinded for 1 full round and are dazzled in successive  rounds. If you
      cast this spell in the presence of bright light, any target that fails its
      save is blinded immediately, and dazzled starting at the beginning of its
      first turn.</p>
