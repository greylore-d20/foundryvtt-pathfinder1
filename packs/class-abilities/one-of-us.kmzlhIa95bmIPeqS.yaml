  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, your form begins to rot (the appearance of this decay is
      up to you) and undead see you as one of them. You gain immunity to cold,
      nonlethal damage, paralysis, and sleep. You also gain <em>DR</em> 5/â€”.
      Unintelligent undead do not notice you unless you attack them. You receive
      a +4 morale bonus on <em>saving throws</em> made against spells and
      spell-like abilities cast by undead.</p>
