    value: >-
      <p>These long-reaching extenders can be attached to or detached from
      thieves' tools as a <em>standard action</em>, allowing the user to make
      <em>Disable Device</em> checks on devices in any space he could reach with
      a reach weapon. High-quality mirrors on the shafts let him see what he's
      doing, but he takes a -4 penalty on <em>Disable Device</em> checks when
      working on a device more than 5 feet away.</p>

      <p>Common (70 gp; 3 lbs.), Mithral (820 gp; 1-1/2 lbs.)</p>
