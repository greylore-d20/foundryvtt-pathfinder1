      weighted striking end connected to a handle by a sturdy chain. Though
      often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like the head of a morningstar,
      the head of a light flail can actually take many different shapes, such as
      short bars. Military flails are sturdier evolutions of agricultural
      flails, which are used for threshing-beating stacks of grains to separate
      the useful grains from their husks.</p>
