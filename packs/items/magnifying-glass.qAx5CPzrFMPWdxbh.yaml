    value: >-
      <p>This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also
      useful as a substitute for a flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting
      a fire with a magnifying glass requires bright light, such as sunlight to
      focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a fullround action. A magnifying
      glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item
      that is small or highly detailed. </p>
