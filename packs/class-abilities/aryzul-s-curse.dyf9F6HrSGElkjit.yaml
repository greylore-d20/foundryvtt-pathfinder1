  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When raging, the barbarian emanates a 5-foot-radius aura of
      radioactivity. Each round that another creature begins its turn within
      this aura, it takes a cumulative –2 penalty to Strength (Fortitude
      negates, DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + her Constitution modifier)
      for the duration of the rage. A creature’s Strength penalty from this
      ability cannot exceed the barbarian’s class level. At 12th level, the
      barbarian can choose to create a 10-foot-radius aura of radioactivity when
      she begins her rage.</p>
