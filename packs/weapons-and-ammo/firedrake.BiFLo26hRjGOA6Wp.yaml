      large siege engines are typically wheeled or attached to vehicles that can
      transport them to the battlefield. This apparatus fires gouts of
      alchemist's fire in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone (siege crew
      leader's choice). Targets in the area take 6d6 points of fire damage (DC
      15 Reflex save halves); those who fail their saves also catch on
      fire.</p><p>A firedrake with the broken condition that suffers a further
      mishap explodes, dealing its damage to all creatures within a 20-foot
      blast (DC 15 Reflex save halves).</p><p>One use of firedrake ammunition
      costs 200 gp and weighs 20 pounds.</p>
