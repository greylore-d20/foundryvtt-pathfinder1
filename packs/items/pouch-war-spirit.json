By crushing the pouch as a <em>standard action</em>, an <em>orc</em> (or a creature from a suitably warlike culture) gains 1d4+1 <em>temporary hit points</em>. These <em>temporary hit points</em> go away after 10 minutes. A creature can only benefit from 1 spirit pouch at a time. Once used, the spirit pouch is destroyed.</p> \n"
