      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.3w1ozzzf8hk0gdzm]{reincarnate} except
      that you can cause the new body to resemble a particular creature,
      matching its age category and sex and rerolling any race result that would
      be the wrong size category. The subject further gains a +5 bonus on
      Disguise checks to impersonate the chosen creature due to similar
      features, although it might take a penalty for being the wrong race. The
      spell automatically leaves you with a small piece of the creature's new
      body, typically a lock of hair (useful for <em>scrying</em> and other such
      spells).</p>
