    <p>You make the affected subjects ready for battle despite their fear. If a
    target is suffering from a fear effect of any kind, he gains a +2 morale
    bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a
    -2 penalty to AC.</p><p>If the subject is frightened, he remains in place
    and gains the confused condition for the remainder of the fear effect,
    except he treats all results of "attack self " as "do nothing" and treats
    "attack nearest creature" as "act normally." If the subject is panicked, he
    remains in place and gains the confused condition for the duration of the
    fear effect.</p>
