  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, you may designate a person or object as your focus. This
      takes 1 minute of concentration, during which time you must either picture
      this item or person if familiar to you, or meditate on the item’s or
      person’s description if not. Until you choose a new focus, you gain a
      bonus equal to half your inquisitor level on Perception checks to see or
      hear your focus, or when using Survival to track your focus or a creature
      with your focus in its possession. This bonus stacks with that gained from
      the track special ability.</p>
