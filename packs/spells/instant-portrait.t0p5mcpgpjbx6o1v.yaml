  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You touch a surface and produce a painted portrait of either yourself
      or a creature you can see without needing to attempt a Craft (painting)
      check. The surface to be affected must be relatively flat, such as a piece
      of paper or a wall. The image can be any color of your choice, but is
      monochromatic. While it is of too poor a quality to sell, it is otherwise
      accurate enough to recognize the subject or to serve as a target for the
      <i>enter image</i> spell. The portrait reflects your perception of the
      creature depicted, including any disguises, magical or mundane, that the
      subject is wearing at the time of the painting's creation. The portrait is
      only as durable as normal paint and can be removed by mundane means.</p>
