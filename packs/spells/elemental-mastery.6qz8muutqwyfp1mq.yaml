  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You gain mastery over the element matching the elemental essence in your
    blood (fire for ifrits, earth for oreads, air for sylphs, and water for
    undines). If you are a suli, you can choose any one of the four options as
    you cast this spell, but the duration is reduced to 1 round per level. Your
    mastery gives you an insight bonus to your speed or a new movement mode,
    depending on the element you master, and grants one additional benefit. This
    spell's descriptor matches the chosen element. <table border
