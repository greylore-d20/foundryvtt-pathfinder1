    value: >-
      <p>By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from
      its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type.
      For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison
      (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy
      lab.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
