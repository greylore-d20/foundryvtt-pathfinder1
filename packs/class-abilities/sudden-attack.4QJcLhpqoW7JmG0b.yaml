  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you take a full-attack action, you gain one additional attack
      at your highest base attack bonus. This ability stacks with the extra
      attack from haste, but it doesnâ€™t stack with special actions that grant
      extra attacks, such as flurry of blows or spell combat. Sudden attack
      works as normal with full-attack options such as two-weapon fighting.</p>
