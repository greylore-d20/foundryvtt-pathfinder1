There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Entangling Shot Cartridge</em>:</strong> (<strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</em>) This mix of black powder and an alchemically treated resin strong enough to survive the shot can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or another scatter weapon. It deals half damage to those hit by a cone attack made with this weapon, but any creature hit by the shot must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or become entangled for 2d4 rounds. An entangling shot cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
