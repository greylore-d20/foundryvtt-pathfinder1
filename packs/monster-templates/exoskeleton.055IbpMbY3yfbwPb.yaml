      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Found skittering through forgotten
      tombs, crawling through deep forests, and filling damp caverns,
      exoskeletons are animated carapaces of arthropods and other vermin. Most
      exoskeletons are the intentional creations of necromancers, but some of
      these undead monstrosities arise spontaneously from places awash with
      negative energy or are created by malfunctioning artifacts. Sometimes, the
      simple act of feeding on freshly destroyed undead creatures is enough to
      transform an insect into an exoskeleton upon its eventual death. Though
      exoskeletons are just as mindless as they were when they were living, they
      have become infused with an evil instinct in their new unlife that drives
      them to relentlessly attack all living creatures on sight, exploding in a
      burst of dusty remains when destroyed.<p>A spellcaster can create an
      exoskeleton using <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=animate%20dead">animate
      dead</a>. An exoskeleton can be created from a mostly intact dead vermin
      that has an exoskeleton. This includes arachnids, crustaceans, insects,
      and even some mollusks, but not soft-bodied vermin such as jellyfish and
      leeches.<p>“Exoskeleton” is an acquired template that can be added to any
      corporeal vermin that has an exoskeleton (referred to hereafter as the
      base creature).<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Depends on Hit Dice, as
      follows.</p>

      base creature had, and gains a number of additional Hit Dice as noted on

      can’t be made into an exoskeleton by the <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=animate%20dead">animate
      dead</a> spell. An exoskeleton uses its Charisma modifier (instead of its

      <p><br><b>Saves:</b> Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 Hit Dice, Ref +1/3
      Hit Dice, and Will +1/2 Hit Dice + 2.<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b>
      Exoskeletons lose their defensive abilities and gain all of the qualities
      and immunities granted by the undead type. In addition, exoskeletons gain
      DR 5/bludgeoning.<p><b>Speed:</b> Exoskeletons retain all movement speeds.
      They can still fly but their maneuverability drops to
      clumsy.<p><b>Attacks:</b> An exoskeleton retains all of its natural
      weapons. If the base creature didn’t have any natural weapons, it gains a
      slam attack that deals damage as if it were one size category larger than
      its actual size.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> An exoskeleton loses all of its
      special attacks that rely on a living biology (such as poison), but it
      retains any others.<p><b>Abilities:</b> An exoskeleton’s Strength
      increases by 2. The exoskeleton has no Constitution or Intelligence score,
      and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10.<p><b>BAB:</b> An
      exoskeleton’s base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit
      Dice.<p><b>Skills:</b> Though most vermin are mindless and have no skill
      ranks, the exoskeleton loses all skill ranks if it had any, and it doesn’t
      retain any racial bonuses it had.<p><b>Feats:</b> An exoskeleton loses all
      feats that the base creature had and doesn’t gain feats as its Hit Dice
      increase, but it does gain <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Toughness">Toughness</a>
      as a bonus feat.<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> An exoskeleton loses most
      special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary
      special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. An exoskeleton
      gains the following special quality.<p><em>Burst (Ex): </em>When an
      exoskeleton is destroyed, its desiccated husk bursts, releasing the dusty
      remains of the vermin’s insides into the surrounding air. Any creature
      adjacent to an exoskeleton when it bursts must succeed at a Fortitude save
      or become staggered for 1 round as it coughs and sneezes. Creatures that
      don’t need to breathe are immune to this effect. If the exoskeleton has 10
      or more Hit Dice, the victim is instead nauseated for 1 round. The save DC
      is equal to 10 + half the exoskeleton’s Hit Dice + its Charisma
      modifier.</p>
