    value: >-
      <p>This enchantment causes a creature to be unable to speak intelligibly.
      Any effort the target makes to talk, in any language, comes out as a
      useless mix of unconnected words and noises. Even magic words are affected
      to some extent; the target has a 20% spell failure chance for any spell it
      attempts to cast with verbal components, and a 20% chance to incorrectly
      use a command word to activate a magic item.</p><p>This spell has no
      effect on telepathic communication, or the vocalizations of creatures that
      lack a spoken language.</p>
