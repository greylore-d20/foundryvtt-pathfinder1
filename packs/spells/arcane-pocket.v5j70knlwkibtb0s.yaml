  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With a touch, you conjure an extradimensional space inside a pouch or
      pocket. The pocket acts as a <i>bag of holding</i>, except it can hold
      only 10 pounds per caster level. Regardless of what is placed into the
      pocket, it weighs 3 pounds. Unlike a <i>bag of holding</i>, the pocket
      created by this ability cannot be overloaded or ruptured-any additional
      material simply spills out of the top-nor does it have any special
      interaction with other kinds of extradimensional spaces.  An <i>arcane
      pocket</i> grants you a +1 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal its
      contents. The pocket becomes nonmagical, spilling all of its contents onto
      the ground unharmed, if it leaves your possession or you create a new
      <i>arcane pocket</i>.</p>
