    value: >-
      <p>You impart your knowledge of nobility and peerage to the target,
      allowing her to recognize members of noble households, differentiate one
      set of heraldry from another, and otherwise identify who's who at a royal
      gala or other noteworthy social event. The target is able to identify
      noble individuals, noble family names, and noble crests, signets,
      heraldry, and other symbols. The target treats her number of ranks in
      Knowledge (nobility) as though it were equal to your number of ranks in
      Knowledge (nobility), to a maximum of 5 ranks and a minimum of 0. If the
      target's number of ranks is greater than yours, she uses her own number of
      ranks instead. In addition, if the target's new total skill bonus on
      Knowledge (nobility) checks is at least +0, she automatically succeeds on
      all Knowledge (nobility) checks with a DC of 10 or lower.</p>
