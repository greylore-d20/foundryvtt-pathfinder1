  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that
    originates from you, affecting all creatures in the burst.</p>

    <p>A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled
    1d4×10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a
    Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6×10 feet and takes 2d6 points of
    nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.</p>

    <p>Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying
    are blown back 1d6×10 feet.</p>

    <p>Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the
    wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6×5 feet.</p>

    <p>Large or larger creatures may move normally within a hurricane blast
    effect.<br></p>

    <p><em>Hurricane blast</em> can't move a creature beyond the limit of its
    range. Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged
    attacks and Listen checks in the area of a <em>hurricane blast</em>. The
    force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar
    unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns,
    to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.</p>

    <p>In addition to the effects noted, a hurricane blast can do anything that
    a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging
    spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or
    hangings, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.</p>
