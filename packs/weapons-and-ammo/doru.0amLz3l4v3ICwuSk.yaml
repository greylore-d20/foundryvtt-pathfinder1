  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Balanced by a metal butt, this large spear is weighted so that it can
      be used in one hand by a proficient wielder. You can use a doru two-handed
      as a simple weapon. You can also use a doru as a onehanded martial weapon,
      but its critical hit multiplier decreases to x2.</p>
