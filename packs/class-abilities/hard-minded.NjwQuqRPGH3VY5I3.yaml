  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent is hard to fool with illusions. She
      automatically receives a save to disbelieve any illusion she can see each
      round at the start of her turn, even if she hasnâ€™t interacted with it. If
      she fails a saving throw against an illusion that is not to disbelieve,
      she can attempt to save again again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets
      only one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw.</p>
