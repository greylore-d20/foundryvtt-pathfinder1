If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed.</p><p>Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.</p>",
