    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can choose to take the
      form of your chosen dragon type (as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.5icj4nasrlgqojqm]{Form of the Dragon II}, but with
      average or good maneuverability, as you would gain from the dragon wings
      bloodrage power above).</p>
