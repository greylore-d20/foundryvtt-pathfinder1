  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You badger and nitpick the subject of your spell until its mood sours.
    The target's attitude shifts one category toward hostile regarding you and
    everyone within 30 feet of the target at the time the spell is cast. The
    target also takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws, and on
    ability and skill checks that rely on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>
