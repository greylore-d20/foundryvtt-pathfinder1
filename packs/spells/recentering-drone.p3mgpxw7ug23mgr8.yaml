      <p>You emit a calming subsonic drone that allows the targets to
      temporarily refocus and restore their balance when they're suffering from
      debilitating conditions. A target with the dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or
      sickened condition ignores the penalties of those conditions for the
      duration of this spell. A target with one of the following conditions is
      treated as having the associated lesser condition for the duration of the
      spell, as shown by the following table.</p><p></p><table
      border="1"><tbody><tr><th>Condition</th><th>Lesser
      Condition</th></tr><tr><td>Blinded</td><td>Dazzled</td></tr><tr><td>Exhausted</td><td>Fatigued</td></tr><tr><td>Frightened</td><td>Shaken</td></tr><tr><td>Nauseated</td><td>Sickened</td></tr></tbody></table>
      At the end of the spell's duration, the targets are again subject to the
      appropriate penalties if the original conditions affecting the target are
      still in effect.<p></p>
