  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Combining your mastery of earth and water, you shape the battlefield in
      your favor, bending the terrain to benefit you and your allies and hinder
      any who might oppose you. The ground within 5 feet per 2 oracle levels you
      have shifts and rolls unpredictably; if you use this ability underwater,
      the surrounding waters churn. This area moves with you, and you and your
      allies are unaffected by the roiling terrain. Other creatures can move
      within the area at half speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check.
      Failure means they stop moving for the round, while failure by 5 or more
      causes them to fall prone; if underwater, creatures gain the effects of
      being off-balance (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 433) instead of falling
      prone.</p><p>This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your oracle
      level, and you can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Charisma modifier.</p>
