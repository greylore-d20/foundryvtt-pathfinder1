  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, choose an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that
      is opposite to one axis of your own. Once chosen, this cannot be changed.
      Add your Wisdom bonus on caster level checks to overcome the spell
      resistance of creatures with the chosen alignment subtype; dispel effects
      with the chosen alignment descriptor; and remove curses, diseases, and
      poisons. A neutral inquisitor gains only the bonus on caster level checks
      to remove curses, diseases, and poisons.</p>
