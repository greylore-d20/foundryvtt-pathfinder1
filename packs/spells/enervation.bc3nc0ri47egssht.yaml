  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that
      suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make
      a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary
      negative levels (see Appendix 1). Negative levels stack.</p><p>Assuming
      the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal
      to your caster level (maximum 15 hours).</p><p>Usually, negative levels
      have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from
      <i>enervation</i> don't last long enough to do so.</p><p>An undead
      creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 x 5 temporary hit points for 1
      hour.</p>
