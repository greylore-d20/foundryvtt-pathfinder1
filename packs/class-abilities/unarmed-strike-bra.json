      "value": "<p>At 1st level, a brawler gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed Strike} as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.<p>Usually, a brawler’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.<p>A brawler’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1–5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Damage (Small Brawler)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Damage (Large Brawler)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st–3rd</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th–7th</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th–11th</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th–15th</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th–19th</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>3d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n<td>4d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
