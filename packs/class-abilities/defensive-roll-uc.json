      "value": "<p>The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. When she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If she succeeds, the rogue takes only half damage from the blow; if she fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll; if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can’t use this ability.</p>\n<p>Since such damage would not normally allow a character to attempt a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue’s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.</p>"
