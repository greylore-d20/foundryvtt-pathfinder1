This mithral buckler is painted black with three deep grooves running over the surface, each fitted with a slot that can hold a vial of poison. As a move action, the user can swipe a weapon over the surface of the buckler, coating it with a single dose of poison. The buckler can hold 3 doses of poison. If the wearer does not have the poison use ability, she faces the standard risk of poisoning herself</p>"
