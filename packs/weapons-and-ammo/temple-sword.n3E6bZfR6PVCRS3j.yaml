  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Heavy blades typically used by guardians of religious sites, temple
      swords have distinctive crescentshaped blades, which appear to be an
      amalgam of sickle and sword. Many have holes drilled into the blade or the
      pommel so that charms, bells, or other holy trinkets can be attached to
      reflect the owner's devotion or to serve as foci for prayer or meditation.
      Monks are proficient with the temple sword.</p>
