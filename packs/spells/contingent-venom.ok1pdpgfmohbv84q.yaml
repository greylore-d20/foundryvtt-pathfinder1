      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.1rt2lg6tt2kms0z0]{languid venom}, but you
      can stipulate a specific condition or circumstance that will end the
      poison's onset time and cause it to take effect. The conditions for
      triggering the poison can be as general or as detailed as desired, but the
      triggers must be visual or audible (as per <em>magic</em> mouth) or else
      based on physical contact with or consumption of a specific object,
      substance, or creature. This triggering condition can either result in the
      immediate onset of the poison, or cause the poison to take effect a number
      of rounds after being triggered no greater than 1 round per caster level.
      You must make all decisions involving triggering when you cast
      <em>contingent venom</em>, and you can't change those decisions later.</p>
