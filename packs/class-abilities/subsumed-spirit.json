      "value": "<p>As the alchemist grows in power, his parasitic twin laps up a portion of his soul, like a dog feeding on its master’s scraps. The alchemist’s parasitic twin can now manifest or hide within the alchemist’s torso as a move action. As a standard action, the alchemist can cause his manifested twin to babble, driving listeners insane. All creatures without the insanity special ability that are within 60 feet of the alchemist must succeed at a Will save or be affected by confusion for 1 round per alchemist level. The alchemist can urge his parasitic twin to babble a number of times per day equal to 3 + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. Creatures that successfully save can’t be affected by this effect for 24 hours. The alchemist is immune to its sibling’s babbling. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>\n<p>The alchemist must have the parasitic twin discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>"
