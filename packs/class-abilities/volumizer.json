      "value": "<p>The alchemist can use an extract slot of any level to create a reactive tablet that purifies water and doubles its volume. This works like purify food and drink for a maximum volume of water equal to 1 gallon for each level the alchemist has × the level of the extract slot the alchemist used to create the tablet. Additionally, if the alchemist has a receptacle of sufficient volume to gather the water, the tablet doubles the volume of pure water. The water volume increases over the course of 1 minute, but the effect stops before it can create significant water pressure on a container that’s not large enough to hold the entire volume. An unused tablet remains usable until the next time the alchemist recovers extract slots.</p>"
