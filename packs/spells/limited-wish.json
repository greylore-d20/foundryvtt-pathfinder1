For example, a <i>limited wish</i> can do any of the following things.</p><p><ul><li> Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.</p><p><li> Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.</p><p><li> Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.</p><p><li> Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.</p><p><li> Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as <i>geas/quest</i> or <i>insanity</i>.</p><p><li> Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -7 penalty on its next saving throw.</p><p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a <i>limited wish</i> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).</ul></p>",
