      <p>As part of the casting of this spell, you must deal 1 point of piercing
      or slashing damage to yourself to release your blood. This causes you to
      take 1 point of bleed damage. While the spell is in effect, all sharks,
      feeders in the depths, and creatures with the blood frenzy ability in the
      area gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a -2 penalty to
      AC. This is treated as blood frenzy for the purposes of other feats and
      effects, and doesn't stack with the effects of actual blood frenzy. If you
      cease bleeding, the spell immediately ends.</p>
