      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.JournalEntry.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.7LwCMwrX3tchvrjW]{sickened}
      condition. When the character has the selected condition and hits a
      creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the character
      no longer has that condition. A character can take this talent up to three
      times. Each time, she must select a different condition that she is able
      to remove from herself with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage.
      Even if the character has taken this talent multiple times, she can remove
      only a single effect on herself with each melee attack that deals sneak
      attack damage.</p>
