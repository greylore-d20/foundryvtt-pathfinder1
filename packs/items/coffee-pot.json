Heating the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Pot\">pot</a> forces boiling water through the tube and into the grounds. A glass knob at the top of the tube allows you to see the color of the brew and stop when it is sufficiently strong. It can brew up to 4 cups of coffee at a time. It can also be used to make <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-tea\">tea</a>, steep medicinal herbs, or just boil water.</p> \n"
