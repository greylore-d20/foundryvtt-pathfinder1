      Groups</b> Hammers</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Named for the common
      aspergillum, a macelike tool used by priests to sprinkle holy water, this
      light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug closing off the hole through
      which the head is filled. When the mace strikes a creature, holy water
      sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures
      subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to
      the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum
      can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even
      if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum
      is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a
      standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity (like drinking a
      potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, to prevent the
      holy water from leaking out as the weapon moves.</p>
