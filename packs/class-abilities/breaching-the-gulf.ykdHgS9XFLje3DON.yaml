  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, your <em>caster level</em> is increased by 3 when
      casting spells of the teleportation subschool. In addition, once per day
      you can <em>teleport</em> a single creature within 30 feet into the void
      of space if it fails a <em>Will</em> save. The save DC is equal to 10 +
      1/2 your sorcerer level + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier. The target can
      attempt a new <em>saving throw</em> as a <em>full-round action</em> each
      round to return. While trapped in the airless void, the target suffers 6d6
      points of cold damage per round and must hold its breath or begin to
      suffocate.</p>
