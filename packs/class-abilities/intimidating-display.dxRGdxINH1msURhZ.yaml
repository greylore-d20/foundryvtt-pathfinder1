      <p>The shaman can call upon some of the majesty and power of dragons to
      cow her enemies. The shaman gains
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.3cq9YbgcMrAXC76j]{Dazzling Display} as a bonus feat,
      even if she does not meet the prerequisites, and she can use it even when
      not wielding a weapon.</p>
