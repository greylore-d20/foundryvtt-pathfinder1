      <p>The target gains the ability to absorb power from devouring a humanoid
      corpse. To use this ability, the target must feed on the corpse of one
      nonevil humanoid creature, a process that takes 1 full round per Hit Die
      the creature had and provokes attacks of opportunity. For every 2 rounds
      it feeds on the corpse in this way, the target gains a +1 profane bonus on
      attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks (to a maximum of +5).</p>
