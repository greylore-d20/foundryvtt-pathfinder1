  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the area.
    The <i>shifting sand</i> obliterates tracks and is considered difficult
    terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster
    level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the
    <i>shifting sand</i> must make a Reflex save each round or become entangled
    until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while
    entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with
    the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their
    saving throws.</p><p>As a move action, you may move the area of <i>shifting
    sand</i> up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or
    prone in the spell's area are carried along with the <i>shifting sand</i> in
    the same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of
    opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects may also be carried along
    or shallowly buried by the <i>shifting sand</i>.</p>
