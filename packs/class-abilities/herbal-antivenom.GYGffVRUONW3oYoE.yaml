      <p>Your body can produce the herbal remedies necessary to counter almost
      any poison. You gain a +5 alchemical bonus on saving throws against
      poison, as if you were always under the effect of antitoxin. You can use
      the treat poison action from the Heal skill as a standard action with a
      mere touch, without a healerâ€™s kit, and even on yourself; if you succeed,
      you grant the touched creature a +5 alchemical bonus against that specific
      instance of poison in addition to the normal +4 bonus from treat
      poison.</p>

      <p>You can accept 1 point of burn while using the treat poison action in
      this way to also produce the effects of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.6l904edkt8jv9jor]{Neutralize Poison}.</p>
