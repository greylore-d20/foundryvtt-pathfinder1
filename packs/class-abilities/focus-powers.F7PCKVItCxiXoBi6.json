      "value": "<p>At 1st level, an occultist learns the base focus power from both of his two implement schools and can select one more focus power from the list of those available to him through those schools. Whenever the occultist learns a new implement school, he gains the base power of that school.</p>\n<p>In addition, at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, he learns a new focus power selected from the options granted by all of the implement schools he knows. The occultist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the occultist’s level + the occultist’s Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>The occultist can’t select a focus power more than once. Some focus powers require him to reach a specific occultist level before he can choose them.</p>"
