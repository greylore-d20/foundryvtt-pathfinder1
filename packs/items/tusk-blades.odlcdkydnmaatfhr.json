If the creature makes a gore attack (including as part of a <em>powerful charge</em>), the attack deals both piercing and slashing damage, and has a critical threat range of 19-20 (this range can be increased by other effects). Tusk blades can be enhanced as melee weapons; the enhancement is applied to the creature's gore attack.</p>"
