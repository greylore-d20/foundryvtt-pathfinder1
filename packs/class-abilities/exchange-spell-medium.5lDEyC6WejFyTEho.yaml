  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third class level after that
      (8th, 11th, and so on), the character can choose to learn a new spell in
      place of one he already knows. In effect, the character “loses” the old
      spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same
      as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level
      lower than the highest-level class spell the character can cast. A
      character may swap only a single spell at any given level and must choose
      whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells
      known for the level.</p><h3>Class Specific
      Restrictions</h3><ul><li>Occultist swapped spell must come from the same
      list of spells provided by the implement school of the spell
      lost.</li><li>Mediums are allowed to swap spells of all levels the medium
      can currently cast, even highest-level.</li></ul>
