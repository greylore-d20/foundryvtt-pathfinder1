  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.rekl0ikgnorz60jc]{Hide
    from Undead}, except the spell does not immediately end if a warded creature
    attempts to turn or command undead, channels positive energy, touches an
    undead creature, or attacks any creature. Instead, when the warded creature
    takes one of these actions, an intelligent undead creature can attempt
    another Will saving throw to negate the effects of the spell.</p>
