      <p>You override the target's ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as
      <i>pain strike</i>** and <i>symbol of</i> pain) do not affect the target
      until this spell's duration has expired. This does not negate any physical
      damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain effect has already
      done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain while the spell
      lasts.</p>
