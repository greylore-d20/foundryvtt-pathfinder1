      <p>You cause torrents of roiling blood to push your opponents away from
      you. This wave attempts a bull rush combat maneuver against all creatures
      within its area of effect, and you bull rush creatures of any size in this
      way. Attempt a single combat maneuver check and apply the result to each
      creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your
      caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier,
      whichever is highest. This bull rush doesn't provoke attacks of
      opportunity. Any creature in the area  must also succeed at a Fortitude
      saving throw or become sickened for 1d6 rounds by the tide of blood.  The
      area covered by the cone remains slick for 1 round, requiring a successful
      DC 10 Acrobatics check from any creature attempting to move within it (as
      if moving on uneven ground). Any creature that falls prone due to failing
      the check must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened until it
      stands back up.</p>
