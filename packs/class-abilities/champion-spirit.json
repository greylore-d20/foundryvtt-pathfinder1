      "value": "<p><em>A champion spirit is a paragon of skill at arms.</em><br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Bonus: </strong>When you channel a champion, your spirit bonus applies on attack rolls, non-spell damage rolls, Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, and Fortitude saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Seance Boon: </strong>You gain a +2 bonus on all non-spell damage rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations: </strong>Arenas, battlefields, places of violence, practice yards.</p>\n<p><strong>Influence Penalty: </strong>You are quick to violence and prefer a weapon to spells or contemplation. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks, and to your caster level (to a minimum of caster level 0); as usual, a reduced caster level may render you unable to cast spells. You can’t benefit from effects that increase your caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Taboos: </strong>Choose one: you are superstitious about arcane spellcasting, so you must not be the willing target of arcane spells or abilities and you must attempt a Will saving throw against even harmless arcane spells and abilities; you may not make an attack with any weapon except a specific manufactured weapon (such as “my father’s&nbsp;+2 falchion”) that you choose when you take the taboo, and you may not choose unarmed strike for this taboo; you must accept any challenge to prove your prowess in battle, including challenges to single combat—if you or an ally breaks the rules of the challenge, you break this taboo.</p>"
