Anyone lacking the <em>goblinoid</em> subtype who drinks hobgoblin war draught must immediately make a DC 15 <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>sickened</em> for 1 hour; success means the drinker ignores all penalties resulting from the <em>fatigued</em> and <em>shaken</em> conditions for 1 minute, after which he is <em>sickened</em> for 10 minutes.
