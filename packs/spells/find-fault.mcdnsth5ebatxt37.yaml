  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You instantly learn many of the target's weaknesses, as if you had made
    an appropriate Knowledge skill check with a result equal to 20 + your caster
    level. Additionally, your first melee or ranged attack roll against the
    creature before the end of your next turn gains a +5 insight bonus. If the
    creature is polymorphed, disguised, or hidden by an illusion and you are not
    aware of it's true form, this spell fails as if the target has spell
    resistance you failed to penetrate (the GM may have you attempt a caster
    level check to conceal the true reason for the spell's failure).</p>
