The warded creature becomes encircled by a group of flying bones that grant it a +2 deflection bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the shamanâ€™s level.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the ward increases to +3 and lasts for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, the bonus increases to +4 and lasts for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>Once the bone ward ends, the creature cannot be the target of the hex again for 24 hours.</p>"
