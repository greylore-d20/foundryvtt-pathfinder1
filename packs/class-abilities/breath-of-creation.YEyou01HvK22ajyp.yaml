    value: >-
      <p>Volcanic vapors elevate your mind even as they ravage your body. When
      you take Constitution damage from volcanic gases, you gain a bonus to your
      Charisma equal to the damage taken. This bonus lasts for 1 hour or until
      the ability damage is healed. The maximum bonus to your Charisma is +2,
      increasing to +4 at 10th level, and to +6 at 15th level.</p>
