      <p>At 9th level, you gain telepathy (100 feet) and can communicate with
      creatures with a swim speed or the <em>aquatic</em> or <em>water</em>

      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zqj5qzyl46af27v0]{Suggestion} on such creatures a
      number of times per day equal to your <em>Charisma</em> modifier. This
      ability is telepathic and does not require audible or visual
      <em>components</em>. At 15th level, once per day you can telepathically
      call and request a service from an aquatic, water, or swimming creature as
