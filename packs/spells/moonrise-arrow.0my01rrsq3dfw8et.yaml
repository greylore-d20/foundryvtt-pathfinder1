  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause ammunition, including shuriken, to glow with faint silvery
    light. The ammunition counts as magic and silver for the purpose of
    overcoming damage reduction, in addition to the properties of any other
    special material the ammunition has. Incorporeal undead and shapechangers
    take an additional 1d8 points of damage from such ammunition. The targeted
    ammunition sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 round after it is fired
    or thrown.</p>
