      attack that deals an amount of piercing damage appropriate for your size
      (1d8 for a Large creature, 1d6 for Medium, 1d4 for Small) as a secondary
      natural attack. You begin each combat with the sickened condition until
      you deal damage with your bite attack.</p>

      against creatures smaller than yourself.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, your bite attack deals damage as if you were one size
      category larger.</p>
