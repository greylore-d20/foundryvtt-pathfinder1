  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You quickly absorb the knowledge in the target, which can be any
    assortment of books, scrolls, or other texts. During the spell's duration,
    you can search the texts and immediately find the most relevant information
    regarding any topic the collection holds, potentially including singling out
    spellbooks or scrolls containing individual or particular types of spells.
    You can attempt Knowledge checks related to the collection's topics as if
    you were trained in those skills, and you know whether the collection
    contains any information about which you failed a Knowledge check in the
    past 24 hours. The bonus on Knowledge checks granted by the collection of
    texts (if any) increases by 2.  Additionally, you always deplete the maximum
    number of knowledge points from a library whenever you succeed at a Research
    check (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue</i> 148) using the target texts
    while this spell is in effect, even if completing the Research check takes
    longer than this spell lasts. Once during the duration of this spell, for a
    number of minutes equal to your caster level, you can also speak with the
    texts about anyone who has read or handled them previously, as per <i>stone
    tell</i>.</p>
