  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The focus of this spell flies upward above your head and takes a
    defensive position within your space. It lunges at opponents, as if guided
    by a martially trained hand, parrying and turning back melee attacks aimed
    at you, but does not strike back at any opponent nor does it damage them.
    The weapon serves only as a defense. While it protects you, you can cast
    spells without provoking attacks of opportunity, without the need to cast
    them defensively.  A creature with the Disruptive feat (<i>Core Rulebook</i>
    122) can easily bypass this spell's defenses. You provoke attacks of
    opportunity for casting spells against these creatures even when subject to
    this spell, though you can still choose to cast defensively.</p>
