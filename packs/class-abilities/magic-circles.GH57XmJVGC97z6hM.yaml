  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, an occultist learns how to draw magic circles. To draw a
      circle, he must have chalk, salt, blood, powdered silver, or some other
      appropriate substance at hand (although he can press a magic circle into a
      softer surface such as dirt or clay). Drawing a circle takes 1 minute and
      requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic
      focus or focus from any one of his implements). Once completed, this
      circle functions as a permanent magic circle against any alignment of the
      occultist’s choosing. The circle can’t be against a component of the
      occultist’s alignment (if he is lawful good, for example, it can’t be a
      magic circle against good or law). The circle remains until its form is
      physically broken (for example, if the lines are smeared or the salt is
      scattered). Only a living creature can break the circle; environmental
      effects can’t break it.</p>

      <p>An occultist can have only one circle created in this way at a time. If
      he creates a second circle, the first one loses all its magic powers. This
      type of magic circle can’t normally be focused inward to bind an
      outsider.</p>
