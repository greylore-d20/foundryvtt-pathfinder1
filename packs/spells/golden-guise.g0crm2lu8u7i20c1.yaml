  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause an object to briefly transform into gold. Affected items gain
    the properties of gold (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</i> 53) until
    the spell expires. Weapons reduce their hardness by half and gain the
    fragile quality, while piercing and slashing weapons take a -2 penalty on
    damage rolls (minimum 1 damage). This spell increases the affected item's
    armor check penalty by 2 and decreases its armor or shield bonus by 2. Gold
    armor has hardness 5.</p>
