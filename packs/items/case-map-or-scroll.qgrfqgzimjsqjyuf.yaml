    value: >-
      <p>A bone, leather, or wooden scroll case easily holds four
      <em>scrolls</em>; you can cram more inside but retrieving any of them
      becomes a <em>full-round action</em> rather than a <em>move action</em>.
      You must destroy the scroll case to damage its contents (<em>hardness</em>
      2 for leather or 5 for wood, 2 <em>hit points</em>, Break DC 15). A scroll
      case is not water-tight.</p>
