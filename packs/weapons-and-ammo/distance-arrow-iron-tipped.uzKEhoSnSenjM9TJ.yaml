  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Used tactically for long-range attacks on troops, these arrows are
      fitted with heavy iron heads. While these heads help them travel great
      distances, they make the arrows less effective at dealing
      damage.</p><p>Iron-tipped distance arrows increase their bow's range
      increment by 10 feet but take a -1 penalty on damage dealt per range
      increment (minimum 1 point of damage).</p><p>They are sold in leather
      quivers in quantities of 20.</p>
