While in this form, you gain a base speed of 30 feet, a fly speed of 60 feet (average), two talon attacks (1d6 damage), darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain Flyby Attack (Bestiary&nbsp;315) as a bonus feat, and the range of your darkvision increases to 120 feet.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you can take the form of a Large owl and gain the benefits of the Snatch feat (Bestiary&nbsp;316), but you can use it only to grab a creature at least one size category smaller than yourself, and you can squeeze a creature grappled with this ability no matter what size it is.<br><br><strong>Alternate Natural Attacks:</strong> Bite (B, P, S), talons (S)</p>"
