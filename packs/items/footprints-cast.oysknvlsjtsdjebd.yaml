      <p>This quick-drying cast is perfect for preserving a set of footprints in
      order to examine them later. By spending 1 minute setting the cast and
      waiting for it to dry, you can copy footprints, allowing others to examine
      them without traveling to the scene, and preventing the DC of the
      <em>Survival</em> check to analyze them from increasing because of time or
      weather.</p>
