      <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> In order to prepare this spell, the caster must
      spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches <b>Magrim</b>.
      Further details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of
      Golarion.</em></p><p>This spell enhances your spells that bring the dead
      back to life. If you cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.c5anior2ysy6s2xy]{raise
      dead}, the target creature is restored to full hit points. If you cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.qiiis9ekgy3syu7j]{breath of life}, that spell can
      revive a dead target as long as you cast it within a number of rounds
      equal to half your caster level, and the healing effect is treated as if
      the spell were empowered with the
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.77gXSucrxfrE9yWk]{Empower Spell} feat. Casting any
      of these spells discharges the <em>invigorating repose</em> spell.</p>
