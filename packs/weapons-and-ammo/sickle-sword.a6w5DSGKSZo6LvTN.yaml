  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Favored by those residents of Irrisen with no talent for witchcraft,
      this exotic blade curves multiple times along its 3-1/2 feet. The
      sickle-sword's hilt is long and curved, and its blade bears a small
      secondary grip partway up its length. These allow a wielder with a free
      hand to rapidly twist the sword in unpredictable ways. When wielding a
      sickle-sword in one hand and nothing in the other, you can spend a swift
      action to gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll before the end of your
      turn.</p>
