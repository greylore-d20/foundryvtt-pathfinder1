      <p>You mix a malign spirit into a piece of food, a drink, or some other
      item to be consumed (including alchemical items, potions, elixirs, or
      similar items). The <i>skin tag</i> spell discharges when the item is
      consumed, affecting the creature that used the item unless it succeeds at
      a Fortitude save. The spirit embeds itself somewhere in the affected
      creature's skin, forming a painless set of wrinkles and tags of skin that
      looks vaguely like a face when the haunt activates. You are considered to
      have a body part from the affected creature for the purpose of
      <i>scrying</i> and similar divination spells. Once per day as a standard
      action, you can remotely cause the spirit to make the affected creature's
      skin crawl, causing the creature to become sickened for 1d4 rounds + 1
      round per 2 caster levels you have (to a maximum of 5 extra rounds at 10th
      level) unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. Alternatively, once per day
      you can remotely use a hex, a mind-affecting spell, or a necromancy spell
      that causes disease or possession on the affected creature. Each time you
      use the  remote sickening or spell or hex effect, the spell's haunt-like
      manifestation occurs during that round.</p>
