    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent can use the items at hand and seemingly
      innocuous material hidden on her person to create startlingly effective
      disguises, reducing the amount of time it takes to create a disguise using
      the Disguise skill.<p>The time needed for the rogue to alter her
      appearance in this manner is based on the complexity of the disguise, as
      noted on the following table. The times are cumulative, so if a female
      rogue wants to disguise herself as a male of a different race, that takes
      2 minutes.<br><br></p>
