      <p>You compel the target to beg for forgiveness. On a failed save, the
      target cowers with fear. On a successful save, it is shaken for 1 round.
      Each round on its turn, a cowering subject may attempt a new save to end
      the effect. A creature who worships the same god as you takes a -2 penalty
      on its saving throw.</p>
