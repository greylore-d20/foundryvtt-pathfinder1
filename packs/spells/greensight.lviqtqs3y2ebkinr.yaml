  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target of this spell gains the ability to see up to 60 feet through
    thick plant matter as though it were transparent. Greenery, leaves, and
    vines-even lichen, moss, and slime-offer no concealment to the recipient's
    sight, though her vision still can be blocked by solid wood, such as trees
    or wooden structures. Undergrowth does not grant concealment to a creature
    against a target of the effects of <i>greensight</i>.</p>
