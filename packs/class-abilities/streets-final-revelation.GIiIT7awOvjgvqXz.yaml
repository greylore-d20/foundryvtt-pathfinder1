  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, you become an avatar of the city. When you
      speak the name of a creature and a city out loud, you know whether that
      creature is in that city. You can also learn about any settlement you are
      in at will; this functions as commune with nature, operating only in towns
      and settlements rather than natural terrain.</p>
