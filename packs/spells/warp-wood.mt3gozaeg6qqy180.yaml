    value: >-
      <p>You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its
      straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes
      stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship
      springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon
      causes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p><p>You may warp one Small or
      smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts
      as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a
      Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.</p><p>Alternatively,
      you can un<i>warp wood</i> (effectively warping it back to normal) with
      this spell. <i>Make whole</i>, on the other hand, does no good in
      repairing a warped item.</p><p>You can combine multiple consecutive
      <i>warp wood</i> spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large
      for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely
      warped, it suffers no ill effects.</p>
