      <p>This spell causes your eidolon to take on new
      characteristics.</p><p>You can grant the eidolon any evolution whose total
      cost does not exceed 2 evolution points. You may only grant one evolution
      with this spell, even if that evolution can be taken multiple
      times.</p><p>You can grant an evolution that allows you to spend
      additional evolution points to upgrade that evolution. This spell cannot

      possesses. The eidolon must meet any prerequisites of the selected
      evolution. This spell does not allow an eidolon to exceed its maximum
      number of natural attacks.</p>
