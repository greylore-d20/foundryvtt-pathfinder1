      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, a vampire hunter can travel for an extended period of time without rest. The vampire hunter (and his mount, if he has one) can walk 16 hours in a day of travel without it being considered a forced march, but at the end of that day, he must attempt a DC 15 <em>Fortitude</em> saving throw. If he fails, he can travel for 8 hours the following day, and he (as well as his mount, if he has one) is <em>fatigued</em> for the following 24 hours. If he succeeds at the saving throw, he can use this ability again the following day. The DC of the <em>Fortitude</em> saving throw increases by 2 for every additional day the vampire hunter has been traveling for more than 8 hours. The vampire hunter does not need to attempt a separate saving throw for his mount. After the vampire hunter rests for 24 hours, the saving throw DC resets to 15.</p>"
