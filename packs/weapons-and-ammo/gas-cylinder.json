It is usually placed on the  ground and triggered so that the wind blows the gas toward  enemy positions. Normally, multiple gas cylinders are  placed in line and triggered together to cover a wider area  of the battlefield. First, determine what direction the wind  is blowing by rolling 1d4 (1 is north, 2 is east, 3 is south,  and 4 is west). When triggered, a gas cylinder releases a  cloud of mustard gas (see the sidebar on page 67) in a 15-  foot cone. On the following 2 rounds, the cloud extends  by an additional 15-foot square away from the canister,  forming a 15-foot-wide, 45-foot-long cloud at the end of  3 rounds. The cloud moves with the wind, rolling along  the surface of the ground, and disperses after 10 rounds. A  strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and  a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.</p>"
