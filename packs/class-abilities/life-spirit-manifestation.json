      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a perfect channel for life energy. She gains immunity to bleed, death attacks, and negative energy, as well as to the exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, and sickened conditions. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce her to below 1 in any ability score. She automatically succeeds at saving throws against massive damage. When she is reduced to below 0 hit points, she doesnâ€™t die until her negative hit point total exceeds double her Constitution score.</p>"
