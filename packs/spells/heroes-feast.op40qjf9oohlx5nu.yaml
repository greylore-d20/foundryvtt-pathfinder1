    value: >-
      <p>You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table, chairs,
      service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the
      beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every creature
      partaking of the feast is cured of all sickness and nausea, receives the
      benefits of both neutralize poison and remove disease, and gains 1d8
      temporary hit points + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) after
      imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is part of the feast. The ambrosial
      food grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls
      and Will saves and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against poison and
      fear effects for 12 hours.</p><p>If the feast is interrupted for any
      reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.</p>
