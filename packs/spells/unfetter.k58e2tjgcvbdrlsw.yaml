    value: >-
      <p>This spell breaks the life link between you and your eidolon. This
      spell allows your eidolon to venture more than 100 feet away from you
      without penalty. It can travel any distance while this spell is in effect
      without penalty, but if the spell expires while the eidolon is farther
      than 100 feet away, it immediately loses hit points as normal for distance
      and is possibly sent back to its home plane. While this spell is in
      effect, you cannot sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to your eidolon.
      Damage that would be transferred due to the life bond ability is not
      transferred. If you attempt to use the transposition ability while this
      spell is in effect, you must roll on the <i>teleport</i> mishap table,
      using the "studied carefully" row.</p>
