      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except that all creatures within 60 feet of a <em>symbol of stunning</em>
      instead become stunned for 1d6 rounds.</p><p><em>Note:</em> Magic traps
      such as <em>symbol of stunning</em> are hard to detect and disable. A
      rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <em>symbol of
      stunning</em> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 +
      spell level, or 32 for <em>symbol of stunning</em>.</p>
