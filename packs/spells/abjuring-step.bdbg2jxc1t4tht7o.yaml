  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell creates a subtle and complicated force effect that is most
    effective when used by a still or slow-moving spellcaster or formula user.
    While you are subject to this spell, you can take two 5-foot steps each
    round and still cast spells and use spell-like abilities without provoke
    attacks of opportunity. This spell automatically discharges as soon as you
    make an attack, cast a harmful spell against another creature, or move more
    than 5 feet with a single move action. If the action that discharges the
    spell also provokes attacks of opportunity, that action still provokes
    attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>
