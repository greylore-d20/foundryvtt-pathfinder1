  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the
      major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as
      beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major
      form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a
      major form or back is a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of
      opportunity. Often a particular aspect’s major form grants abilities
      beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the
      abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she
      gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she
      still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.<p>A shifter
      loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to
      the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she
      can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her
      form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.<p>A shifter
      can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter
      level + her Wisdom modifier. It need not be consecutive but must be spent
      in 1 hour increments. For abilities that function based on ‘uses of wild
      shape,’ each hour of wild shape counts as a use.<p>A shifters can take
      feats and other abilities that require wild shape; for the purpose of
      qualifying for prerequisites, her effective druid level is equal to her
      shifter level.</p>
