    "shortDescription": "<p>You invest a target with cursed elemental energy, making the open skies anathema to it. If the affected creature ever tries to fly more than 5 feet above the ground, paper insects erupt from the air around the creature to interfere with its movement. The affected creature's flight maneuverability decreases by one step for every 3 caster levels you have. A creature whose maneuverability would be brought below clumsy must land at the end of its turn each round or fall.</p>\n<p>This spell does not affect incorporeal creatures or creatures that are otherwise intangible (such as a wizard using @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous Form} to fly).</p>"
