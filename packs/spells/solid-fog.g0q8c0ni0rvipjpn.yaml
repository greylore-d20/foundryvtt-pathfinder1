  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{fog cloud}, but in
      addition to obscuring sight, the <em>solid fog</em> is so thick that it
      impedes movement.</p><p>Creatures moving through a <em>solid fog</em> move
      at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and
      melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks
      (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into
      <em>solid fog</em> is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes
      through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a
      5-foot-step while in <em>solid fog</em>. <em>Solid fog</em>, and effects
      that work like <em>solid fog</em>, do not stack with each other in terms
      of slowed movement and attack penalties.</p><p>Unlike normal fog, only a
      severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1
      round.</p><p><em>Solid fog</em> can be made permanent with a
      <em>permanency</em> spell. A permanent <em>solid fog</em> dispersed by
      wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>
