  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target gains the ability to absorb power from devouring a humanoid
    corpse. To use this ability, the target must feed on the corpse of one
    nonevil humanoid creature, a process that takes 1 full round per Hit Die the
    creature had and provokes attacks of opportunity. For every 2 rounds it
    feeds on the corpse in this way, the target gains a +1 profane bonus on
    attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks (to a maximum of +5).</p>
