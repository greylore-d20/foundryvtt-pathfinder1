  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You build upon your targets' innate prejudice, stoking it from a simmer
      to the full flame of hatred. Choose a creature type (if you choose
      humanoid or outsider, you must also choose a subtype). Targets who hold no
      ill will toward and have a completely positive opinion of the chosen
      creatures automatically succeed at their saving throws, while targets with
      a particular hatred toward the chosen creature (such as the dwarf's hatred
      racial ability) take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. Targets that
      fail their saving throws become hostile toward all creatures of the chosen
      type and never treat them as allies for the spell's duration. Affected
      creatures take everything creatures of the chosen type do in the worst
      possible light.  Since most creatures don't hold ill-will toward their own
      race, you can use <i>foster hatred</i> toward a smaller subset of
      creatures of your chosen type, such as worshipers of Shelyn, in order to
      focus the hatred onto your chosen targets.</p>
