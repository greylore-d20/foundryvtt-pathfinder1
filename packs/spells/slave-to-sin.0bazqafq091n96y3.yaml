  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell allows you to reach into an evil creature's mind to expose
      and exploit its susceptibility to whichever of the seven so-called "deadly
      sins" it is most susceptible to. The targeted creature must succeed at a
      Will save or it is overwhelmed with an inability to repress urges to
      indulge in whatever sin most closely mirrors its personality, and a
      glowing rune appears upon the creature's body (usually the brow),
      identifying the sin. (The GM adjudicates which rune manifests on the
      creature's body, as appropriate.) Each round, at the start of its turn,
      the target must attempt a new Will saving throw against the spell's DC to
      resist the sin's enslavement. If the target succeeds at this saving throw,
      it is sickened for that round by the distractions of its sin. If it fails,
      it is sickened and staggered as it spends part of its action wallowing in
      its targeted sin (a wrathful victim might waste time spouting threats and
      profanity, while a slothful victim might merely be slow and hesitant, and
      a lustful victim could well spend precious moments ogling or fawning over
      something of beauty).</p>
