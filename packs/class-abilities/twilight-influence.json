      "value": "<p>You can channel spell energy into spells drawn from the Darkness cleric domain. This ability functions similarly to the cleric’s ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, but you instead spontaneously cast Darkness domain spells. The domain spells don’t count as being on your psychic spell list for the purposes of any other effects (unless they are independently on your psychic spell list, such as blindness/deafness). Each day, you can convert up to one spell from each spell level you can cast.</p>\n<p>Each time you use this ability to convert a spell, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>"
