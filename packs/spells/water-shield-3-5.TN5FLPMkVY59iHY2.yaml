    value: >-
      <p>This spell surrounds you in a spout of clear acid that aids in
      deflecting attacks and damages creatures that attack you in melee. The
      constantly upward-rushing waters grant you a measure of protecting,
      shielding you so you only take half damage from acid and fire-based
      attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take
      no damage on a successful save.</p><p>Any creature striking you with its
      body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the
      attacker takes 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels
      (maximum +10). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this
      effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject
      to this damage if they attack you.</p>
