You can surround yourself with heated air as a swift action, gaining concealment (as per the&nbsp;blur&nbsp;spell).</p>\n<p>At 7th level while you are using this ability, your melee attacks each deal an additional 2 points of fire damage. You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level per day; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>"
