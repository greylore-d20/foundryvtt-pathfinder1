  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can bash an opponent with a shield, using it as an off-hand weapon.
      Used this way, a shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. If you use your
      shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next turn. An
      enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a
      shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon
      in its own right.</p>
