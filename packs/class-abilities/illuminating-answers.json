When you use a spell or spell-like ability that allows you to get answers to questions (such as augury, blood biography, or contact other plane) and get at least one answer, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You regain this point even if the answer is false or vague.</p>\n<p>The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>"
