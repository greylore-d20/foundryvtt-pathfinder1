      <p>Those under the effects of this spell become faster in the use of
      thrown weapons. They can draw thrown weapons (including rocks if they have
      the rock throwing ability) on their bodies or within their space without
      the need for the Quick Draw feat, allowing them to make their full normal
      rate of attacks with such weapons. This has no effects on other forms of
      ranged weapon ammunition.</p>
