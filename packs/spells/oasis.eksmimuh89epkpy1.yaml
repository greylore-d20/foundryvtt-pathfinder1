  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions in any natural terrain on the Material Plane. It
    redirects the flow of water in the ground toward the surface at the
    designated point, creating a permanent water source similar to a natural
    spring. The spring discharges 5 gallons of pure drinking water per caster
    level each hour. If the shape of the terrain is suitable, a pond forms
    around the spring. If there is already a natural spring within 1 mile, its
    water output is reduced by an amount equal to the water produced by this
    spell's spring. A spring that has its water output reduced to 0 gallons per
    hour dries up and ceases to be a spring.  This spell functions differently
    depending on the terrain in which it's cast. In a desert, you must succeed
    at a DC 25 caster level check to actually create the spring, and its output
    is 1 gallon of drinking water per caster level each day. Furthermore, in dry
    areas, erosion may cause the flow of water to be blocked if the affected
    area is left untended before a sufficient amount of vegetation has grown
    around it to keep the soil in place. In an arctic environment, low
    temperatures may cause the water to freeze. In a tropical environment,
    parasites may contaminate the water if the spring is created in a place
    where the water stands in a stagnant pool.</p>
