  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, when a magus prepares his magus spells, he can decide to
      expend 1 or more points from his arcane pool, up to his Intelligence
      bonus. For each point he expends, he can treat any one spell from the
      magus spell list as if it were in his spellbook and can prepare that spell
      as normal that day. If he does not cast spells prepared in this way before
      the next time he prepares spells, he loses those spells. He can also cast
      spells added in this way using his spell recall ability, but only until he
      prepares spells again.</p>
