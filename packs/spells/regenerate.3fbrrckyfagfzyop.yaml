  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms,
    legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and
    ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration
    is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the
    creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.</p><p><i>Regenerate</i> also cures
    4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +35), rids the
    subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the
    subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including
    undead).</p>
