  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You take control of a creature's mind and implant deadly subconscious
      commands. This spell functions as <i>dominate person</i>, allowing you to
      control your subject and see through her senses, but also implants a
      powerful burst of psychic energy in the subject's mind. At any point
      during the spell's duration, you can trigger this burst as an immediate
      action, dealing 1d8 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude half) to
      the subject. If this damage is enough to reduce to target to 0 or fewer
      hit points, the target dies instantly.  Your target can also willingly
      trigger this psychic burst as an immediate action. You can specify
      conditions (such as being captured) when she should do so, though such
      orders are considered dangerous and allow the subject a new Will saving
      throw with a +2 bonus.</p>
