When she uses this ability, she selects one ninja trick (not a master trick or rogue talent) that she does not know and can use that ninja trick for a number of rounds equal to her level.</p>\n<p>She must pay any&nbsp;ki&nbsp;costs associated with the trick as normal. Using this ability expends 2&nbsp;ki&nbsp;point from her&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool, plus the&nbsp;ki&nbsp;cost of the trick she chooses.</p>"
