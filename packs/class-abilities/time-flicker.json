      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can flicker in and out of time, gaining concealment (as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.18kryvj2dfuymk9d]{Blur} spell). You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level that you possess per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, each time you activate this ability, you can treat it as the&nbsp;blink&nbsp;spell, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your normal time flicker duration.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>"
