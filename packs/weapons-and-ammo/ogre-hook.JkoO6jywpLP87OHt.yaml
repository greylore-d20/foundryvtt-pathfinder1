  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This large crook of sharpened metal makes it easy to trip and catch
      fleeing opponents. Invented by ogres, most ogre hooks are Large and
      crudely fashioned-often from metal torn from previous victims' weapons and
      armor. Despite their poor workmanship, the rarity and peril involved in
      getting ogre hooks make such items quite valuable.</p>
