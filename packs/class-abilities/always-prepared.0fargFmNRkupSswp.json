      "value": "<p>The vigilante can set aside resources to plan for future contingencies. The vigilante gains the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Brilliant%20Planner\">Brilliant Planner</a> feat except he can spend up to 100 gp per character level for his brilliant plan fund and only requires 1 minute to enact his brilliant plan. In addition, while in a settlement for at least 1 week, he can spend 24 hours and up to 500 gp per character level to create a stash somewhere within the settlement.</p>\n<p>Once per day, the vigilante can take 1 hour to retrieve a stash, retrieving any number of items that would have been available in a settlement he visited at the time of making the stash, regardless of the weight of the items. Once he retrieves a stash in this way, he subtracts the price of the items from the stash’s value and the stash is exhausted and lost, regardless if he used the full value of the stash.</p>\n<p>The vigilante can maintain any number of stashes, but a stash is lost if he does not spend 1 hour to maintain the stash at least once per month. A vigilante’s stash is well-hidden and only the vigilante knows the location of a stash he creates.</p>"
