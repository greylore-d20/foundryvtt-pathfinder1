    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, a rogue has mastered a single skill beyond that skillâ€™s
      normal boundaries, gaining results that others can only dream about. She
      gains the skill unlock powers for that skill as appropriate for her number
      of ranks in that skill.</p>

      <p>At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, she chooses an additional skill and
      gains skill unlock powers for that skill as well.</p>
