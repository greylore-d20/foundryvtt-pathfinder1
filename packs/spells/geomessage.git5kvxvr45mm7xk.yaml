  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a written message of 50 words or fewer, or else an image, a
      drawing, or a similar diagram. The figment hangs invisible and obscured
      upon the target surface for the duration of the spell. Another casting of
      <i>geomessage</i> is needed to cause the figment to arrange itself into
      the intended message.  When you cast the spell, you can choose to
      incorporate a passphrase into the spell. If you do so, the message is
      protected as if <i>nondetection</i> had been cast on it for the full
      duration of the spell, though creatures that cast <i>geomessage</i> on the
      surface and speak the passphrase ignore the <i>nondetection</i> effect and
      cause the image to become visible until the caster speaks the passphrase
      again.  Without a passphrase, the message simply remains invisible to
      those who cast <i>geomessage</i>. Detection methods like <i>detect
      magic</i> and <i>see invisibility</i> indicate the message's presence but
      do not reveal its contents.</p>
