      <p>A giant, glowing symbol of wrath appears below you, forcibly repulsing
      all nearby creatures. All creatures within the area of effect take 1d6
      points of force damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are subjected
      to a bull rush that attempts to push them directly away from you. The
      blast's bull rush effect has a CMB bonus equal to your caster level + your
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). You are
      unaffected by both the spell's damage and its bull rush effect, and may
      select up to one creature per 4 caster levels to also be ignored by the
      spells effects.</p>
