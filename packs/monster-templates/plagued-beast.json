      "value": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong> Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong> No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong> No<p>When animals are stricken with demon plague, they may arise as undead and further spread the disease. Some demons and cultists are fond of using plagued horses as mounts.<p>“Plagued beast” is an acquired template that can be added to a living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A plagued beast uses all of the creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 1.<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Neutral evil.<p><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). It retains all subtypes except alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. Do not recalculate its saves, BAB, or skill ranks.<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Increase the base creature’s AC by 2.<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all of the creature’s racial Hit Dice to d8s. As undead, plagued beasts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points.<p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> Plagued beasts gain darkvision 60 feet, channel resistance +2, and DR 5/slashing. They are immune to cold, and gain all of the standard undead traits.<p><strong>Melee: </strong>A plagued beast gains a bite attack that deals damage based on the plagued beast’s size. If the beast already has a bite attack, the bite’s damage increases by one step, as if it had increased one size category.<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A plagued beast inflicts demon plague with each successful bite attack (DC = 10 + 1/2 the plagued beast’s Hit Dice + the plagued beast’s Charisma modifier).<p><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity. A plagued beast has a minimum Charisma score of 15—if the base creature’s Charisma score is lower, increase it to 15. A plagued beast has no Constitution score; as an undead, it uses its Charisma when calculating its hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special abilities that rely on Constitution.<p><strong>Feats:</strong> A plagued beast gains <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Toughness\">Toughness</a> as a bonus feat.</p>"
