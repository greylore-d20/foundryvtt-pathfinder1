  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monk with this ki power gains the ability to assume an ethereal state
      for 1 minute as though using the spell
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gw9bes9othfqm7mi]{Etherealness}, using his monk
      level as his caster level.</p>

      <p>Using this ability is a move action that consumes 3 points from the
      monkâ€™s ki pool.</p>

      <p>This ability affects only the monk and cannot be used to make other
      creatures ethereal.</p>
