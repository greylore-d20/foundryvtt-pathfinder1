          <p>An animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with
          no magical abilities and no innate capacity for language or culture.
          Animals usually have additional information on how they can serve as
          companions.</p>

          <h2>Features</h2>

          <p>An animal has the following features (unless otherwise noted).</p>

          <ul>

          <li>d8 Hit Die.</li>

          <li>Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (medium
          progression).</li>

          <li>Good <em>Fortitude</em> and <em>Reflex</em> saves.</li>

          <li>Skill points equal to 2 + <em>Int</em> modifier (minimum 1) per
          Hit Die. The following are class skills for animals:
          <em>Acrobatics</em>, <em>Climb</em>, <em>Fly</em>,
          <em>Perception</em>, <em>Stealth</em>, and <em>Swim</em>.</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>Traits</h2>

          <p>An animal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in
          a creature’s entry).</p>

          <ul>

          <li><em>Intelligence</em> score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an
          <em>Intelligence</em> score of 3 or higher can be an animal).</li>

          <li><em>Low-light vision</em>.</li>

          <li>Alignment: Always neutral.</li>

          <li>Treasure: None.</li>

          <li>Proficient with its natural weapons only. A non-combative
          herbivore treats its natural weapons as secondary attacks. Such
          attacks are made with a –5 penalty on the creature’s attack rolls, and
          the animal receives only 1/2 its <em>Strength</em> modifier as a
          damage adjustment.</li>

          <li>Proficient with no armor unless trained for war. (See
          <em>FAQ</em>s and <em>Handle Animal Skill</em>.)</li>

          <li>Animals breathe, eat, and sleep.</li>

          <p>This special sense allows a creature to detect approaching enemies,
          sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the
          scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar
          sights.</p><p>The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by
          sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60
          feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke
          or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above.
          Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be
          detected at triple the normal range.</p><p>When a creature detects a
          scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its
          presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a move action
          to note the direction of the scent. When the creature is within 5 feet
          of the source, it pinpoints the source’s location.</p><p>A creature
          with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, attempting a Wisdom
          or Survival check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a
          fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent).
          This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s
          odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each
          hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. Creatures tracking
          by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
          The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival
          skill.</p><p><em>Format:</em> scent</p><p><em>Location:</em>

        <p>Wandering alone or in packs, wolves sit at the top of the food chain.
        Ferociously territorial and exceptionally wide-ranging in their hunting,
        wolf packs cover broad areas. A wolf’s wide paws contain slight webbing
        between the toes that assists in moving over snow, and its fur is a
        thick, water-resistant coat ranging in color from gray to brown and even
        black in some species. Its paws contain scent glands that mark the
        ground as it travels, assisting in navigation as well as broadcasting
        its whereabouts to fellow pack members. Generally, a wolf stands from
        2-1/2 to 3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs between 45 and 150
        pounds, with females being slightly smaller.</p>
