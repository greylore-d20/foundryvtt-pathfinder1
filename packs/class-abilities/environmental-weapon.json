      "value": "<p>When the vigilante gains this talent, he must select one type of terrain from the ranger’s list of favored terrains. While in this terrain, as a swift action the vigilante can find an improvised weapon if there are any loose or moveable objects around (subject to the GM’s discretion). He doesn’t take a penalty for using these improvised weapons. For example, if the vigilante selected the urban environment, he might attack a foe with a chair, an empty bottle, or even a door.</p>\n<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the vigilante can select an additional type of terrain.</p>"
