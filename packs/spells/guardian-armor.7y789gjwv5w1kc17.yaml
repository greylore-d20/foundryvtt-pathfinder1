  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell teleports the suit of armor you are wearing off of your body
      and onto an ally within range; the target must be the same size and
      general shape as you. This armor appears on the target's body fully formed
      and properly donned, granting the creature the immediate benefit of its
      protection. If the target of <i>guardian armor</i> was already wearing
      armor, the armor wearing it is removed from the target's body and falls
      undamaged into an adjacent square.</p>
