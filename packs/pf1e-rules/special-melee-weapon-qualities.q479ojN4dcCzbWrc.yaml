        be placed on melee weapons. Once per round, when the wielder damages a
        creature in melee with an<em>advancing</em>weapon, she can take a 5-foot
        step as a swift action after the attack but before the end of her turn.
        This movement does not count against her ability to move or take a
        5-foot step earlier or later in the round, though using this ability
        imposes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next
        turn. This ability may not be used in conjunction with any other ability
        or effect that allows moving as part of an
        attack.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        chooses how to allocate her weapon’s enhancement bonus. The bonus to the

        special ability can only be added to a melee weapon or a thrown weapon.
        An <em>anchoring </em>weapon pins a target in place and prevents it from
        moving. As a swift action, the weapon can be fixed in place in a point
        in space, functioning as an <em>immovable rod</em>. This ability can
        also be used when the wielder hits a creature with a melee attack using
        an <em>anchoring </em>weapon. This anchors the target to the weapon,
        preventing it from moving away from the weapon. The target is not
        entangled or paralyzed; it simply cannot move from its location without
        first destroying the weapon or making a successful DC 30 Strength check
        as a full-round action to move with the weapon up to 10 feet. An
        <em>anchoring </em>weapon remains motionless and cannot be used to
        attack while it is anchoring a creature. An <em>anchoring </em>weapon
        has no effect on amorphous creatures, including elementals, oozes, and
        creatures in gaseous or liquid form. It also cannot anchor incorporeal
        creatures unless the weapon also has the <em>ghost touch </em>special
        ability.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        weapon causes an unattended flammable object to ignite when struck
        (Fortitude DC 13 negates for magic items), dealing 1d6+1 points of fire
        damage to the object each round after it’s ignited. An item made mostly
        or entirely out of wood is even more susceptible to this effect, taking
        2d6+2 points of fire damage. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A
        creature that ends its turn in the same space as a burning object takes
        1d6+1 points of fire damage.</p><p>Up to three times per day, the bearer
        of a <em>burning</em> weapon can, on command, cause a single object that
        has been ignited by the weapon to burn even brighter, increasing the
        duration of its burning effect by 1d4+1 rounds and causing the fire to
        expand in a burst that extends 5 feet from the object. This burst of
        fire deals 1d6+1 points of fire damage to each creature in that area,

        <strong>Weight</strong>—</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This special ability
        can be placed only on a light or one-handed melee weapon. A
        <em>concealed</em> weapon alters its shape at its wielder’s command,
        transforming into a non-weapon object of the wielder’s choice. This
        object must be a mundane item whose size and shape is similar to that of
        the concealed weapon or smaller, and it must be sized for a creature of
        the same size as the weapon’s intended wielder. For example, a Medium
        short sword can transform into a quill sized for a Medium creature, but
        it cannot transform into a saw sized for a Small creature. A
        <em>concealed</em> weapon cannot transform into a consumable item, and
        if its alternate form is that of a container, any contents stored within
        the concealed weapon’s alternate form are ejected into the wielder’s
        space when the weapon transforms back to its original form.<br /><br
        />While transformed, a <em>concealed</em> weapon doesn’t register as
        magical, as per <em>magic aura</em>, though it retains the weight, hit
        points, and any hardness of its original form. A <em>concealed</em>
        weapon cannot assume the form of an object made from a special material
        (such as adamantine) unless it is already made of that material. For
        instance, a wooden club cannot transform into a mithral frying pan, but
        a mithral dagger can.<br /><br />Transforming a <em>concealed</em>
        weapon into a mundane form requires a standard action, while returning
        it to its weapon form requires a move action. This transformation lasts
        until it is changed back into its original form or has been left
        unattended for 8 hours, whichever comes
        sooner.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        bloodline power, oracle’s mystery revelation, or wizard’s arcane school
        power). When the wielder makes a successful attack of the appropriate
        type, he may choose to expend two uses of his magical ability to channel
        it through the weapon to the struck opponent, which suffers the effects
        of both the weapon attack and the special ability. (If the wielder has
        unlimited uses of a special ability, she may channel through the weapon
        every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with
        her <em>conductive greatsword</em> can expend two uses of her lay on
        hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal both
        greatsword damage and damage from one use of lay on hands. A given
        character can use this weapon special ability only once per round (even
        if she has several <em>conductive</em> weapons), and the power works

        fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed it
        and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity,
        and the activating character it is not considered armed with the weapon.
        The weapon is considered wielded or attended by the activating character
        for all maneuvers and effects that target items. While dancing, the
        weapon shares the same space as the activating character and can attack
        adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet
        away). The <em>dancing</em> weapon accompanies the activating character
        everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the
        activating character has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it

        to channeled positive and negative energy. When the wielder spends a
        swift action to channel energy through the weapon, it ignites with a
        strange gray flame that sheds light as a torch, increases the weapon’s
        enhancement bonus by +1, and deals +1d6 damage (as the divine power from
        <em>flame strike</em>) to creatures struck by the weapon. This flame
        lasts for 1 round for every d6 of damage or healing the channeling
        normally provides. When charged with positive energy, the flame is a
        silvery gray, good creatures are immune to the weapon’s extra damage,
        and the weapon counts as a good and silver weapon for the purpose of
        bypassing damage reduction. When charged with negative energy, the flame
        is an ashen gray, evil creatures are immune to the weapon’s extra
        damage, and the weapon counts as an evil and cold iron weapon for the
        purpose of bypassing damage reduction. This special ability can only be
        placed on melee
        weapons.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft

        bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon. The bonus on
        saving throws lasts until his next turn. Only the weapon’s own
        enhancement bonus can be sacrificed, not any enhancement bonus provided
        by other effects such as a <em>greater magic weapon</em> spell. However,
        the total of such effects is still diminished by the amount allocated to
        improving saving throws.<br /><br />If a weapon has both the
        <em>defending</em> and <em>guardian</em> abilities, allocating a single

        but they strike at precisely the right moment to maximize damage if in
        the hands of a particularly wise wielder. A character who attacks with a
        guided weapon modifies his attack rolls and weapon damage rolls with his
        Wisdom modifier, not his Strength modifier. This modifier to damage is
        not adjusted for two-handed weapons or off-hand weapons—it always
        remains equal to the wielder’s Wisdom modifier. A guided weapon may be
        wielded as a normal weapon, using Strength to modify attack and damage
        rolls, but this goes against the weapon’s nature and imparts a –2
        penalty on all attack rolls made in this

        instead. If neither exhausted nor fatigued, the wielder gains a +2

        <strong>Weight</strong>—</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A <em>negating</em>
        weapon briefly nullifies some forms of damage reduction when it damages
        a creature. Whenever a <em>negating</em> weapon damages a foe with
        DR/chaotic, DR/evil, DR/good, DR/lawful, or DR/magic, it reduces the
        value of that damage reduction by 5 points for 1 round. For example, a
        <em>+1 negating lance</em> hitting a creature with DR 10/good and lawful
        reduces the creature’s DR to 5/good and lawful. If the creature has a
        component to its damage reduction other than the alignment types listed
        above, that component is unaffected. Thus, if the <em>+1 negating
        lance</em> above hits a demon with DR 10/good and cold iron, it would
        leave the demon with DR 10/cold iron and 5/good for 1 round. The effects
        of multiple <em>negating</em> weapons (or multiple hits from the same
        weapon) do not stack. This ability can only be placed on melee
        weapons.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft
