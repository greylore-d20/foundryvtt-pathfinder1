This functions as the slumber hex.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the restless nature of the sleep causes the creature to violently toss and turn, dealing 1d10 points of damage to itself each turn. This damage does not wake the creature.</p>\n<p>When it wakes, the creature’s addled state causes it to be confused for a number of rounds equal to half the witch’s level.</p>\n<p>The witch must have the slumber hex to select this hex.</p>"
