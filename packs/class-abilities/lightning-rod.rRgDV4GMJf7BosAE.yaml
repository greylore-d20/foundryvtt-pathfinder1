  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action when you cast a spell with the electricity
      descriptor, you can designate one creature within line of sight. The
      spellâ€™s damage against that creature increases by 50%, as if affected by
      the Empower Spell feat. This additional damage results from divine power
      that is not subject to being reduced by electricity resistance, and you
      take an equal amount of electricity damage immediately after you cast the
      spell. The spell can deal this additional damage only once, even if it
      could affect the target multiple times. You can use this ability once per
      day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every 4 cleric levels
      you have beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Electricity Resistance power granted by the Air
      Domain.</p>
