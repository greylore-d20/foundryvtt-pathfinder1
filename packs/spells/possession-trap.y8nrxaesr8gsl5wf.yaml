  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You place a protective ward over your spirit that ensnares creatures
    attempting to possess you. Should a creature attempt to possess you (such as
    via <i>magic jar</i> or a similar effect) while you are under the effects of
    <i>possession trap</i>, that creature must first succeed at a Will save or
    its possession attempt is ruined and its spirit is shunted into this spell's
    focus gem. The trapped creature is contained within the focus gem for 1
    round per caster level, acting as though it were trapped in a <i>magic
    jar</i> for the duration of this effect. This effect fails if you are not
    carrying the focus gem during the time of the possession attempt.</p><p>If
    the possessor's Will save is successful, you are affected by its possession
    attempt as normal, and may attempt a saving throw against this possession
    attempt if one is normally allowed. Regardless of whether the possessor
    fails or succeeds at its save against <i>possession trap</i>, you
    immediately become aware of the possession attempt and whether or not a
    creature is trapped in the focus gem. If the focus gem is destroyed while it
    contains a creature, the creature is immediately released.</p><p>Once this
    spell is triggered, it offers no further protection, and a trapped creature
    can attempt to possess you again once it's free of the focus gem.</p>
