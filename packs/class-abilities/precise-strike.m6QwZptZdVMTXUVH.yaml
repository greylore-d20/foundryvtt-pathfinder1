  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, a swashbuckler
      gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing
      melee weapon (though not natural weapon attacks), adding her swashbuckler
      level to the damage dealt. To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack
      with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She
      can even use this ability with thrown light or onehanded piercing melee
      weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that
      is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by
      precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from
      critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a
      precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't
      multiplied on a critical hit.</p><p>As a swift action, a swashbuckler can
      spend 1 panache point to double her precise strike's damage bonus on the
      next attack. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it
      is lost. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that
      reduces the amount of panache points a deed costs (such as the Signature
      Deed feat).</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
      <em>Panache</em> class feature</p>
