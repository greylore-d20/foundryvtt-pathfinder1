  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can protect herself from energy damage as a standard
      action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. She must pick one
      energy type and gains resistance 10 against that energy type for 1 minute
      per arcanist level. This protection increases by 5 for every 5 levels the
      arcanist possesses (up to a maximum of 30 at 20th level).</p>
