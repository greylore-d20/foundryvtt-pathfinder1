      <p>An eidolon gains the ability to inflict bleeding wounds. Select one
      type of attack. Attacks of that type deal 1d6 points of bleed damage.</p>

      <p>This evolution can be selected more than once. Each time an eidolon
      selects this evolution, it applies to a different attack. The bleed effect
      doesnâ€™t stack.</p>
