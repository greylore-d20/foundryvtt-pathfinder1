  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against
      obfuscating effects, hunter's eye greatly enhances your senses against the
      target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target when it is
      invisible or ethereal as though using the <i>see <i>invisibility</i></i>
      spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on Perception checks to locate
      the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist, <i>blur</i>,
      <i>displacement</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, and similar effects affecting
      the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. This spell provides
      no benefits to your allies, and no benefits against creatures other than
      the target.</p>
