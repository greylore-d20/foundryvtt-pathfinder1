  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his <em>Wisdom</em>
      bonus (if any) to his <em>AC</em> and his <em>CMD</em>. In addition, a
      monk gains a +1 bonus to <em>AC</em> and <em>CMD</em> at 4th level. This
      bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a
      maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>

      <p>These bonuses to <em>AC</em> apply even against touch attacks or when
      the monk is <em>flat-footed</em>. He loses these bonuses <span
      class="notImp" title="Not Implemented">when he is immobilized or
      <em>helpless</em></span>, when he wears any <em>armor</em>, when he
      carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
