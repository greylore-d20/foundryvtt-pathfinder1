    value: >-
      <p>The target takes on the form of a half-elf from the surface world. Its
      skin, hair, and eyes change to match a specific human ethnicity. You can
      even change the target's facial features or produce light facial hair or
      stubble. The target loses its darkvision, light blindness, and light
      sensitivity traits, if it normally has them. The target gains low-light
      vision; a +3 racial bonus on a single Craft, Knowledge, Perform, or
      Profession skill of its choice; and both a +4 bonus on Bluff checks and a
      +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass itself off as a half-elf.</p>
