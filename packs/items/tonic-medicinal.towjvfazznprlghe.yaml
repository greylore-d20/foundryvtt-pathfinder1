  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This mild sedative is normally used to treat insomnia, making the
      drinker reluctant to take hasty actions but adept at remaining still or
      silent. One cup of the tonic gives a <em>halfling</em> a -4 penalty on
      <em>initiative</em> checks for 10 minutes and a +2 <em>alchemical
      bonus</em> on <em>Stealth</em> checks for that
      time.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Non-<em>halflings</em> do not receive
      any bonuses from this drink.</p>
