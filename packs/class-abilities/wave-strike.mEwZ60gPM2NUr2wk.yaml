  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the shaman can perform a melee touch attack that
      drenches a creature and pushes it away. The opponent takes 1d6 points of
      nonlethal damage + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels they possess and is
      pushed 5 feet directly away from the shaman. This movement does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      her Charisma modifier.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, any melee weapon she wields is treated as if it had the
      quenching weapon special ability.</p>
