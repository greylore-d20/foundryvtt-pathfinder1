    value: >-
      <p>You partition your mind to maximize your mental power. Until the spell
      ends, you roll twice and use the higher result for all Will saves,
      Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks. In addition, as
      a swift action you can have your second mind perform any purely mental
      action that normally requires a standard action or a move action. This
      includes casting psychic spells, using spell-like abilities, and
      concentrating on spells. Spells and spell-like abilities cast or used by
      your secondary mind this way can't exceed 5th level.</p>
