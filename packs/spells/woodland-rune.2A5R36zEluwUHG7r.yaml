      <p>Created by Ghorus as a safety measure to limit his enemies’ movements,
      this spell allows you to inscribe a powerful rune on any surface. Woodland
      rune triggers when any non-plant creature (apart from the caster) moves
      within 30 feet of the rune. When it’s triggered, roots and branches sprout
      from the ground, catching all creatures within a 30-foot burst of the rune
      and hindering their movement as if they were moving through <em>heavy
      undergrowth</em>, though it does not provide concealment. Plant creatures
      and creatures under the effect of
      @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.5iXq1igb1Cq0qobT]{woodland stride} or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.lvzq2mwkqmozolpl]{freedom of movement} are not
      affected by this spell. In all other respects, this spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death}.</p>
