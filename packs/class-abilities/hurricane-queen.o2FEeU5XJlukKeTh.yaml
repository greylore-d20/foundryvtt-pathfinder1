      <p>You are one with the hurricane. Your enveloping winds defense wild
      talent has an additional 25% chance of deflecting nonmagical ranged
      attacks, and your total deflection chance can exceed the usual cap of
      75%.</p>

      <p>All wind and weather (including creatures using the whirlwind monster
      ability) affect you and your attacks only if you wish them to do so; for
      example, you could shoot arrows directly through a tornado without
      penalty.</p>
