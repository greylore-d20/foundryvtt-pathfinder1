      <p>The shaman can invoke an ancestor spirit into an intact, humanoid or
      monstrous humanoid corpse to learn what the body knew in life. The acts as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.byn5q46du0ck592a]{Speak with Dead}, but the shaman
      may ask only a single question. If an animated corpse or undead is
      targeted with this ability, the hex immediately fails.</p>
