  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can assume
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous Form} (as the spell). You
      can remain gaseous for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration
      does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute
      increments.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation. You can bring
      other creatures with you in gaseous form, but each passenger costs an
      additional minute per minute of travel.</p>
