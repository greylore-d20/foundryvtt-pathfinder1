    value: >-
      <p>When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or
      locating the target and also renders the affected target invisible (as the
      <i>invisibility</i> spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from
      being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices.
      Creatures affected by <i>sequester</i> become comatose and are effectively
      in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.</p><p><i>Note:</i>
      The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being
      <i>sequester</i>ed. There is no save to see the <i>sequester</i>ed
      creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.</p>
