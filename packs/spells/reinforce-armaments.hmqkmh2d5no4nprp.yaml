    value: >-
      <p>You reinforce a weapon or armor suit to give it a temporarily upgrade
      or mitigate the fragile quality (see page 146). A suit of armor or weapon
      touched that has the fragile quality is not considered to have the fragile
      quality for the spell's duration. Normal armor suits or weapons subjected
      to this spell instead gain the masterwork quality for the spell's duration
      and their hardness is doubled. If this spell is cast on masterwork or
      magical armor or weapons, their hardness is doubled for the duration of
      the spell.</p>
