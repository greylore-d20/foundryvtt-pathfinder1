    value: >-
      <p>You cause a cloak, shawl, poncho, or other outer garment you are
      wearing to animate to aid and defend you. The cloak provides a +2 shield
      bonus to your AC. In addition, once each round during your turn, you can
      take a free action to direct your cloak to use the aid another action to
      assist your skill check, attack roll, or AC. The cloak has an attack bonus
      or a total skill bonus equal to your caster level plus your key
      spellcasting ability score modifier (Charisma for bards, Intelligence for
      wizards, and so on). If another creature dons the cloak during the
      duration, the cloak provides its protection and aid to the wearer, but it
      still uses the same bonus on the aid another actions as if you were the
      wearer. The cloak cannot take any other type of action.</p>
