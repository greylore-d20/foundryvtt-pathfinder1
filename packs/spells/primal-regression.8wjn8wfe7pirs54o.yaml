    value: >-
      <p>This spell sequesters the targets' ability for higher reasoning,
      allowing their darker impulses to come to the fore. An affected target
      becomes a ravening monster-savage, bloodthirsty, and brutish. Until the
      spell ends, the targets have all of the following benefits and drawbacks.
      </p><ul><li> Targets' Intelligence and Charisma scores drop to 3 (if the
      scores were higher), and they are unable to use Intelligence-or
      Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate
      coherently. </li><li> Targets take a -4 penalty on Will saves. </li><li>
      Targets gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 natural armor bonus
      to AC, and 2d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear
      at the end of the spell's duration. </li></ul> When the spell ends, each
      affected creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or take 1d4 points
      of Intelligence drain and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.<p></p>
