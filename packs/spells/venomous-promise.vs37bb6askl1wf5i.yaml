      <p>You guard your words and person with poisonous power. You can impart a
      short amount of information-up to 25 words-as you cast this spell,
      entwining your words with the poison provided as a material component. If
      your target reveals the information you impart (verbally, in writing, with
      gestures, or by having its mind read with spells like <i>detect</i>
      thoughts), the target is immediately exposed to the poison (and is allowed
      any saving throw the poison allows).  Your target instinctively knows that
      revealing this information will endanger it, but doesn't automatically
      understand why or how. <i>Neutralize poison</i> removes the effect of this
      spell; the spellcaster must succeed at a caster level check against the
      spell's save DC rather than the poison's.</p>
