  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist’s rasugen now grants a +4 alchemical bonus on all saving
      throws, 3 temporary hit points per alchemist level, and immunity to
      mindaffecting effects. The alchemist takes a –4 penalty to Intelligence as
      long as the greater rasugen persists.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 12th level and able to brew a rasugen
      before selecting this discovery.</p>
