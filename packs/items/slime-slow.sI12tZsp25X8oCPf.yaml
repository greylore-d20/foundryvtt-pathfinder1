      <p>Dark blue crystals are suspended at various points in this chunky
      mixture of icy liquid. When the liquid inside is exposed to open air, a
      vial of slow slime has a unique congealing effect on amorphous bodies. The
      wielder can throw a vial of slime slow as a splash weapon. If a creature
      with the amorphous special quality suffers a direct hit, that creature
      must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or lose the benefits of being
      amorphous for 1d4 rounds. Amorphous creatures indirectly hit by slime slow
      must attempt the same Fortitude save, but only risk losing the benefits of
      being amorphous for 1 round. Crafting a vial of slime slow requires a
      successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>
