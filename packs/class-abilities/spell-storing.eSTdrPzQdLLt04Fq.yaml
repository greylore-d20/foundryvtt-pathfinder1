    value: >-
      <p><strong>Source</strong> Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 7</p><p>The rogue can
      store within himself a single targeted harmless spell of up to 2nd level.
      The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action. Anytime a spell
      that meets these conditions is cast on the rogue, and he does not already
      have a spell stored, he can choose to store it rather than have it take
      effect immediately. Anytime afterward, as a standard action, the rogue can
      have the spell take effect (acting in all ways as if it had just been cast
      on him). A rogue must have 1 rank of Use Magic Device to select this
      talent.</p>
