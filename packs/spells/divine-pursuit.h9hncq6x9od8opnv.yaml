  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Select one creature within 60 feet that you have damaged. If that
      creature has a burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed, you gain that form of
      movement for the duration of the spell at the same speed and
      maneuverability as the selected creature. If this gives you the burrow or
      swim speed, you can breathe while burrowing or swimming. If the creature
      moves 1,000 feet or more from you, the spell ends. If the creature has
      more than one of these types of movement, you select one from the types
      available to the creature.</p>
