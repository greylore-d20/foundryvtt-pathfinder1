  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a <em>standard action</em>, you can generate a blast of air that
      hurls an unattended object (or objects) or an object in your possession up
      to 30 feet in a straight line. If you have a free hand, you can catch an
      object hurled toward yourself. You can move objects weighing up to 1 pound
      per wizard level. Objects are not thrown with enough force to cause
      damage, although fragile objects like alchemical weapons shatter on
      contact with a creature or hard surface. To hit a creature with an object,
      you must succeed at a ranged <em>touch attack</em>. You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Intelligence</em>
      modifier.</p>
