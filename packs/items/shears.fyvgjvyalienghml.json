Small shears can be used in one hand and are often used to trim hair, cut cloth, or perform other delicate cutting work. Lopping shears are 3 feet long and must be used in two hands; they are commonly used by farmers or gardeners to cut hedges and branches.</p>\n<p><em>Adamantine</em> shears are lopping shears with sharpened <em>adamantine</em> blades that can snip through nearly any material.</p>\n<p>You can use <em>adamantine</em> shears to cut through bars, chains, grates, or similar items, dealing damage to such objects as though using a <em>scimitar</em> and bypassing <em>hardness</em> less than 20.</p>\n<p>On any item the <em>adamantine</em> shears can fit around (such as a <em>chain</em> or iron bar, but not an iron door), using <em>adamantine</em> shears provides a +10 bonus on your <em>Strength</em> check to break or burst it.</p>"
