      "value": "<p>A rogue with this talent can attempt to spread a rumor though a small town or larger settlement by making a Bluff check. She can do so a number of times per week equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The DC is based on the size of the settlement, and it takes a week for the rumor to propagate through the settlement. If the check succeeds, the rumor is practically accepted as fact within the community; succeeding by 5 or more over the DC decreases the time it takes the rumor to propagate by 1d4 days. A failed check means the rumor failed to gain traction, while failing by 5 or more causes the opposite of the rumor or some other competing theory involving the rumorâ€™s subject to take hold.<br><br></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Community Size</b></td>\n<td><b>DC</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small town</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large town</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small city</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large city</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metropolis</td>\n<td>35<p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
