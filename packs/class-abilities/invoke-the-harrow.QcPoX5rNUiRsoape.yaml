    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you can draw a random harrow card from a complete harrow
      deck you own as a <em>standard action</em> and channel the aspects of the
      card into your body. You take on superficial traits featured on the card
      and gain a +4 <em>enhancement bonus</em> to the ability score associated
      with the cardâ€™s suit. You can invoke the harrow for a number of minutes
      per day equal to your <em>sorcerer</em> level; the duration need not be
      continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
