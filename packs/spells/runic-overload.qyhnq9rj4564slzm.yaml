      <p>This spell charges magical runes to an explosive degree. If cast on a
      creature with magical runes on its body, such as a rune giant or a
      runescarred creature (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Lost Cities
      of Golarion</i> 60), it deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level
      (maximum 20d6) to the target and stuns the target for 1 round. When the
      spell is cast in this way, it must overcome the target's spell resistance.
      A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the stun effect.  The
      spell can also be cast on other magical runes, such as those from
      <i>arcane mark</i> or <i>explosive runes</i>. In this case, the resulting
      explosion deals 1d8 points of sonic damage per  2 caster levels (maximum
      10d8) to all creatures within a 5-foot radius. Creatures in the area that
      succeed at a Reflex save take half damage. This spell doesn't destroy
      runes; targeted runes continue to function normally. Mundane runes, such
      as ones in writing or runic tattoos, cannot be affected by this spell.</p>
