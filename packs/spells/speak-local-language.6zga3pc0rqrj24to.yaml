  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>tongues</i>, except the creature touched
      gains only the ability to speak and understand a regional human language,
      such as Varisian or Common (Taldane in the Inner Sea region or Tien in
      Tian Xia), and the language granted must be one you know. You must select
      the language at the time of casting. The language can't be a dead
      language, such as Ancient Osiriani or Jistka. The target speaks the
      language with a native accent, but the spell doesn't impart knowledge
      about any culture associated with the language, nor does it change the
      target's appearance.</p>
