  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You are cloaked in an illusion of authority. Others perceive you to be a
    legitimate figure of authority, such as a higher-ranking official, a
    religious figure, or a more powerful warrior. This illusion grants you a +5
    bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. If you attempt to disguise
    yourself as a specific authority figure whom you have met in person, you
    gain a +10 competence bonus on the Disguise check and any Bluff  check
    related to impersonating that authority figure.</p><p>In addition, others
    are uncomfortable acting against you. Creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or
    more take a –2 penalty on all opposed checks made against you, such as Sense
    Motive checks made to determine if you’re bluffing, or Perception checks
    made to notice you when you’re using Stealth to sneak (a result of their not
    wanting to question whether you belong there, and thus giving you the
    benefit of the doubt).</p>
