      <p>Useful on any terrain where traction may be a concern, cleats are shoes
      with spikes or hooks attached to the soles. Cleats reduce the penalty for
      walking over slick surfaces by 50%; for example, walking across ice
      normally costs 2 squares for every square of movement, but with cleats it
      costs only 1.5 squares for every square. Cleats cause damage to any type
      of finished flooring.</p>
