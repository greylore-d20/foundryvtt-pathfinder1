      <p>As a swift action, a ninja with this trick can pass through walls as if
      she were a ghost. Until the end of her turn, she can pass through a wall
      or other surface that is up to 5 feet thick per level as if she were
      incorporeal. She must exit the solid material by the end of her turn. Each
      use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p>
