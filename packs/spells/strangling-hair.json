    "shortDescription": "<p>Your hair animates and extends to grapple and constrict an opponent. Make a grapple check against the target using your caster level as the base attack bonus plus a bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma bonus (if a sorcerer). This grapple check does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If your hair succeeds in grappling a foe, that creature takes 1d6 points of damage or your unarmed strike damage, whichever is greater, and gains the grappled condition. Your hair receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that your hair succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. The CMD of your hair, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.  Once you choose a target, your hair continues to attack that target independently of your own actions. You may designate a new target as a move action, which causes your hair to release its current target (if any) and attack the new target that round. Your hair cannot be targeted as a separate creature, but it can be dispelled.</p>",
