Success allows the rogue to add an amount damage equal to her Dexterity modifier to the attack’s damage. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A creature immune to sneak attacks is immune to this additional damage. A rogue must be trained in Fly to select this talent.</p>"
