  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a wasp swarm (<i>Bestiary</i> 275), which fills your space
      (up to 5 feet by 5 feet) but does not attack you. The dense cloud of
      vermin gives you partial concealment against ranged attacks. Any creature
      that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 points of swarm
      damage and poison from the wasp swarm, but is not affected by the swarm's
      distraction ability. As a free action on your turn, you may have the swarm
      cling to you tightly, giving you a fly speed of 20 feet (poor
      maneuverability); when using the swarm to fly, it does not provide
      concealment or harm creatures that strike you. You can return the swarm to
      its protective shape as a free action on your turn.</p>
