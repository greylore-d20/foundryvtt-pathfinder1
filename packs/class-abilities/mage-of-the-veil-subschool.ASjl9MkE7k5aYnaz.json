      "value": "<p>Rather than controlling the elements or transforming the environment, mages of the veil focus on much more subtle magicâ€”blending into their surroundings to watch, observe, and gather secrets, or fading from view completely for the sake of solitude. Most graduates of this college become spies, scouts, or infiltrators.</p>\n<p><b>Associated School:</b> <em>Illusion</em>.</p>\n<p><b>Requirements:</b> A mage of the veil must select <em>disguise self</em> as one of his spells known at 1st level.</p>\n<p><b>Class Skills:</b> A mage of the veil gains <em>Bluff</em>, <em>Disguise</em>, and <em>Stealth</em> as class skills.</p>\n<p><b>Replacement Powers:</b> This subschool replaces the blinding ray and invisibility field powers of the <em>illusion</em> school.</p>"
