Each time you activate this ability, it lasts until you have taken a number of tree steps equal to your kineticist level, your burn is removed, or you accept burn again to refresh it.</p>\n<p>Each time your burn is removed, you can automatically activate this ability once and ignore the burn cost. You can accept 1 additional point of burn while this ability is active to use all remaining tree steps at once, adding up the total distance traveled and instantly reaching your destination tree even if there wouldnâ€™t have been enough trees along the way to make the journey one at a time.</p>"
