      "value": "<p>The following rogue talent is available to drow rogues. Particularly deft rogues can strike two foes with one well-placed shot. As a standard action, a rogue with this talent can fire a hand crossbow at an enemy who is granted cover by another opponent. Make one ranged attack roll and compare the result to each opponentâ€™s AC. Each hit deals 1 point of damage. Any special weapon properties or precision damage apply to only a single target, but any poison applied to the bolt affects all targets struck. An unchained rogue can select this talent.</p>"
