      "value": "<p>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a <em>standard action</em>, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his <em>Survival</em> <em>skill checks</em> while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 <em>insight bonus</em> on <em>attack rolls</em> made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creatureâ€™s type must correspond to one of his <em>favored enemy</em> types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a <em>free action</em>, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is <em>dead</em>, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>"
