  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell infuses a weapon with pure sunlight (the weapon need not be
      a bladed weapon). A weapon enhanced by this spell sheds light as if
      <i>daylight</i> had been cast on it. It functions as a magic and good
      weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. The weapon grants
      a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls against undead and deals +1d6 points of
      damage on a successful hit against such foes; against incorporeal undead,
      it functions as if it had the <i>ghost touch</i> weapon special ability.
      The weapon automatically confirms critical hits against foes that are
      vulnerable to sunlight.</p>
