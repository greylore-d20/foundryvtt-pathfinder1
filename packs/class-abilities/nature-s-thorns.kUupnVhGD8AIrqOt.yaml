    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, creatures that hit you in melee (other than those using
      manufactured reach weapons) take 4d6 points of piercing damage. A creature
      takes this damage only on its first successful attack against you in a
      combat round, and not on subsequent attacks in that round.</p>
