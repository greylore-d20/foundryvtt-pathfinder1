  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but
    yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move).
    The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature
    approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it
    is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they
    activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It
    does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.</p><p>If
    an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking
    and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing
    damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an
    invisible creature (see <i>invisibility).</i></p><p>The dog is considered
    ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's
    turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage
    reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.</p><p>The
    spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking,
    it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet
    distant from the hound, the spell ends.</p>
