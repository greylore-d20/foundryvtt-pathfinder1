  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a living creature of wood.
      She is forevermore treated as a plant creature rather than her original
      creature type for the purposes of spells and magical effects. Her skin
      takes on the appearance of polished wood grain, and she gains a +4 natural
      armor bonus to her Armor Class and damage reduction 10/â€” against wooden
      weapons and the natural attacks of wooden and wood-like creatures. She
      gains immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun.</p>

      <p>At will, the shaman can meld with any tree or single block of wood (as
      per meld into stone, except she can meld only with wood and has no limit
      on how long she can remain in the wood).</p>
