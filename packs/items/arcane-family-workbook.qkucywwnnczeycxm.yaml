    value: >-
      <p><em>The elven predilection for becoming wizards and the social benefits
      that elven wizards enjoy often encourages families to dedicate themselves
      to wizardly studies for multiple generations. Older elven wizards take
      note of their own insights into the secrets of arcane magic and compile
      these thoughts with the ideas of earlier generations to form family
      workbooks.</em></p><p>When used as a reference (an action that typically
      takes 1d4 full rounds of searching the text), an arcane family workbook
      grants a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on a <em>Spellcraft</em> checks.
      This bonus increases to +4 if 1d4 hours are spent referencing the
      book.</p>
