  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an instinctual connection between the targets. Each can
      sense the others' overall emotional states, which allows them to
      communicate basic emotional concepts (such as alerting each other of
      danger due to increased stress). Once the spell has been cast on the
      subjects, the distance between them and the caster doesn't affect the
      spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject
      leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.</p>
