      <p>This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single
      stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike <i>lightning bolt</i>,
      <i>chain lightning</i> strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs
      to other targets.</p><p>The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage
      per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes,
      lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster
      level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as
      much damage as the primary bolt.</p><p>Each target can attempt a Reflex
      saving throw for half damage.</p><p>The Reflex DC to halve the damage of
      the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the
      primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all
      be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more
      than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the
      maximum.</p>
