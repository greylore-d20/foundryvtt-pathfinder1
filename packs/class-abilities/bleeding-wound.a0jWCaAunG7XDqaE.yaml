  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a
      firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a free action to have that
      attack deal extra bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the
      gunslinger’s Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2
      grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed
      damage (gunslinger’s choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak
      attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.</p>
