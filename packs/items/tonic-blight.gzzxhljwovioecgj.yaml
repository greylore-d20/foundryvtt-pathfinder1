      <p>Blight tonic increases the potency of a creature's <em>disease</em>
      attack transmitted by physical contact, such as a <em>dire rat's</em>
      filth fever. The next time a creature must save against the drinker's
      <em>disease</em> save DC, the DC for the initial infection increases by
      +2. The tonic lasts for 10 minutes or until the next time a creature must
      save against the drinker's <em>disease</em> DC, whichever comes first.</p>
