  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement
    bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics,
    druids, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive owl's
    wisdom do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but
    the save DCs for their spells increase.</p>
