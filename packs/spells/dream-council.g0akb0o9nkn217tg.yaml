      <p>This spell functions as <i>dream</i>, but you and the target of your
      <i>dream</i> can converse in a limited fashion as long as the recipient is
      also asleep. You can send or receive a number of <i>dream</i> messages
      equal to your caster level. Each message can be up to 25 words long or a
      single vague image that can't convey fine details such as words. You can
      send and receive these <i>dream</i> messages with a single target or
      multiple targets, but each message you send or receive counts against the
      total number of messages allowed. Sending a message takes 1 round. The
      spell ends and you wake up when you run out of messages.  If you use
      <i>dream</i> council to send a message to a sleeping creature that has
      <i>dream</i> or <i>dream</i> council prepared (or is able to cast it
      spontaneously or as a spell-like ability), the recipient can expend one of
      your allotted messages to cast that spell while remaining asleep. This
      uses up that creature's prepared spell, spell per day, or spell-like
      ability use as normal. Instead of replying to your message, that character
      is able to enter your <i>dream</i>scape. If the sleeping recipient has the
      Lucid Dreamer feat, it can enter your <i>dream</i>scape without casting
      either of those spells. While in the original caster's <i>dream</i>scape,
      those involved in the council can interact with one another and that
      <i>dream</i>scape for 10 minutes for each message remaining. When that
      time elapses, the spell ends.</p>
