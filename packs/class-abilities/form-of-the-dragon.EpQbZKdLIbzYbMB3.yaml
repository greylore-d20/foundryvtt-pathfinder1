      <p><strong>Source</strong> Legacy of Dragons pg. 9</p><p>Your kinship with
      dragonkind allows you to take on the form of a dragon. As a standard
      action, you can assume the form of a Medium dragon, as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.iqcjiyi9leldfzxt]{Form of the Dragon I}.</p><p>At
      15th level, you can assume the form of a Large dragon, as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.5icj4nasrlgqojqm]{Form of the Dragon II}.</p><p>At
      19th level, you can assume the form of a Huge dragon, as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.6qpg42rj70oi4css]{Form of the Dragon
      III}.</p><p>You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 10
      minutes per oracle level.</p><p>If you are at least 15th level and choose
      to have this ability function as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.iqcjiyi9leldfzxt]{Form of the Dragon I}, the
      duration is instead 1 hour per oracle level.</p><p>You must be at least
      11th level to select this revelation. Rather than form of the dragon
      spells, you can choose for this revelation to act as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g3d29t4amz91ewy5]{Form Of The Alien Dragon I},
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.k59ax9hxy83o19bn]{Form Of The Alien Dragon II}, and
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.fv14vemq9gduhyhu]{Form Of The Alien Dragon III} or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.tjokidgeh3dy9mv0]{Form Of The Exotic Dragon I},
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gwyeoo4ksso71zfo]{Form Of The Exotic Dragon II},
      and @Compendium[pf1.spells.0nm8l17dcr7oi7c3]{Form Of The Exotic Dragon
      III}. This choice must be made when you first gain this revelation, and
      cannot be changed.</p>
