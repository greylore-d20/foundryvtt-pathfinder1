      "value": "<p>At 15th level, you can traverse vertical surfaces as easily as you walk on the ground. When climbing, you move at your normal land speed and take none of the penalties associated with climbing. The surface must be able to support your weight, and difficult terrain affects your speed as normal. You are also immune to @Compendium[pf1.spells.3bdfw5f15hwcxlth]{Reverse Gravity}&nbsp;and similar effects.</p>"
