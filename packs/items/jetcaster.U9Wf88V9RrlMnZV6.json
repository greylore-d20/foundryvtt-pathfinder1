When the wielder compresses the air bladders (a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity), the jetcaster sprays its ammunition in a 10-foot cone. Most adventurers use a jetcaster to spray powder over invisible foes or holy water over incorporeal undead, but it can also spray oil, itching powder, sneezing powder, or other mundane dusts and liquids.<p>Loading the ammunition bladder is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and requires either a 4-pint jug of liquid (weighing up to 4 pounds) or a 4-pound sack of powder; insufficient ammunition causes it to misfire harmlessly. Refilling the air bladders is a move action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. Readying and firing a jetcaster requires two hands.<p>If a jetcaster fires ordinary powder or oil, each square in the cone is coated in that substance. If a jetcaster fires holy water, itching powder, or sneezing powder, treat each square in the cone as a square of impact and each square adjacent to the cone (including the wielder’s) as an adjacent square for the purpose of determining effects and DCs. Loading a jetcaster with unstable compounds such as acid or alchemist’s fire destroys the device.</p>"
