  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The lightest of armors typically favored by samurai, do-maru wraps
      around the wearerâ€™s body like a short armored coat. It consists primarily
      of lamellar and lacks a solid breastplate or sleeves, leaving the
      shoulders and upper body somewhat exposed, but permitting the wearer
      greater flexibility than do the majority of heavier armors.</p>
