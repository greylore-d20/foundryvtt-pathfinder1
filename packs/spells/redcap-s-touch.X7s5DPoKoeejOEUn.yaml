  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You infuse the target with the blood used as a material component,
    imparting malicious power. As long as the hat is worn (occupying the
    wearerâ€™s head slot as though it were a magic item), it grants its wearer a
    +2 bonus on damage rolls and causes the wearer to regain 1d4 hit points
    whenever they deal the killing blow to a living creature.</p>
