      <p>A treasure chest is a common wooden chest treated with resin to make
      the wood water-resistant. Metal bands, usually bronze to prevent rusting,
      are strapped around the treasure chest for extra reinforcement, and the
      lock is also typically made of bronze. A treasure chest uses the
      statistics of an ordinary
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.AOuUAs1ll081PZVW]{wooden chest}, but its
      hit points increase by 25% and its break DC increases by 2. Treasure
      chests are waterproof and withstand being buried better than ordinary
      chests</p>
