  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A blast of hellfire blazes from your hands. You can fire one ray, plus
    one additional ray for every 4 caster levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of
    three rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit
    and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the
    damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from unholy power
    and is therefore not subject to being reduced by fire resistance. The rays
    can be fired at the same target or at different targets, but all rays must
    be fired simultaneously and aimed at targets within 30 feet of each
    other.</p><p>Any creature killed by this spell must attempt a Will saving
    throw; failure means the creature's soul is damned to Hell as a burst of
    brimstone appears around its corpse. A nonevil spellcaster attempting to
    bring the creature back from the dead  must attempt a caster level check (DC
    = 10 + the slain creature's level) to succeed; failure means the spellcaster
    cannot try again for 1 day. Evil spellcasters can raise the slain character
    normally, without requiring a check. A raised characterâ€™s soul is no longer
    automatically consigned to Hell.</p>
