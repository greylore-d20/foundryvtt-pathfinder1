  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single
      squeeze of the trigger. Because of its size and weight, you take a -4
      penalty on your attack roll if you're proficient with it, or -8 if you're
      not. If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical
      hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage apply to only
      the first bolt. Reloading one bolt is a standard action; the Rapid Reload
      feat reduces this to a move action. Crossbow Mastery (<em>Advanced
      Player's Guide</em>) allows you to reload both bolts as a move action. A
      double crossbow fires crossbow bolts.</p>
