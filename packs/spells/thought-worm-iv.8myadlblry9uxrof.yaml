      <p>This functions as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.3edtpx9oabq3oeeg]{thought worm III},
      except that the penalty on Will saves is -6 and a target that succeeds at
      its Will save still takes a -3 penalty on Will saves against your
      mind-affecting spells and effects for the same duration. This spell can be
      undercast.</p>
