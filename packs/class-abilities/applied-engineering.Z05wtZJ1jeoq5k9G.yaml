  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The investigator can leverage his knowledge of engineering to solve
      tasks that normally require brute strength or keen eyes. He can expend one
      use of inspiration as a full-round action to study an object or area and
      attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check. On his next turn, he can use the
      result of that Knowledge (engineering) check in place of a Strength check
      to break the object or in place of a Perception check to locate hidden
      doors or compartments in that area.</p>
