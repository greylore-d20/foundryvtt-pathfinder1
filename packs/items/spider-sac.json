      "value": "<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>\n<p>Despite their name, spider sacs have nothing to do with <em>spiders</em> but rather are alchemical devices with a unique delivery system. Used for climbing as well as combat, these grayish, gourd-like pouches are made of a specially grown fungus with a tough but rubbery exterior. The fungoid is carefully harvested, pierced at one end, hollowed out, and then injected with a strong alchemical adhesive that hardens to a fibrous material almost instantly when exposed to air. When squeezed, a spider sac's adhesive shoots out to a maximum range of 10 feet and sticks to whatever it strikes, whereupon the strand dries instantly into a durable fibrous rope. For the purposes of climbing, treat a spider sac as a grappling hook except that all surfaces are AC 5. A spider sac can also be used as a <em>lasso</em> except with AC 10, 4 <em>hit points</em>, and a DC 24 <em>Strength</em> check to burst. A spider sac is a single-use item.</p>"
