  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This extract causes you to take on a pale, sickly pallor for 1 round.
      During this time, if you consume a potion, it has no effect. Instead, your
      mouth fills with a vile poison that you can spit onto a weapon as a free
      action. If you do not spit out the poison in 1 round, it affects you
      instead. The effect of the poison depends on the level of spell contained
      in the potion consumed (see sidebar). If the poison is not used within 1
      minute per caster level it becomes inert. You can only create one dose of
      poison in this way per casting of this spell.</p>
