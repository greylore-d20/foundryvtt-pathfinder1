    "shortDescription": "<p><i>Dazzling blade</i> makes a weapon appear dazzlingly shiny, as if crafted from pure silver and heavily polished. In combat, the flashing movements of a <i>dazzling blade</i> become almost hypnotic. The wielder of a weapon under the effects of <i>dazzling blade</i> gains a +1 competence bonus on all Bluff checks made to feint in combat. The wielder also gains a +1 competence bonus on all CMB checks made to disarm a foe, and a +1 competence bonus to his CMD against disarm attempts made against the weapon bearing the <i>dazzling blade</i> effect. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 caster levels, to a maximum bonus of +5 at 12th level.</p><p>The wielder of a <i>dazzling blade</i> can discharge the spell into a blinding burst of silvery light as a free action. The wielder selects an adjacent opponent as the focal point of this burst of light-that creature must make a Will save to avoid being blinded for 1 round (with a successful save, the creature is instead dazzled for 1 round).</p><p>Despite its shiny appearance, a <i>dazzling blade</i> grants no extra benefit against creatures that are vulnerable to silver.</p>",
