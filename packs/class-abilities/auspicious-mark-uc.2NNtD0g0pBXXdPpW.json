As a swift action, she can call upon the spiritsâ€™ favor to increase any d20 roll she just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels she has. She can call on the auspicious mark after seeing the result of the d20 roll. This ability can be used only once per day.</p>"
