      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This musket has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be shot
      independently as separate attacks, or both can be fired at once as a
      standard action (the attack action).</p>

      <p>If both barrels are fired at once, they must both target the same
      creature or object, and the gun becomes wildly inaccurate, taking a -4
      penalty on each shot. Each barrel of a double-barreled musket uses either
      a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as
      ammunition.</p>
