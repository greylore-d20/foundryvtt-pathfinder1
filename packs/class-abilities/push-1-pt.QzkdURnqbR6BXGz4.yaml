  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon gains the ability to push creatures away with a successful
      attack. Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a
      successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat
      maneuver check. If successful, the target of the attack is pushed 5 feet
      directly away from the eidolon. This ability only works on creatures of a
      size equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures pushed in this way do
      not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not
      stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a
      different natural attack.</p>
