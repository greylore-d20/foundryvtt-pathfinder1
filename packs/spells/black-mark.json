The <i>black mark</i> functions as a <i>mark of justice</i>, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the <i>black mark</i> is active, the target is affected as if subject to nature's exile (Advanced Player's Guide 233), but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not.</p>",
