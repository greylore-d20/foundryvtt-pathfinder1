  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, your body undergoes an internal elemental
      shift, and you become a living conduit of the Elemental Planes. Your
      external appearance remains the same, although you may take on certain
      cosmetic elemental traits (such as smoldering hair or pebble-like skin).
      You become immune to critical hits and precision damage such as from sneak
      attacks. You no longer need to breathe, eat, or sleep.</p>
