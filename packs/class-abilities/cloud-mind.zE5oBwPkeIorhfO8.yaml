      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cloud
      the mind of one foe within 30 feet. That foe is dazed for 1 round if the
      number of Hit Dice it possesses is less than or equal to or your occultist
      level. If it has more Hit Dice than your occultist level, it is staggered
      for 1 round instead. The foe can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the
      effect.</p>

      <p>Whether or not it succeeds at the save, the target is then immune to
      this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
