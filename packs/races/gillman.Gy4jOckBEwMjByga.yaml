      Traits</h2><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers</strong>: Gillmen are
      vigorous and beautiful, but their domination by the <em>aboleths</em> has
      made them weak-willed. They gain +2 <em>Constitution</em>, +2
      <em>Charisma</em>, and –2 <em>Wisdom</em>.</li><li><strong>Type</strong>:
      Gillmen are <em>humanoids</em> with the <em>aquatic</em>
      subtype.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Gillmen are Medium creatures and
      thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li><li><strong>Base
      Speed</strong>: Gillmen have a base speed of 30 feet on land. As
      <em>aquatic</em> creatures, they also have a swim speed of 30 feet, can
      move in water without making <em>Swim</em> checks, and always treat
      <em>Swim</em> as a class skill.</li><li><strong>Languages</strong>:
      Gillmen begin play speaking Common and Aboleth. Gillmen with high
      <em>Intelligence</em> scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Aquan,
      Draconic, and Elven.</li></ul><h3>Defense Racial
      Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Enchantment Resistance</strong>: Gillmen gain a
      +2 racial bonus to saving throws against non-aboleth <em>enchantment</em>
      spells and effects, but take a –2 penalty on such saving throws against
      <em>aboleth</em> sources.</li></ul><h3>Weakness Racial
      Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Water Dependent</strong>: A gillman's body
      requires constant submersion in fresh or salt water. Gillmen who spend
      more than one day without fully submerging themselves in water risk
      internal organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and death within 4d6
      hours.</li></ul><h3>Other Racial
      Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Amphibious</strong>: Gillmen can breathe both
      water and air.</li></ul>
