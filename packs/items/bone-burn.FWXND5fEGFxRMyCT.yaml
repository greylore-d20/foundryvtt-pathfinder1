  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This flask of volatile chemicals contains traces of graveyard dirt and
      a few drops of blood from a righteous creature. You can throw a bone burn
      flask as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Against
      non-undead creatures, a bone burn flask functions as a normal flask of
      acid. Against undead creatures, the bone burn flask deals double damage.
      On the round following a direct hit, a skeletal undead damaged by a bone
      burn flask takes 1d6 additional points of damage (Reflex DC 15 negates).
      Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy)
