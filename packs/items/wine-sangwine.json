After drinking a glass, the wine gives the drinker's blood a bitter flavor for 1 hour, causing any creature that deals damage using the <em>blood drain</em> extraordinary ability to become <em>sickened</em> for a number of rounds equal to the points of <em>Constitution damage</em> dealt (this effect is not subject to the poison immunity of <em>vampires</em> and other <em>undead</em>). Repeated uses of the <em>blood drain</em> ability on a creature that has imbibed at least one glass of sangwine extends the duration of the <em>sickened</em> condition.</p>\r\n<p>The price listed is for a <em>bottle</em>, which contains six glasses' worth of sangwine.</p>\r\n"
