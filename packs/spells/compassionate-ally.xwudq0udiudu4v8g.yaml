      <p>At the sight of an injured ally, the target immediately disengages from
      its current course of action and rushes to provide aid. If the target
      possesses curative spells or magic items, it utilizes them to help the
      injured ally. If not, the target provides aid by performing a Heal check.
      The target remains with the injured ally to assure her safety and refuses
      to leave the ally's side until her wounds are fully treated or the spell
      ends, but can otherwise defend itself and make attacks.</p>
