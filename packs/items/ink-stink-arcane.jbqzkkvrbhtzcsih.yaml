      <p>Most common among ratfolk <em>alchemists</em>, arcane stink ink is used
      to inscribe formulae or spells into formula books and spellbooks. Like
      normal stink ink, the arcane version can only be read by creatures with
      the <em>scent</em> ability (although <em>read magic</em> works normally on
      spells and arcane formulae inscribed with stink ink). Using arcane stink
      ink to inscribe a spell or formula into a book costs +10% of the normal
      amount.</p>
