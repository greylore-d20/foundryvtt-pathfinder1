  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword,
      greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically
      confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by
      1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while
      wielding a weapon of this type.</p>
