      <p>A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in a lake, river, or similar
      body of water, making it possible for you to return to that location at a
      later date.</p>

      <p>A common buoy includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or
      sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and a 15-pound stone used as an
      anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small
      flag to attract attention. Though anchor buoys prove quite resilient to
      normal weather and tides, they offer little challenge to intelligent
      creatures determined to sabotage them.</p>

      <p>A superior buoy has a spherical or ovoid hollow metal float (typically
      copper), a length of <em>chain</em> rather than twine, and a metal anchor
      rather than a weight.</p>
