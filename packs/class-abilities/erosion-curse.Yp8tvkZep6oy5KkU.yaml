  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman summons the powers of nature to erode a construct or object
      within 30 feet. This erosion deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 shaman
      levels, ignoring hardness and damage reduction. If used against a
      construct or an object in another creatureâ€™s possession, the construct or
      the creature possessing the object can attempt a Reflex saving throw to
      halve the damage.</p>

      <p>Once an object or a construct is damaged by this erosion, it cannot be
      the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
