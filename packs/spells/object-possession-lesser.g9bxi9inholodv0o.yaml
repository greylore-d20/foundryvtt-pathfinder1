      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.4mw83czf7b62rar3]{possession}, except you
      possess an object instead of a creature. A possessed object becomes
      capable of animation, gaining the statistics of an animated object of its
      size (including 1 CP worth of abilities; <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>
      14). You can't use any spells or other abilities while possessing an
      object. A spiritual tether connects your body to the possessed object, in
      a manner similar to a silver cord (see page 244). If the possessed object
      and your body are ever farther than close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
      from one another, this tether breaks, returning your consciousness to your
      body.</p>
