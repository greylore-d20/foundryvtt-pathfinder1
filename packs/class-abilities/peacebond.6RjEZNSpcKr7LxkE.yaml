    value: >-
      <p>A witch can use this hex on a creature to prevent it from drawing a
      weapon for a number of rounds equal to the witch’s level. This hex has no
      effect on natural weapons or weapons already in a creature’s hands, but
      does prevent an archer from drawing arrows.</p>

      <p>A Will save negates this effect, and whether or not the save is
      successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1
      day.</p>
