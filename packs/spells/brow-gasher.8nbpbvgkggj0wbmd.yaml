    value: >-
      <p>You imbue a slashing melee weapon with the ability to deal a gruesome
      head wound. When the target weapon hits a living creature, in addition to
      the normal effects of that hit, the wielder can discharge this spell as a
      free action to open a gash on the target's forehead that deals bleed
      damage equal to half your caster level. At the start of each of the
      target's turns, when it takes bleed damage, it also takes a cumulative -1
      penalty on all attack rolls. When that penalty reaches -3, the target also
      treats all targets as having concealment (20% miss chance). When the
      penalty reaches -5, the target is blinded. Stopping the bleed damage ends
      the effects this spell imposes on the bleeding creature. A target that is
      immune to bleed damage is also immune to all this spell's effects.</p>
