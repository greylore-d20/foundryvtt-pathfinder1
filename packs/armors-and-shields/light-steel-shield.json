      "value": "<p>You strap a light steel shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A light steel shield’s weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it. Whether wooden or steel, a light shield offers the same basic protection and attack benefits, though the two varieties respond differently to some spells and effects (such as&nbsp;rusting grasp). A druid can use a light wooden shield, but not a light steel shield.<br><br>Shield Bash Attacks: You can bash an opponent with a light shield. See “light shield” on Table 1–5: Martial Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash with a light shield. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>"
