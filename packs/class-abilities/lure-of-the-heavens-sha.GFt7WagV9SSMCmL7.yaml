  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman’s connection to the skies above is so strong that her feet
      barely touch the ground. At 1st level, she no longer leaves tracks. At 5th
      level, she can hover up to 6 inches above the ground or liquid surfaces.
      At 10th level, the shaman gains the ability to
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.7d6sv5ecvi7kho3m]{fly} (as the spell) for a
      number of minutes per day equal to her shaman level—the duration does not
      need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
