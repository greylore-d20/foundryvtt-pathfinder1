The rounds do not need to be used consecutively. If you are in mid fall when this abilityâ€™s duration expires, you take falling damage as if you fell from the altitude you were at when the spell ended.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you can also apply your daily rounds of this ability to use @Compendium[pf1.spells.e4v1uv8hexeu9sxj]{Air Walk}.</p>"
