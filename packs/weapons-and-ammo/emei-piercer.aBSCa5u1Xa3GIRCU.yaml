  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon is used to augment unarmed martial techniques. It consists
      of an 8- to 10-inch-long, dual-pointed steel spike set on swivels and
      mounted on a ring, so that it can be spun around at high speeds when
      slipped over the wielder's ring finger. The ring prevents the wielder from
      being disarmed and turns unarmed strikes into piercing attacks.</p>
