  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a wall of faintly shimmering elemental energy. Upon casting
      the spell, choose either acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The spell gains
      the chosen descriptor, and any thrown weapons or ammunition that pass
      through the <i>augmenting wall</i> as part of a ranged attack deal 1d6
      points of energy damage of the specified type in addition to their normal
      damage. The wall has no effect on melee weapons or items not thrown as
      part of an attack.  As you cast the spell, you can limit the wall so that
      it only affects ranged weapons passing through it in the direction of your
      choice. Doing so halves the spell's duration.</p>
