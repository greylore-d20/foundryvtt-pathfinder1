    <p>You fuse your thoughts with an ally's, allowing the two of you to fight
    in tandem, perfectly coordinated. You and the ally each roll initiative in
    combat and use the higher die result before adding modifiers. This has three
    effects.</p><p>Melee: If you both make melee attacks against the same
    creature, you both make attack rolls and both use the higher of the two dice
    for your attack rolls (plus bonuses).</p><p>Ranged: If you both make ranged
    attacks against the same creature, you both make attack rolls and both use
    the higher of the two dice for your attack roll (plus bonuses).</p><p>Spell:
    If you both cast spells and target the same area or same creature, affected
    creatures take a -2 penalty on their saving throw against the
    spells.</p><p>You and the target lose these benefits if you cannot see each
    other or if you or the target is unconscious or helpless.</p>
