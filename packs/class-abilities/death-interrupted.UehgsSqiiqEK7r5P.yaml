  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A witch with this grand hex can pluck a dead creature’s soul from the
      River of Souls and store it in her familiar for safekeeping and eventual
      resurrection.</p><p>In order to use this ability, the witch must be
      adjacent to the target dead creature and her own familiar, and the ally’s
      soul must be free and willing to return at the witch’s behest. When the
      witch touches the creature’s remains (some small portion of the creature’s
      body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time),
      its soul enters the body of the witch’s familiar as per familiar melding,
      as if the witch’s familiar were the target’s familiar. The creature’s soul
      can remain within the witch’s familiar for up to 1 hour per class level
      the witch has.</p><p>During this time, the witch can telepathically
      communicate with the creature’s soul (though the soul cannot do anything
      else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard
      action that returns the creature’s soul to its body, brings it back to
      life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the
      witch’s caster level. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature’s
      body to return it to life. If a creature’s soul is in the witch’s familiar
      and this effect expires, or if the witch attempts to return the creature
      to life but is out of range, the creature remains dead.</p><p>Once a
      creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for
      24 hours.</p>
