      "value": "<p>When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses incorporeal form, she becomes shrouded in a haze of insubstantial mist, granting her concealment against ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the spiritualist can better affect incorporeal creatures with melee attacks; her unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks are treated as if they had the&nbsp;ghost touch&nbsp;magic weapon special ability.</p>\n<p>At 13th level, the spiritualist can take a standard action to become invisible (as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility}&nbsp;spell) the start of her next turn.</p>\n<p>At 18th level, the spiritualist gains the incorporeal subtype and a fly speed of 30 feet (good) while using this form of bonded manifestation.</p>"
