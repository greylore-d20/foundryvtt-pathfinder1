    value: >-
      <i>You are adept at guiding your mount through
      combat.</i><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Ride 1
      rank.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Once per round when your mount is
      hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as an immediate action) to
      negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater
      than the opponent's attack roll.</p>
