      <p>You change outfits or create a disguise out of materials you are
      wearing or carrying (potentially including a disguise kit). The spell
      can't alter your body or change the structure of objects, but can style
      wigs, apply makeup or piercings, and otherwise make use of tools to make
      superficial changes. In an instant, you have a nonmagical disguise or
      clothing change. Attempt a Disguise check to determine the effectiveness
      of the disguise.</p>
