  shortDescription: >-
    <p>By touching a single door, gate, or other portal, you create a keyhole
    where none existed before or double the size of an existing keyhole. A
    conjured keyhole allows you to peer through the door, though the limited
    perspective imposes a -10 penalty on Perception checks to spot anything
    beyond. It also allows a sealed door to be locked or picked if it could not
    be before. Locking or unlocking such a door requires a successful Disable
    Device check with a DC equal to the barrier's break DC + 10. Enlarging an
    existing keyhole allows viewers to peer through to whatever lies beyond,
    even if the preexisting keyhole did not allow it, and it reduces the Disable
    Device DC to open or lock the door by 5.  This spell does not normally allow
    a saving throw, but magic doors and barriers can resist the effect with a
    successful Will saving throw, as if they were carried by their original
    creator.</p>
