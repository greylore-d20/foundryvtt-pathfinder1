  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all
    sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has
    concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have
    total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to
    locate the target).</p><p>A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a <i>gust
    of wind</i> spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph)
    disperses the fog in 1 round. A <i>fireball, flame strike</i>, or similar
    spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A <i>Wall
    of Fire</i> burns away the fog in the area into which it deals
    damage.</p><p>This spell does not function underwater.</p>
