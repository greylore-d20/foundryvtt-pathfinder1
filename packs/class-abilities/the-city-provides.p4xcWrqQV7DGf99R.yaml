  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day as a full-round action when in an urban environment, you
      can scrounge up any nonmagical item of your choosing with a value of up to
      10 gp per oracle level. You cannot obtain coins or trade goods, and the
      item is too tattered to resell (though fully functional). If you scrounge
      a new item, any item previously obtained in this way becomes useless.</p>
