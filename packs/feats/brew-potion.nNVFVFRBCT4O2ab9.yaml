      <i>You can create magic potions.</i><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      Caster level 3rd.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You can create a potion
      of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more
      creatures or objects. Brewing a potion takes 2 hours if its base price is
      250 gp or less, otherwise brewing a potion takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp
      in its base price. When you create a potion, you set the caster level,
      which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than
      your own level. To brew a potion, you must use up raw materials costing
      one half this base price. See the magic item creation rules in Magic Items
      for more information.</p><p>When you create a potion, you make any choices
      that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the
      potion is the target of the spell.</p>
