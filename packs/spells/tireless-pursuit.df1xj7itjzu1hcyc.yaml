    value: >-
      <p>You harden your body against the stresses of long travel. You halve the
      damage caused by hustling and forced marching (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook</i> 171). In addition, for the duration of the spell you ignore
      any fatigue caused by such travel. Once the spell ends, if you still have
      any nonlethal damage caused by the hustling or forced march, you become
      fatigued, or exhausted if already fatigued.</p>
