      <p>The area of this spell is covered in chilling frost, dealing 2d6 points
      of cold damage to all creatures within it. Creatures that the spell
      initially damages must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for
      1 round. The area remains chilled for the spell's duration. Any creature
      that starts your turn within the spell's area takes 1d6 points of cold
      damage (Fortitude saving throw for half) but does not become staggered
      even on a failed saving throw.</p>
