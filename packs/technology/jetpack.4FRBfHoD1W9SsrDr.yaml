      charge/round</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A jetpack consists of a pair of
      cylindrical tanks worn on a shoulder harness with a pair of
      motion-sensitive rings worn on the thumbs that are used as wireless thrust
      and attitude controls. The jetpack can be activated as a swift action and
      grants a fly speed of 60 feet with poor maneuverability. If the wearer
      successfully hovers near ground level, she obscures visibility as though
      she had the Hover feat (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em> 315). The exhaust
      isn't hot or concentrated enough to be used as a weapon.</p><p>A jetpack
      can be operated in overdrive, giving the wearer a fly speed of 90 feet
      with clumsy maneuverability and consuming twice as many charges per
      round.</p><p>While it is normally possible to wear an item in the
      shoulders slot as well as an item on the back, a jetpack's bulk precludes
      the wearer also using a backpack, <em>handy haversack</em>, or other items
      worn on the back.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 26;
