    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent gains better access to magic items from
      black market connections. She treats every settlement as one size greater
      for the purpose of determining the gp limit of the base value of items for
      sale, as well as the number of minor, medium, and major magic items for
      sale in the settlement. If the settlement is already a metropolis, all
      minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic
      items. With a successful Diplomacy check, the character can treat the
      settlement as two sizes larger. If the settlement is already a metropolis
      and she succeeds at the check, all magic items are for sale. If the
      settlement is already a large city and she succeeds at the check, all
      minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic
      items. With a successful check, the character can also sell stolen items
      on the black market. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character does
      something to spook the market, and treats the city as normal for 1 week.
      Furthermore, those in control of the black market may alert the
      authorities to the characterâ€™s presence in an act of reprisal for spooking
      the market or to divert attention away from their illicit activities. The
      DCs of the checks are by settlement size and are given in the table
      below.<br /><br /></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Community
