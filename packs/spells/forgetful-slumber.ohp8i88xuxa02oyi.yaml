      <p>This spell acts as the <i>deeper slumber</i> spell, but only affects
      one creature of 10 Hit Dice or fewer. In addition, a creature affected by
      this spell awakens with no knowledge of the events that led to the spell's
      casting. The target loses all memory from the 5 minutes prior to falling
      asleep. No effect short of a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> can restore
      memories lost by this spell.</p>
