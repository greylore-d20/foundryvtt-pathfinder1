  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An estoc is a sword about as long as a bastard sword, but designed
      exclusively for thrusting attacks. Its "blade" is a steel spike with a
      triangular, square, or hexagonal crosssection. Like the bastard sword, an
      estoc requires special training to use it one handed, but it can also be
      wielded as a two-handed martial weapon. When you wield an estoc with one
      hand, treat it as a one-handed weapon; when you wield an estoc with two
      hands, treat it as a two-handed weapon. If you can use the estoc
      proficiently with one hand, you can also use the Weapon Finesse feat to
      apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack
      rolls when wielding an estoc sized for you with one or two hands, even
      though it isn't a light weapon.</p>
