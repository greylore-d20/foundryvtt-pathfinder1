      <p><strong>Category</strong> Torture Implements</p><p>This device is a
      sharp, double-ended prong that is approximately 9 inches in length and
      fitted with a stout leather neckband.</p><p>This nefarious device is
      secured on a helpless target’s neck so the prongs pierce both the
      underside of the victim’s chin and the victim’s chest, dealing 1d6 points
      of nonlethal damage when the device is attached and an additional 1d6
      points of nonlethal damage if the victim begins to fall asleep,
      effectively keeping the victim awake indefinitely and subjecting the
      victim to fatigue and exhaustion through sleep deprivation.</p><p>A
      successful DC 22 Escape Artist check allows the victim to get free of the
      prongs without using his arms, though the heretic’s fork remains strapped
      to his neck.</p>
