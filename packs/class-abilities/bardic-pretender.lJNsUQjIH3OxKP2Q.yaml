  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The character knows enough about music and performance to survive in a
      bardic college and can fake what she doesn’t know. The character qualifies
      as having the <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bard">inspire
      competence bardic performance class feature</a> for the purpose of meeting
      prestige class requirements, although this talent doesn’t grant her the
      bardic performance ability.</p>
