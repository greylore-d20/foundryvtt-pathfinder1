      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      none</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> -; <strong>Usage</strong>
      disposable</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A grenade is a small, cylindrical
      device that is designed to be thrown as a splash weapon or fired from a
      grenade launcher (see page 24). Before being thrown by hand, the grenade
      must be primed with a quick twist of a dial at one end and then armed with
      a click of a button at the center of that dial. Priming and arming a
      grenade is a free action; a grenade launcher primes and arms all grenades
      it fires. The grenade detonates at the beginning of the wielder's next
      turn, hopefully in the area targeted. When a grenade detonates, it damages
      all targets within a 20-footradius spread. A successful DC 15 Reflex save
      halves any damage dealt by a grenade.</p><p>The type of damage dealt by
      grenades varies widely and depends upon the nature of the specific
      grenade. The different types of grenades and the damage types they deal
      (along with any additional effects their damage deals) are listed
