  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Used tactically for long-range attacks on troops, these arrows are
      fitted with heavy iron heads. While these heads help them travel great
      distances, they make the arrows less effective at dealing damage.</p>

      <p>Iron-tipped distance arrows increase their bow's range increment by 10
      feet but take a <b>-1 penalty on damage</b> dealt per range increment
      (minimum 1 point of damage).</p>

      <p>They are sold in leather quivers in quantities of 20.</p>
