  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, an investigator can choose to make a studied strike
      against the target of his studied combat as a free action, upon
      successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, to deal
      additional damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6
      for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The
      damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a
      critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune
      to studied strike.<p>If the investigator’s attack used a weapon that deals
      nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose
      to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage
      instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with
      a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual –4 penalty),
      the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.<p>The
      investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a
      vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot
      use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p>
