      <ul>

      <li>d10 Hit Die.</li>

      <li>Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (fast progression).</li>

      <li>No good saving throws.</li>

      <li>Skill points equal to 2 + Int modifier (minimum 1) per Hit Die.

      <li>Construct Size Bonus Hit Points Fine — Diminutive — Tiny — Small 10
      Medium 20 Large 30 Huge 40 Gargantuan 60 Colossal 80</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Traits</h2>

      <p>A construct possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
      creature’s entry).</p>

      <ul>

      <li>No Constitution score. Any DCs or other statistics that rely on a
      Constitution score treat a construct as having a score of 10 (no bonus or
      penalty).</li>

      <li>Low-light vision.</li>

      <li>Darkvision 60 feet.</li>

      <li>Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale
      effects, patterns, and phantasms).</li>

      <li>Immunity to disease, death effects, necromancy effects, paralysis,
      poison, sleep effects, and stunning.</li>

      <li>Cannot heal damage on its own, but often can be repaired via exposure
      to a certain kind of effect (see the creature’s description for details)
      or through the use of the <em>Craft Construct</em> feat. Constructs can
      also be healed through spells such as <em>make whole</em>. A construct
      with the fast healing special quality still benefits from that
      quality.</li>

      <li>Not subject to <em>ability damage</em>, <em>ability drain</em>,
      fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, or nonlethal damage.</li>

      <li>Immunity to any effect that requires a <em>Fortitude</em> save (unless
      the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).</li>

      <li>Not at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed when
      reduced to 0 hit points or less.</li>

      <li>A construct cannot be raised or resurrected.</li>

      <li>A construct is hard to destroy, and gains bonus hit points based on
      size, as shown on the following table.</li>

      </ul>

      <ul>

      <li>Proficient with its natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in
      form, in which case proficient with any weapon mentioned in its
      entry.</li>

      <li>Proficient with no armor.</li>

      <li>Constructs do not breathe, eat, or sleep.</li>

      </ul>
