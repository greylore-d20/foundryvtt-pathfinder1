Gloom sight goggles interact with the unique eyes of <em>fetchlings</em> in such a way that when the goggles are worn over both eyes, they expand the range of a <em>fetchling's</em> <em>darkvision</em> to 90 feet, but the <em>fetchling</em> also gains the <em>light sensitivity</em> weakness. Other races cannot see through the lenses of these goggles, and they have no affect on <em>fetchlings</em> whose eyes have been modified by the Gloom Sight feat. Though they are alchemical rather than magical in nature, these goggles take up the magic item eye slot.</p>"
