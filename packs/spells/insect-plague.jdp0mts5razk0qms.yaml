  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You summon a number of swarms of wasps (one per three levels, to a
    maximum of six swarms at 18th level, see the <i>Pathfinder RPG
    Bestiary</i>). The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to
    at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous
    area). You may summon the wasp swarms so that they share the area of other
    creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms
    are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures that
    flee.</p>
