    <p>You emit a shrill, piercing shriek, startling those around you into
    dropping their guard. Enemies in the area must make a successful saving
    throw or immediately provoke attacks of opportunity from foes that threaten
    them. You and your allies are unaffected by your own <i>screech</i>.</p>
