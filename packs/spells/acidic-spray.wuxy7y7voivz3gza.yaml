      <p>A spray of acid erupts from your outstretched hand, dealing 1d6 points
      of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature within its
      area (Reflex half ). This acid continues to burn for 1 round, dealing 1d6
      points of acid damage per two caster levels (maximum 7d6) to any creature
      that failed its saving throw against the spell (a second Reflex save on
      the creature's turn negates this additional damage).</p>
