    value: >-
      <p>As a free action, you can open a link to communicate telepathically
      with a single ally within 60 feet. The telepathic link is two-way and
      lasts for 1 minute. Unlike normal telepathy, this ability requires a
      shared language. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
      to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Touch of Good power of the Good Domain.</p>
