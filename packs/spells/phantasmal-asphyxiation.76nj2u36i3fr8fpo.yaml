  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your target must succeed at a Will save or believe it can no longer
      breathe. An affected target must attempt a Fortitude save each round at
      the beginning of its turn. The first time it fails the Fortitude save, it
      is staggered until the next time it attempts a save against the spell. If
      the target fails a second Fortitude save in a row, it falls unconscious
      for the spell's remaining duration. The target breathes normally while
      unconscious, but is shaken for 1 minute upon awakening. If the target
      succeeds at two Fortitude saves in a row, it shakes off the spell's
      effects entirely. Otherwise, the target continues to attempt a save each
      round until it falls unconscious or the spell ends. This spell has no
      effect on creatures that don't need to breathe.</p>
