  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This fuzzy fruit, bred eons ago by remote lashunta clans, possesses
      strange energetic properties. An unprocessed fruit is enough to sustain a
      person’s need for food for 24 hours, but pharmaceutical processes can
      enhance a fengar’s effects. Consuming an enhanced fengar immediately
      removes fatigue and exhaustion conditions, and grants a +2 alchemical
      bonus on saving throws against electricity for 24
      hours.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 22;
