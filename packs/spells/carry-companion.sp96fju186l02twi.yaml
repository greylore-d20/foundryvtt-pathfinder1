  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You touch an animal or magical beast that has a helpful attitude toward
      you, instantly transforming the creature into a miniature figurine of
      stone, small enough to fit into the palm of your hand. Creatures with an
      attitude of less than helpful will not tolerate this spell, and it
      automatically fails to work on them. An intelligent animal or magical
      beast must be a willing subject in order for this spell to take effect.
      Any items that the creature wears (such as a harness or saddle) or carries
      (such as those stowed in saddlebags) are transformed along with the
      creature.  While miniaturized, the creature is under an effect similar to
      that of a <i>flesh to stone</i> spell: It is mindless and inert, and does
      not seem alive when viewed with spells like <i>deathwatch</i>. However,
      you may return the creature to its normal form at any time simply by
      placing the figurine on the ground, touching it, and uttering a word of
      command. Otherwise, the creature remains in miniature form unless the
      spell is broken, such as by <i>dispel magic</i> or stronger magic. Unlike
      a <i>flesh to stone</i> spell, a creature affected by <i>carry
      companion</i> is unaffected by <i>stone to flesh</i>. If the miniature
      figurine is broken or damaged, the creature (if returned to its original
      state) has similar damage or deformities.</p>
