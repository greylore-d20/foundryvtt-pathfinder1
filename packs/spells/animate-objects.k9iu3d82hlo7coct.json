Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate.</p><p>An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or a corresponding number of larger objects as follows: A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. See the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> for the statistics of animated objects.</p><p>This spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.</p><p><i>Animate objects</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>"
