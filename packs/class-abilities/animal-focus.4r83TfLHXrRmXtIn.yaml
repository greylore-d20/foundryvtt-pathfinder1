    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift
      action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or
      special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level.
      The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to
      her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be
      spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a
      time.<p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal
      companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the
      animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this
      way does not count against the hunter’s minutes of duration per day-it
      remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion’s aspect can
      be the same aspect the ranger has taken on or a different one. The hunter
      can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal
      companion as part of the same swift action.<p>If the hunter’s animal
      companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion’s animal focus to
      herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal
      one she can choose, and (as with a companion’s focus) remains in effect
      until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per
      day.</p>
