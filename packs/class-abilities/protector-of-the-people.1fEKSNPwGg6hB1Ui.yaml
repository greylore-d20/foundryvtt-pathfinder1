  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the cavalier can inspire the people around him as a swift
      action. Each creature within 30 feet that is either a resident of his
      chosen settlement or whose alignment is within one step of the cavalier’s
      settlement gains a morale bonus on saving throws equal to the cavalier’s
      Charisma modifier for 1 round. This bonus doubles if a creature meets both
      requirements. The cavalier can use this ability once per day, plus one
      additional time per day at 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
