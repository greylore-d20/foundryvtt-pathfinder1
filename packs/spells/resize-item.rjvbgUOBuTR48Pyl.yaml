      <p>You alter a magic weapon or suit of armor to be up to two size
      categories larger or smaller. If the spell on a resized suit of armor ends
      while the armor is being worn, the armor falls off harmlessly. If the
      spell would cause an item to grow too large for the area containing it,
      its growth halts just before that point.</p><p><em>Resize item</em> can be
      made permanent with a @Compendium[pf1.spells.nsxngq65mbrzgwnm]{permanency}
      spell for 7,500 gp, in which case the affected object is set at one
      specific new size within two steps of its original size.</p>
