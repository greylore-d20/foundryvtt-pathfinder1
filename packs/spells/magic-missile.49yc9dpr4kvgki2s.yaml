    value: >-
      <p>A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes
      its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.</p><p>The missile
      strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it
      has less than total cover or total concealment.</p><p>Specific parts of a
      creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the
      spell.</p><p>For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an
      additional missile-two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the
      maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple
      missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several
      creatures.</p><p>A single missile can strike only one creature. You must
      designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll
      damage.</p>
