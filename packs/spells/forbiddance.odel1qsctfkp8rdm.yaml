  shortDescription: >-
    <p><i>Forbiddance</i> seals an area against all planar travel into or within
    it. This includes all teleportation spells (such as <i>dimension door</i>
    and <i>teleport),</i> plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and
    all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically.</p><p>In
    addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are different from
    yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on
    their alignment relative to yours (see below). A creature inside the area
    when the spell is cast takes no damage unless it exits the area and attempts
    to reenter, at which time it is affected as normal.</p><p><i>Alignments
    identical</i>: No effect. The creature may enter the area freely (although
    not by planar travel).</p><p><i>Alignments different with respect to either
    law/chaos or good/evil</i>: The creature takes 6d6 points of damage. A
    successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resistance
    applies.</p><p><i>Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and
    good/evil</i>: The creature takes 12d6 points of damage. A successful Will
    save halves the damage, and spell resistance applies.</p><p>At your option,
    the abjuration can include a password, in which case creatures of alignments
    different from yours can avoid the damage by speaking the password as they
    enter the area. You must select this option (and the password) at the time
    of casting. Adding a password requires the burning of additional rare
    incenses worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per 60-foot
    cube.</p><p><i>Dispel magic</i> does not dispel a <i>forbiddance</i> effect
    unless the dispeller's level is at least as high as your caster
    level.</p><p>You can't have multiple overlapping <i>forbiddance</i> effects.
    In such a case, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older
    effect.</p>
