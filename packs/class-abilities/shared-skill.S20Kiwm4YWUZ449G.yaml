      <p>At 13th level, each time you set up an emotional bond, you can choose
      one Intelligence- or Charisma-based skill from the list of psychicâ€™s class
      skills. Any subject of your bond can use your bonus instead of his own
      when attempting checks with that skill as long as the bond lasts.</p>
