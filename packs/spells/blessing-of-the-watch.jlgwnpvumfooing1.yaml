  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>bless</i>, except as noted. It works only in
    the caster's home city, and in areas under the jurisdiction of the city
    watch. For example, if the watch patrols a shantytown outside the city walls
    but not the ruined subterranean tunnels that lie beneath the city, the spell
    works in the former area but not the latter.</p>
