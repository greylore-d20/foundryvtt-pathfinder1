  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon an insubstantial spirit of force that resembles a cloudy
      vapor hovering around your fists or any melee weapons you wield. The
      spirit compensates for your defensive or reckless melee attacks, nudging
      your weapons in the proper direction. When you voluntarily use one or more
      actions or feats that apply penalties to attack rolls with your melee
      weapons (such as a charge, fighting defensively, or using the Power Attack
      feat), the spirit reduces the total penalty on affected attacks by 1 (to a
      minimum penalty of 0). The penalty is reduced by an additional 1 for every
      5 caster levels you possess (to a minimum penalty of 0). Only penalties
      incurred by voluntary use of feats or maneuvers are reduced by this
      spell.  The spirit can't be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but
      <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, a <i>rod of cancellation</i>, or
      a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> can affect it. A protective spirit's AC
      against touch attacks is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
