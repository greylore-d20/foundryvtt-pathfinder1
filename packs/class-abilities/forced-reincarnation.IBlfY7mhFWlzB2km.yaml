    value: >-
      <p>The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to die and be immediately
      reincarnated into a new body. A Will save negates this effect. Those that
      fail are slain and immediately brought back to life with the spell
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.3w1ozzzf8hk0gdzm]{Reincarnate}.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target
      of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
