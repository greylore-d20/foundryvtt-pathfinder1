      <p>You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of
      its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following
      options.</p><p><i>Approach</i>: On its turn, the subject moves toward you
      as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do
      nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity
      for this movement as normal.</p><p><i>Drop</i>: On its turn, the subject
      drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its
      next turn.</p><p><i>Fall</i>: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground
      and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes
      any appropriate penalties.</p><p><i>Flee</i>: On its turn, the subject
      moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing
      but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this
      movement as normal.</p><p><i>Halt</i>: The subject stands in place for 1
      round. It may not take any actions but is not considered
      helpless.</p><p>If the subject can't carry out your command on its next
      turn, the spell automatically fails.</p>
