    value: >-
      <p><b>Element</b> universal; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 6;
      <b>Burn</b> 0</p>

      <p>You can use this wild talent as part of activating a kinetic blast
      other than telekinetic blast. You transform yourself into your element or
      energy and send yourself along with your kinetic blast. You appear at the
      end of the blast’s path, adjacent to the blast’s target (or final target,
      for form infusions like chain) or at the center of the burst or spread for
      form infusions like explosion.</p>

      <p>This ability doesn’t work with form infusions that involve melee
      attacks (such as kinetic blade) or that use a cone shape (such as
      spray).</p>
