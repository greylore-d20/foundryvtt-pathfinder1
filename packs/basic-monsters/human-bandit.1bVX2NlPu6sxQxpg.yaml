          <p>An improved form of leather armor, studded leather armor is covered
          with dozens of metal protuberances. While these rounded studs offer
          little defense individually, in the numbers they are arrayed in upon
          such armor, they help catch lethal edges and channel them away from
          vital spots. The rigidity caused by the additional metal does,
          however, result in less mobility than is afforded by a suit of normal
          leather armor.</p>

          <p>This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can
          use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also
          use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an
          off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed
          weapon), but you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so.
          This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your
          off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a
          weapon in your off hand, you lose the buckler’s AC bonus until your
          next turn. You can cast a spell with somatic components using your
          shield arm, but you lose the buckler’s AC bonus until your next turn.
          You can’t make a shield bash with a buckler.</p>

          <p>You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size.
          You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are
          made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a
          minimum Strength modifier to use it with proficiency). If your
          Strength modifier is less than the strength rating of the composite
          bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks
          with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of
          +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made
          with a high strength rating to take advantage of an aboveaverage
          Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength modifier
          on damage rolls, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each
          point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. If
          you have a negative modifier due to low Strength, apply it to damage
          rolls when you use a composite longbow. A composite longbow fires
          arrows.</p><p>For the purposes of Weapon Proficiency and similar
          feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.</p>

    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>Bandits are the scourge of the highway, robbing the rich and poor
        alike. Freebooting scoundrels simply out for a good time, bandits care
        only about themselves and their band of rogues. They accost and shake
        down innocent travelers, hijack poorly-guarded merchant caravans, charge
        tolls at remote bridges, or simply plunder isolated farmsteads and
        villages.</p><p>Bandits can be deserters from an army, disaffected
        huntsmen, rootless drifters with no taste for hard work, cattle rustlers
        or horse thieves, or even folk-hero freedom fighters who rob from the
        rich to feed the poor.</p><p>Bandits can be used as low-level archer
        soldiers (N alignment, replace Dodge feat with Weapon Focus [longbow])
        or crossbowmen (replace longbow with light or heavy crossbow), or as
        guards manning city walls (LN alignment, replace rapiers with longswords
        and replace Dodge feat with Weapon Focus [longsword]). They can also be
        used as bored young nobles or dandies out on a hunt or as low-level
        scouts or outriders.</p><p>Bandits are usually found in pairs (CR 1) or
        in a gang of a dozen accompanying a highwayman (CR 8). They often make
        up the rank-and-file members of a bandit lord’s gang (CR 12).</p>
