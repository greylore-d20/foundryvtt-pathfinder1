      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cloak an area in illusion, allowing you to change the area’s appearance. You can affect up to one 5-footcube area for every occultist level you posses, changing the appearance in a way that seems natural to the surroundings, subject to GM discretion. You could, for example, hide a door or passageway, make a table appear to be covered in food, or even create the illusion of a pit. You can’t make creatures or objects invisible with this power, but you can change the appearance of an object or create an illusion for creatures to hide behind.</p>\n<p>This functions as&nbsp;major image, and creatures that physically interact with the illusion in any way can attempt a Will save to see through the mirage.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>"
