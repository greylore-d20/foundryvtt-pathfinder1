    value: >-
      <p>You magically scour the world's libraries for information that might
      refresh your memory about a topic. Upon casting this spell, the focus
      book's pages fill with snippets and selections from countless books. You
      can spend up to 1 round per caster level (maximum 10) reading these notes.
      You may cease reading at any time, and when you do you can immediately
      attempt one Knowledge check with a +1 circumstance bonus for each round
      you spent studying the book (maximum +10). The writing disappears when the
      spell ends, and if you fail to succeed at a Knowledge check on the round
      you stop reading the notes, you don't gain the benefits of this spell.</p>
