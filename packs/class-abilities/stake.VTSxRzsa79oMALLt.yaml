    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, any piercing weapon or sharp tool (such as a piton) a
      vampire hunter drives through a vampireâ€™s heart is treated as a <em>wooden
      stake</em> for purposes of creatures who are vulnerable to them. If this
      improvised stake is removed, the vampire returns to life as normal.</p>
