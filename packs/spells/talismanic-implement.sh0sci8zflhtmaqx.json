    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions as <i>contingency</i>, but you invest a spell whose level doesn't exceed one-quarter of your level (rounded down, maximum spell level 3rd) into one of your implements that holds 2 or more points of mental focus. The spell's school must match that of the implement, and the spell must be one that affects only your person. Casting <i>talismanic implement</i> reduces the selected implement's mental focus by 2, including for the purposes of determining the effects of resonant powers. When you refresh your mental focus, <i>talismanic implement</i> ends automatically, even if the duration hasn't elapsed. Unlike <i>contingency</i>, you may have multiple <i>talismanic implement</i>s simultaneously, though a single implement can hold only one <i>talismanic implement</i> spell, and if you have any <i>talismanic implement</i>s, you can't have any other kind of <i>contingency</i> in effect.</p>"
