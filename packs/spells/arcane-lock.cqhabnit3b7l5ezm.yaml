  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An <i>arcane lock</i> spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal
      magically locks it. You can freely pass your own arcane lock without
      affecting it. If the locked object has a lock, the DC to open that lock
      increases by 10 while it remains attached to the object. If the object
      does not have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with
      a DC 20 Disable Device skill check. A door or object secured with this
      spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful <i>dispel
      magic</i> or <i>knock</i> spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a
      door or portal affected by this spell. A <i>knock</i> spell does not
      remove an <i>arcane lock</i>; it only suppresses the effect for 10
      minutes.</p>
