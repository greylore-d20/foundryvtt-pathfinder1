      <p>Animal musk, spoiled meat, pungent plants, and any other foul-smelling
      substances on hand go into a batch of brewed reek. When boiled, this
      mixture becomes a thick alchemical slime that adheres to anything it
      touches. You can hurl brewed reek as a <em>splash weapon</em> with a range
      increment of 10 feet. A creature struck with a direct hit must succeed at
      a DC 15 <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>sickened</em> for 2d6 rounds. If
      the target fails its save, it must make a second <em>Fortitude</em> save
      or be <em>nauseated</em> for 1 round. Creatures in the splash area must
      make a <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>sickened</em> for 1 round. A
      creature that drinks brewed reek does not get a saving throw and is
      <em>sickened</em> for 2d6 rounds and <em>nauseated</em> for 1
      round.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (alchemy)</strong> DC
