      "value": "<p>At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, he makes a&nbsp;<em>Perform</em>&nbsp;(act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by an&nbsp;<em>illusion</em>&nbsp;(<em>pattern</em>) or&nbsp;<em>illusion</em>&nbsp;(<em>figment</em>) magical attack may use the bard’s&nbsp;<em>Perform</em>&nbsp;check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the&nbsp;<em>Perform</em>&nbsp;check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the Distraction is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous&nbsp;<em>illusion</em>&nbsp;(<em>pattern</em>) or&nbsp;<em>illusion</em>&nbsp;(<em>figment</em>) magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it sees the Distraction, but it must use the bard’s&nbsp;<em>Perform</em>&nbsp;check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.</p>"
