    "shortDescription": "<p>You augment an ongoing illusion effect to strike out painfully at creatures that see through it. When a creature successfully disbelieves an illusion that is the target of <i>painful revelation</i>, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces the nonlethal damage by half and negates the staggered effect. Once <i>painful revelation</i> has been triggered, the spell ends.  However, creatures under the effect of spells such as <i>true seeing</i> that automatically pierce illusions are not subject to this effect.</p>"
