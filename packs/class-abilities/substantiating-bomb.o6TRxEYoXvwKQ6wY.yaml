    value: >-
      <p>Your bombs are infused with ectoplasm and a longing for life, lending
      ethereal creatures a measure of substance. You can throw a bomb that
      inflicts no damage but instead creates a 10-foot-radius cloud of fog that
      functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud} and lasts
      for 1 round per alchemist level. Incorporeal creatures that pass through
      this cloud become partially solid, taking half damage from nonmagic
      attacks and full damage from magic weapons, spells, and spell-like
      abilities. This effect lasts for the duration of the smoke cloud, even if
      the incorporeal creature moves outside the cloudâ€™s area. A creature
      affected by the cloud can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the
      substantiating effects of this bomb.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be 10th level before selecting this discovery.</p>
