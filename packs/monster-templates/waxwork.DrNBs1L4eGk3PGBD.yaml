      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Inherited<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>The practice of making sculptures
      from wax dates back to the earliest humanoid civilizations. Only the
      medium of wax can so closely duplicate the transparency of skin. Often,
      creators use powerful magic to house an animating spirit within the wax
      model. A created waxwork creature obeys the commands of its creator.
      Rarely, a wax sculpture animates of it own accord—the result of nearby
      magic suffusing the wax or a lost spirit in search of a corporeal form.
      Such waxwork creatures are uncontrolled.<p>A waxwork creature is the same
      size as the creature it duplicates, but weighs only half as
      much.<p>“Waxwork” is an inherited template that can be added to any Tiny
      or larger corporeal creature (other than a construct or ooze), referred to
      hereafter as the base creature.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Depends on Hit
      Dice, as follows.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment:</b> Always neutral.<p><b>Type:</b> The creature’s type
      changes to construct. It doesn’t retain any subtypes, nor does it gain the
      augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special
      abilities except as noted here.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> The waxwork
      creature’s natural armor bonus is based on its size.<p><b>Hit Dice:</b>
      Remove HD gained from class levels and change racial HD to d10s. Creatures
      without racial HD are treated as if they have 1 racial HD. As constructs,
      waxwork creatures gain additional hit points as noted in the following
      table.<p><b>Saves:</b> The creature’s base save bonuses are Fortitude +1/3
      HD, Reflex +1/3 HD, and Will +1/3 HD.<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A
      waxwork creature loses the base creature’s defensive abilities. It gains
      waxen regeneration 5 (fire) and immunity to cold. If it has 11 or more HD,
      the waxen regeneration increases to 10 (fire). It also gains all of the
      standard immunities and traits possessed by constructs.<p><em>Waxen
      Regeneration (Su): </em>This ability functions like regeneration, except
      the waxwork creature has it without a Constitution score. A waxwork
      creature reduced to 0 hit points is staggered instead of destroyed while
      its waxen regeneration is active; it ignores all damage dealt to it that
      would reduce its hit points below 0. Fire damage causes the waxwork
      creature’s regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the
      attack.<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> A waxwork creature is vulnerable to
      fire.<p><b>Speed:</b> A waxwork creature retains movement types, except as
      follows: It loses burrow and magical flight speeds. Winged waxwork
      creatures can fly, but maneuverability drops to clumsy. A waxwork creature
      floats and must succeed at a DC 20 Swim check each round to stay
      underwater.<p><b>Attacks:</b> A waxwork creature retains all the natural
      weapons and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a
      slam attack that deals damage based on the waxwork creature’s size, but as
      if it were one size category larger than its actual size.<p><b>Special
      Attacks:</b> A waxwork creature retains none of the base creature’s
      special attacks.<p><b>Abilities:</b> A waxwork creature has no
      Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores
      change to 10.<p><b>BAB:</b> A waxwork creature’s base attack bonus is
      equal to its Hit Dice.<p><b>Skills:</b> A waxwork creature loses all of
      the base creature’s skills and gains none of its own.<p><b>Feats:</b> A
      waxwork creature loses all of the base creature’s feats and gains Improved
      Initiative as a bonus feat.<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> A waxwork creature
      loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any
      extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks.
      A waxwork creature gains the freeze universal monster ability to appear as
      a wax sculpture.</p>
