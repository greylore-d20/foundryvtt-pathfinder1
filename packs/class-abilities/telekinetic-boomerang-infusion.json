This allows you to pull it back to you after the attack and catch it if you have enough free hands (and assuming it is small enough for you to carry). This prevents the object from taking damage, but it also prevents you from loosening the strands of aether (see telekinetic blast).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if the attack missed, on your next turn as a standard action, you can you can snap the elastic strand back to make another attack with the same substance infusion and metakinesis, as if using a normal telekinetic blast (at which point the object takes damage and doesn’t return to you, and you can’t try again).</p>"
