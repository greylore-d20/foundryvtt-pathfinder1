    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC
      instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm’s first range
      increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment
      beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the –2 penalty on attack
      rolls for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this
      deed.</p>
