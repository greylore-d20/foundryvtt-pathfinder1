        <p><em>Clairaudience/clairvoyance</em> creates an invisible magical
        sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your
        choice) almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or
        line of effect, but the locale must be known--a place familiar to you,
        or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't
        move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as
        desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow
        magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the
        chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally
        pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the
        spell's effect. <em>Clairaudience/clairvoyance</em> functions only on
        the plane of existence you are currently occupying.</p>
