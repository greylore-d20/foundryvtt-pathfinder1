      "value": "\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>\r\n<p>This thin black liquid is stored in airtight flasks because it evaporates quickly when exposed to air. Its cloying vapors cling to a target, obscuring vision for a short period of time. You can throw a shadowcloy flask as a <em>splash weapon</em> with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit means the target treats the ambient light as one category darker than normal, with a creature already in natural darkness treating it as <em>supernatural</em> darkness. This effect lasts for 1 round. A thrown shadowcloy flask has no effect on adjacent creatures or if it misses.</p>\r\n"
