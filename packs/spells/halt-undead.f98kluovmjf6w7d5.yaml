      <p>This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A
      nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead
      creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature
      immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of <i>hold
      person on</i> a living creature). The effect is broken if the
      <i>halted</i> creatures are attacked or take damage.</p>
