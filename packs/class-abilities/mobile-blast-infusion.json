The mobile blast lasts until you dismiss it as a free action, lose consciousness, or move farther than 30 feet from it. Each round on your turn as a move action, you can move the mobile blast to another square within range; either way, it continues to deal damage to all creatures in its final square each round if they fail their saving throws.</p>\n<p>You can have only a single mobile blast in existence at a time. If the mobile blast’s total burn cost before applying any reduction for gather power is 0, it has no maximum duration. Otherwise, it lasts for a maximum number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier, and afterward you can’t create another mobile blast for a number of minutes equal to the number of rounds it existed. A mobile blast is always extremely loud and visible. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p>"
