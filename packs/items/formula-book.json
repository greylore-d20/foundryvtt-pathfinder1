A newly purchased formula book contains no extract formulas. An alchemist character begins play with a formula book containing the extract formulae he knows (Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide&nbsp;32). This is the alchemist equivalent of a spellbook for wizards (a spellbook and a formula book are essentially the same item).</p>"
