      <p>You strip all creatures within the emanation of any gifts associated
      with corruptions (see page 14). Abilities associated with corruptions
      cease to function, as if they were magically dispelled. The corruption
      stains still fully affect creatures. A creature that enters the emanation
      and fails its saving throw loses its gifts until the spell's duration
      ends, even if it leaves the emanation, but a successful saving throw
      renders a creature immune to the spell, even if it enters and exits the
      emanation several times.</p>
