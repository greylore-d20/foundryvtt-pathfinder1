  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Pirates often carry long brass knives for working aboard a ship. Though
      brass doesn't hold as sharp an edge as steel, it isn't vulnerable to rust
      like steel is. In a pinch, a pirate can use his brass knife as a weapon.
      Mostly, though, they are used for cutting ropes, cleaning fish, and other
      sundry tasks.</p><p>A brass knife has the fragile quality. A fragile
      weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an
      attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken,
      rolling a natural 1 destroys it instead.</p>
