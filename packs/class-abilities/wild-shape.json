      "value": "<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;type. This ability functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape I</a>&nbsp;spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>\n<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>\n<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elementals</a>, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or a Small&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, a druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body I</a>.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, a Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape III</a>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body II</a>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid’s wild shape functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape I</a>.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>&nbsp;or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body III</a>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape II</a>.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>&nbsp;or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body IV</a>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape III</a>.</p>"
