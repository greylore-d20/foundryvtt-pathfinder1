      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.8ai7fslz4zu8xe9s]{magic jar} except as
      noted above, and instead of your own soul, you can transfer a trapped soul
      (such as one trapped in a soul gem or trapped with <em>soul bind</em> or
      <em>trap the</em> soul) from the receptacle into an unwilling target's
      body. If the target creature fails its saving throw, it dies and the
      trapped soul in the receptacle permanently inhabits the body as if using
      <em>magic jar</em>. The trapped soul does not get a saving throw to resist
      this transfer. To dismiss the spell, you must be within range of the
      possessed body.</p>
