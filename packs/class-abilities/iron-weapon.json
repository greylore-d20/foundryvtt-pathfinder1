      "value": "<p>You can create a melee simple or martial weapon that lasts for 1 minute for every oracle level you possess. This weapon is appropriate for your size and entirely made of metal (even if it would normally include non-metal parts, such as a spear's shaft) but functions as if it were a normal weapon of its type. You are considered proficient with this weapon. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, the blade is made of cold iron.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the blade gains a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, the blade is made of adamantine.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>"
