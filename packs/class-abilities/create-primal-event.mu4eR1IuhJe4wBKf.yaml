    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can twist the magic of an area, forcing primal magic
      events to occur there. As a standard action, she can spend 2 points from
      her arcane reservoir to create a 10-foot-by-10-foot area of primal magic
      at a point within 30 feet. The arcanist can increase the size of the area
      to 20-foot-by-20-foot by spending 2 additional points from her arcane
      reservoir.</p>

      <p>The primal magic effect remains for 1 minute.</p>
