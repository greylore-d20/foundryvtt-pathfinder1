      <p><strong>Source</strong> Advanced Class Guide pg. 46</p><p>The shaman
      creates an invisible shell of air that grants her a +4 armor bonus to AC.
      At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2. At
      13th level, this barrier causes incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged
      attacks requiring an attack roll against her to suffer a 50% miss chance.
      The shaman can use this barrier for 1 hour per shaman level. This duration
      does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour
      increments.</p>
