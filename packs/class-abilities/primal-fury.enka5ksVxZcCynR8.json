You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your psychic level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You can end the effect as a free action.</p>\n<p>After using this ability, you are fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in primal fury.</p>\n<p>You cannot enter a new primal fury while fatigued or exhausted.
