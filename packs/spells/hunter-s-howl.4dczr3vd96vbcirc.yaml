      <p>With a single primal howl, you strike fear in your
      opponents.</p><p>Until the end of the spell's duration, you treat those
      affected by it as if they were your favored enemy, gaining a +2 bonus on
      weapon attack and damage rolls against them, and a +2 bonus on Bluff,
      Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against them. If
      an affected creature is already one of your favored enemies, it is shaken
      instead. This is a mindaffecting fear effect.</p>
