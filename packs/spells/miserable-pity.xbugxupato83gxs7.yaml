      <p>This spell functions as <i>sanctuary</i>, except creatures attempting
      to attack the target who fail their saves also feel a strong sense of pity
      toward the target, as if it were weak, pathetic, and not a threat. If the
      target breaks the spell by attacking, any creature that failed its save
      against the spell gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against the
      target for 1 minute.</p>
