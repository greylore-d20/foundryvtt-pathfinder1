      <p>This spell causes a small cloud of searing, choking ash to appear
      around the face of the target. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude
      saving throw or take 1d6 points of fire damage and be
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.A9KUpd2bsdZZsQqj]{blinded}.
      The victim must make a new save against damage and blindness for each
      round the spell persists. The target must have a discernable anatomy and
      no more than one head in order to be blinded. Undead, constructs, and
      creatures without eyes or who donâ€™t rely on sight to sense their
      surroundings can be damaged by this spell, but not blinded.</p><p>A
      moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the ash cloud in 2 rounds; a strong wind
      (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.</p><p>This spell does not
      function underwater.</p>
