    value: >-
      <p>You are able to harness the power of the storm to transport yourself a
      short distance, by taking the form of a furious, sizzling bolt of
      elemental electricity. You must either have line of sight to your
      destination or you must specify a direction and distance within range.
      Creatures and objects in the path of your passage take 1d8 points of
      electricity damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8). A successful Reflex
      save halves the damage.</p><p>If your path intersects with a solid object,
      you damage the barrier accordingly. If the damage is enough to break
      through the barrier, you continue beyond the barrier as long as the
      spell's range permits; otherwise, your movement stops in the square
      adjacent to the barrier and the effect ends.</p>
