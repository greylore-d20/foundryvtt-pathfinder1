It consists of a complex <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Flag-or-Banner\">banner</a> (depicting a family crest or symbol of the presiding noble), four bedrolls (for servants), four blankets (for servants), two cots (for nobles), two winter blankets (for nobles), 10 cups of <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Coffee\">coffee</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Outfit-Royal\">royal outfit</a>, two large tents, and a pavilion <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Tent\">tent</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone with a modicum of wilderness experience should recognize that the kit's contents are of little use on a prolonged journey. Oftentimes, the actual necessities of wilderness survival are left to the servants to handle.</p>\r\n\r\n"
