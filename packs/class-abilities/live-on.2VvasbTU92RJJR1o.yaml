      <p>At 5th level, you can use lay on hands as though you were a paladin of
      3 levels lower than your psychic level. You also gain access to mercies as
      though you were a paladin of 3 levels lower than your psychic level.</p>

      <p>You can target only yourself with lay on hands or mercies gained from
      this discipline. This stacks with lay on hands abilities gained from other
      sources.</p>
