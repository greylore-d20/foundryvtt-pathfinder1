      <p>At 8th level, as a swift action, you can cause jagged pieces of metal
      to explode outward from your body. These shards deal 1d6 points of
      piercing damage per two wizard levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures
      within a 10-foot-radius burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In
      addition, the twisted scraps of metal make the area difficult terrain
      until your next turn (at which time they disappear). You can use this
      ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 13th level and
      18th level. At 10th-level, the shrapnel bypasses damage reduction as if it
      were a magic weapon.</p>
