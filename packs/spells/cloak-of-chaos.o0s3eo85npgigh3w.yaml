    value: >-
      <p>A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from
      attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and
      causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become confused. This
      abjuration has four effects.</p><p>First, each warded creature gains a +4
      deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike
      <i>Protection from Law</i>, the benefit of this spell applies against all
      attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.</p><p>Second, each
      warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells
      cast by lawful creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects from
      possession and mental influence, just as <i>Protection from Law</i>
      does.</p><p>Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack
      against a warded creature, the offending attacker is confused for 1 round
      (Will save negates, as with the <i>confusion spell</i>, but against the
      save DC of <i>cloak of chaos</i>).</p>
