  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The crude metal of this massive hammer's head ends in multiple blunt
      spikes that help concentrate the force of a powerful swing down into a
      smaller, more focused area, allowing it to smash through armor with
      greater ease. Due to the tremendous size and weight of its head, an earth
      breaker is poorly balanced, and requires two hands to properly lift and
      control.</p>
