      <p>Your anguish bombs are filled with memories of sadness and regret.
      Creatures who take damage from your anguish bombs are also affected as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zt7cje76dck9hwp9]{Crushing Despair} for 1 round per
      alchemist level, or a single round if the target succeeds at a Will saving
      throw. An alchemist must be 10th level and have the anguish bomb class
      feature or the anguish bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
