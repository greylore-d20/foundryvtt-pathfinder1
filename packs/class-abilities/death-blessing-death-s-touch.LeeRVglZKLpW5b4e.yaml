  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you can make a melee touch attack against an opponent to
      deliver grim suffering. If you succeed, you inflict 1 temporary negative
      level on the target for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can activate this
      ability as a swift action upon hitting an opponent with a melee attack.
      These temporary negative levels stack. You gain no benefit from imposing
      these negative levels (such as the temporary hit points undead gain from
      enervation).</p>
