      "value": "<p>Some vigilantes ceaselessly tinker with their armor until the two seem inseparable; <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Vigilante%20Masked%20Maiden\">masked maidens</a> are particularly prone to developing this obsession. The vigilante can spend 1 day and 100 gp per class level modifying a set of armor with which he is proficient. The vigilante can conceal one set of unworn modified armor on his person as though it were an extraordinarily small object, as per Sleight of Hand, and can don modified armor without aid. The armor skin talent also applies to armor with this ability.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the vigilante treats modified armor’s enhancement bonus (if any) as a weapon enhancement bonus when making attacks with the armor’s gauntlets, if the armor has any.</p>\n<p>Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.</p>"
