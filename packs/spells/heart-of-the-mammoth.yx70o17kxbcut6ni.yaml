      <p>The target creature becomes stronger, hardier, and imbued with the
      courage of the greatest megafauna of the tundra. The spell grants a +8
      enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, immunity to fear, a +4
      morale bonus to Will saves, and doubles the critical threat range of all
      its attacks against creatures of the dragon type (this does not stack with
      Improved Critical, <i>keen edge</i>, or similar effects).</p>
