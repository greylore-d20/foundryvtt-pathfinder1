  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one ki
      power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical
      power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his ki pool. Once a
      ki power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some ki powers require the
      monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen.</p>

      <p>Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual ki power
      more than once.</p>
