  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While the barbarian is raging, all allies within 30 feet gain a +2
      morale bonus on Will saves. When attempting a Will save against a fear
      effect, all allies within this area can roll twice and use the better
      result.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the spire totem rage power and be at least 10th
      level to select this rage power.</p>
