      <p>Like <i>shield other</i>, <i>unwilling shield</i> creates a mystic
      connection between you and the target, but unlike <i>shield other</i>, the
      target shares the wounds that you receive. In addition, the link draws
      upon the target's life force to supplement your own defenses. You gain a
      +1 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. You take only half damage from
      all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that
      deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by
      the target. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as
      <i>charm</i> effects, ability damage, level draining, and death effects
      are not affected. If you take a reduction in hit points from a lowered
      Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target because it
      is not hit point damage.</p><p>When the spell ends, subsequent damage is
      no longer divided between you and the subject, but damage already split is
      not assigned to you.</p><p>If you and the target of the spell move out of
      range of each other, the spell remains active, but damage is no longer
      shared until you are once again within range of each other.</p>
