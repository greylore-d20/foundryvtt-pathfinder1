      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>The Aasen mortar is an indirect-fire advanced siege firearm, consisting
      of a heavy steel barrel, a loading mechanism, and a folding bipod stand,
      and is used to launch explosives to penetrate enemy defensive lines.</p>

      <p>Aiming the mortar is part of the standard action required to fire it.
      Reloading the mortar is a full-round action, and the user loads a
      grenade-like projectile into the breech of the weapon's steel barrel,
      along with a blank rifle round that propels the bomb when triggered. The
      weapon uses indirect fire to lob bombs in slow-moving, high arcs, and the
      user targets a specific square.</p>

      <p>Rules for indirect-fire siege weapons are found on page 160 of Ultimate
      Combat. Mortars can also be fired as direct-fire siege engines. When used
      for direct fire, they take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and their range
      increment is halved, but they do not have a minimum range. After the point
      of impact is determined, the shell explodes and deals 6d6 points of
      bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage to all creatures in a 30-foot
      radius (Reflex DC 20 for half ).</p>

      <p>An Aasen mortar has hardness 10 and 35 hit points; it fires special,
      finned fragmentation bombs that cost 10 gp each and weigh 4 pounds each.
      These bombs usually arrive on the battlefront in wooden cases containing 6
      mortars each.</p>
