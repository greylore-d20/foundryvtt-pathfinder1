  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and observation.
    When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in
    the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once
    the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area
    automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and
    sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct observation may allow
    a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is
    seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily
    allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way
    of those affected by the illusion.</p>
