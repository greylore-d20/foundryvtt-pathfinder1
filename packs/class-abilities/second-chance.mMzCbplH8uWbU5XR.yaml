      <p>At 8th level, you can give an enemy a second chance to correct the
      error of its ways. Once per day as a standard action, you can cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.qr6qcx8zqum6jhc4]{Atonement} as a spell-like
      ability, targeting a creature that has violated the tenets of a religion
      you both share or that freely desires to convert to your alignment. If
      costly material components are required for the atonement, you may choose
      to accept a permanent negative level as a sacrifice in place of those
      components. The target of this effect also receives the benefits of a cure
      serious wounds spell as part of the effects of the atonement.</p>
