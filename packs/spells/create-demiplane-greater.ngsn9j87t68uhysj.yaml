      <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.wniqskqkk0cubu9u]{create
      demiplane}, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the
      plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.r4znakt4ukpebsxg]{lesser create demiplane} or
      <em>create demiplane</em> (you do not need to create an entirely new plane
      using this spell), in which case it has aduration of 1 day/level.
      Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add to your
      demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any of the
      features described in <em>create demiplane</em>) with each casting of the
      spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.</p><p>Energy: Your
      plane gains the (minor) negative- or positive-dominant energy trait (see
      Elemental and Energy Traits, <em>GameMastery Guide</em> 186). A plane
      cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy
      traits.</p><p>Magic: Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic,
      impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait (see Magic Traits,
      <em>GameMastery Guide</em> 187). If you selected dead magic, you are
      trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as
      the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic,
      choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as "effects with
      the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire" or "death spells and spells
      from the Death or Repose domains." A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded
      for the same kinds of spells.</p><p>Morphic: You may use <em>move
      earth</em> at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell's normal
      casting time, and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by
      twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to
      affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this
      is only half normal.</p><p>Portal: Your demiplane gains a permanent
      <em>gate</em> to one location on another plane, which can only be used for
      planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you.</p><p>This
      <em>gate</em> is always open and usable from both sides, but you can
      secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around
      it).</p><p>Time: By default, time passes at the normal rate in your
      demiplane. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane have the
      erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait
      (see Time, <em>GameMastery Guide</em> 185).</p><p>You can make this spell
      permanent with the @Compendium[pf1.spells.nsxngq65mbrzgwnm]{permanency}
      spell, at a cost of 22,500 gp. If you have cast <em>create</em> greater
      demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area
      requires its own <em>permanency</em> spell.</p>
