  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. If you
    succeed at a save against an enchantment effect, you identify the effect as
    if you had succeeded at a Spellcraft check to do so. Furthermore, you can
    choose to act as if you had failed your saving throw. If you do so, you gain
    a +20 bonus on Bluff checks to convince others that you failed your save and
    are under the enchantment's effects. A creature that attempts to use magic
    to detect this ruse or to make you speak truthfully about it must succeed at
    a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level) to do so.</p>
