  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>symbol of death</i>, except all creatures
    within 60 feet of the <i>symbol of healing</i> instead are bathed in
    positive energy and heal 2d8 points + 1 point of damage per caster level
    (maximum +15). Undead and other creatures harmed by positive energy instead
    take 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15); a Will
    save reduces this damage by half. A creature can only be healed or harmed by
    the symbol once in any 24-hour period. Once triggered, the symbol remains
    active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Symbol of healing</i> can
    be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 10th level
    or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.</p>
