  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This specialized bolas can be used to perform ranged trip combat
      maneuvers against creatures far larger than the wielder. It consists of a
      pair of metal weights connected by a silk rope 20 feet long. Because of
      the great size and weight of the bolas, you need both hands to swing it
      around your head, and considerable time to get the weights up to speed.
      Making a ranged attack with it is a full-round action. You can use a dire
      bolas to trip a creature whose size is up to three size categories larger
      than yours.</p>
