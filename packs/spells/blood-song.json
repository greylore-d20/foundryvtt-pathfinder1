As part of the casting, the caster must shed some of his blood (or an equivalent humor). If the caster isn't susceptible to bleed damage, regardless of the reason, he can't cast <i>blood song</i>. For each spell that is imbued using <i>blood song</i>, the caster loses 5 hit points, which can't be regained by any means until the spell ends or is discharged.</p>",
