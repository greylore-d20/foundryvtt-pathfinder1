      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, the cavalier can direct multiple animals with one forceful command. The cavalier can handle a number of nonhostile, riderless animals equal to his cavalier level with a single use of the Handle Animal skill, so long as the commanded animals can see or hear the cavalier. The handled animals must all be ordered to perform the same trick. If an animal in the group does not know the trick the cavalier is commanding them to perform, the cavalier is considered to be pushing that animal. The cavalier cannot use this ability on animals more than two size categories smaller than he is. Using this ability requires a move action, though if the cavalier is pushing any animal as described above, it requires a full-round action.</p>"
