  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent rolls twice when making Swim checks and
      takes the better result. If she already rolls twice while making a Swim
      check because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight bonus
      on both of those rolls instead. If the character is under the effect of a
      spell or ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse
      result, she only needs to roll 1d20 while making Swim checks.</p>
