  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When this spell is active, you feel a mental pull in the direction of
      any active or operable portal leading to another plane within range of the
      spell. If multiple portals are present, you are pulled only to the nearest
      one. If moving causes you to become closer to a different portal, you
      become drawn to that one instead. The spell gives you the direction of the
      portal only, not a route. Once you are within 10 feet of the portal, you
      no longer feel the pull, only the portal's presence. The spell does not
      pinpoint or otherwise reveal hidden portals, nor does it do anything to
      aid in opening or operating them.</p>
