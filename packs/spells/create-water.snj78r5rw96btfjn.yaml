  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain
      water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain
      the liquid, or in an area three times as large--possibly creating a
      downpour or filling many small receptacles. This water disappears after 1
      day if not consumed.</p><p>Note: Conjuration spells can't create
      substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per
      gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs
      about 60 pounds.</p>
