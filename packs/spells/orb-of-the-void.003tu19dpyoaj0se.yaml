      <p>You create a small weightless sphere of pure negative energy. As a move
      action, you can move it up to 30 feet per round in any direction. If it
      enters a space with a living creature, it stops moving for the round and
      that creature gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Any creature
      passing through or ending its turn in the space occupied by the sphere
      gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Twenty-four hours after
      gaining a negative level from the sphere, the subject must make a
      Fortitude saving throw (the DC of this save is equal to the DC of this
      spell) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level
      is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent.  If more
      than one orb (from different castings of the spell) enters the same space,
      the orbs automatically fuse together. The resulting orb uses the higher of
      the two orbs' DCs as its DC and whichever duration has more time left. If
      the orbs are from different casters, each must make an opposed
      Intelligence check to move the sphere.  An undead creature that passes
      through or ends its turn in the space occupied by the orb gains 2d4 x 5
      temporary hit points for 1 hour.</p>
