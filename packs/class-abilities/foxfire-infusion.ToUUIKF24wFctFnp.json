This effect occurs even if the foe doesn’t take damage, as long as the attack overcomes spell resistance (if any). You can reduce the blast’s damage by half to increase the DC of this saving throw by 2.</p>\n<p>A creature can remove the revealing flames early by taking a full-round action to extinguish them.</p>"
