  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can summon the spirit of a great warrior ancestor and allow it to
      possess you, becoming a mighty warrior yourself. You gain a +4 enhancement
      bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, and a +4 natural armor
      bonus to AC. Your base attack bonus while possessed equals your oracle
      level (which may give you additional attacks), and you gain the Improved
      Critical feat with a weapon of your choice. You can use this ability for 1
      round for every 2 oracle levels you possess. This duration does not need
      to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-round increments.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
