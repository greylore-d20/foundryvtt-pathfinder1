      "value": "<p>You were exposed at a young age (perhaps even before you were born) to the alien species known as the hive, but this exposure did not result in a full-blown infestation by these otherworldly monsters. Others (including animals) find the unsightly spines and rough growths that periodically emerge from your flesh to be disturbing and distracting, and you take a –4 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, and Ride checks. Once per day as a standard action, you can cough up an ovoid, leathery sphere that can be hurled as a flask of acid, though it becomes inert after 24 hours.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you gain the benefits of @Compendium[pf1.spells.pau0ejk30fs1eebl]{Endure Elements} in hot environments and are immune to infestations (save for those from the hive itself ).</p>\n<p>At 10th level, your skin deformities grow numerous enough to increase your natural armor bonus by 1.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you gain acid resistance 20.</p>"
