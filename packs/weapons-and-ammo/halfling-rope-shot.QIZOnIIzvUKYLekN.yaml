  description:
    value: >-
      <p>One end of this short rope has a sling bullet wrapped in a monkey's
      fist knot, and the other end is tied in a small loop. You wrap the loop
      around your wrist as a full-round action and swing the weighted end like a
      flail. If the loop is properly attached to your wrist and you drop the
      rope-shot or are disarmed, you can recover it as a swift action. Removing
      the weapon's loop is a full-round action. You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of
      Hand checks made to conceal a rope-shot on your body. Halflings treat
      rope-shots as martial weapons.</p>
