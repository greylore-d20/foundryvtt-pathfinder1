    value: >-
      <p>When you would be hit by an attack that requires an attack roll, or
      when you are within an area of effect that allows you to attempt a Reflex
      saving throw, with a single touch you compel the target to throw itself in
      front of the blow or shield you from the effect.</p><p>If an attack roll
      triggered this spell's casting, the target takes the damage instead of
      you, even if the attack roll would not normally hit the target's Armor
      Class.</p><p>If an area of effect that allows you to attempt a Reflex save
      triggered this spell's casting, the target instead grants you cover
      against the effect (+2 bonus on Reflex saves) if it is your size or
      smaller, or improved cover (+4 bonus on Reflex saves and improved evasion
      against the effect) if it is larger than you. The target automatically
      fails its Reflex save against the effect but can still benefit from
      improved evasion and similar mitigating effects. After taking damage, the
      target is shaken for 1 minute. If the target was already shaken, it
      becomes frightened instead.</p>
