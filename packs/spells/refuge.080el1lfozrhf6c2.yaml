  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, you create powerful magic in a specially
      prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport its
      possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once
      the item is so enhanced, you must give it willingly to a creature and at
      the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is
      used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the
      same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this
      is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a
      maximum of the character's heavy load) are instantly transported to your
      abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar or animal
      companion that is touching the subject).</p><p>You can alter the spell
      when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the
      possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You
      will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item
      possessor at the time the <i>refuge</i> spell is discharged, but once you
      decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or
      not to be transported.</p>
