  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You hurl a pure white or golden spear of light from your holy symbol,
      affecting any one target within range as a ranged touch attack.  An evil
      creature struck by the spear takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster
      levels (maximum 5d8). An evil outsider instead takes 1d6 points of damage
      per caster level (maximum 10d6) and is blinded for 1 round. A successful
      Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the blinded effect. This
      spell deals only half damage to creatures that are neither evil nor good,
      and they are not blinded. The spear has no effect on good creatures.</p>
