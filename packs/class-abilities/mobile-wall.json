      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, the cavalier receives @Compendium[pf1.feats.Mz8ZG6nqW3NKFZhK]{Step Up} as a bonus feat. He can use this feat while mounted by succeeding at a DC 15 Ride check, directing his mount to move rather than himself. The cavalier gains a +1 bonus to his CMD against attempts to tumble through squares he threatens. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by an additional +1.</p>"
