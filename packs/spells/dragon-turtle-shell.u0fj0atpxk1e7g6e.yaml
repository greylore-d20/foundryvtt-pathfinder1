  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you are struck by an opponent's natural attacks, the damage is
      resolved as if the attack came from a creature one size smaller per 5
      caster levels (maximum of four size categories smaller at CL 20th). Refer
      to Table 3-1 in the <i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Bestiary</i></i> to determine an
      attack's altered base damage. If the creature's natural attack deals
      nonstandard damage, refer instead to the Improved Natural Attack feat on
      page 315 of the <i>Bestiary</i>. It is not possible to reduce the base
      damage of a creature's natural attack below 1d2 with this spell.</p>
