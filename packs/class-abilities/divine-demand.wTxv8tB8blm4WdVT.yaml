    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you can petition your divine patron for far greater power
      than you deserve. Activating this ability is a swift action that you must
      use as you cast a spell that has a reduced (but not negated) effect on a
      successful save. The saving throw DC of the spell increases by 2, and you
      gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with
      the spell. Any creature that succeeds at the saving throw instead avoids
      the effect entirely. If half or more of the targets are unaffected, you
      become shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spellâ€™s level. If all of
      the targets are unaffected, you instead lose the ability to cast divine
      spells, channel energy, and use domain powers for 1d4+1 rounds; you can
      end this loss as a full-round action by loudly apologizing to your patron
      deity as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can
      use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one additional time per
      day for every 4 levels beyond 6th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Divine Presence power of the Glory Domain or
      the Leadership power of the Nobility Domain.</p>
