  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Invisible bands of force encircle vital areas of the target. The bands
    resist crushing forces and impacts without interfering with movement. The
    target gains DR 2/piercing or slashing and takes half damage from
    constriction, falling, and being buried, as well as from similar crushing
    effects such as <i>crushing hand</i>. Grapple checks for attacks other than
    constricting (such as pinning or swallowing whole) are not affected. Once
    the spell has blocked 12 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of
    120 points at 10th level), it is discharged. The bands have no effect on
    incorporeal attacks unless they deal damage from constriction or crushing,
    or unless the attacks would be subject to damage reduction.</p>
