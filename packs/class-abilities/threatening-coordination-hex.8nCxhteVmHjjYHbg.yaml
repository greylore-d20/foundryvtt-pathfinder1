    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to view the shaman’s allies
      as obstacles. The target treats squares adjacent to the shaman’s allies as
      difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s level, or
      for 1 round if the target succeeds at a Will saving throw.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, a creature affected by this hex
      cannot be the target of it again for 24 hours.</p>
