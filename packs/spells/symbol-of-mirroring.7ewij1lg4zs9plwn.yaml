  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>symbol of death</i>, except it instead creates
    one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These
    duplicates function as <i>mirror image</i>, moving with the original
    creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an
    illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creature's turn. The
    images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol,
    and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active
    for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Symbol of mirroring</i> can be
    made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 10th level or
    higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.</p>
