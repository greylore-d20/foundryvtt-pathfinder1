If you are wearing Hellknight plate or a signifer mask, your command’s target takes an additional –2 penalty on its saving throw to resist the order (regardless of the target’s alignment; this stacks with the penalty chaotic creatures take).</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
