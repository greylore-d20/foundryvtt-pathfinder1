    "shortDescription": "<p>You charge a weapon with a magic rune of fire. When the wielder of the weapon successfully strikes a foe in melee with the weapon, the wielder can discharge the rune as a swift action to deal 1d4+1 points of fire damage to the target. This damage isn't multiplied on a critical hit. If the target has spell resistance, you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance when the rune is discharged. If the rune is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled; otherwise, the rune deals damage normally.  For every 2 caster levels beyond 3rd the caster possesses, the rune deals an additional 1d4+1 points of fire damage (2d4+2 at caster level 5th, 3d4+3 at 7th, and so on) to a maximum of 5d4+5 points of fire damage at caster level 11th.</p>",
