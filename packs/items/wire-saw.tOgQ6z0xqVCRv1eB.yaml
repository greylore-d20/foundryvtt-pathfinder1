      (common)</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This flexible saw consists of an
      abrasive wire hooked to two metal rings. By feeding the wire around a
      deadbolt or small door bar, you can use the rings to quietly saw through
      the obstruction. The saw takes 10 minutes to cut through a 2-inch piece of
      wood or a 1-inch iron bar. A wire saw can cut through items with hardness
      10 or less. After five uses, the abrasive wire is worn smooth and must be
      replaced (costing 25 gp).</p><p>Adamantine Wire Saw: This works twice as
      fast as a normal saw when cutting materials with hardness 10 or less, or
      at normal speed when cutting materials with hardness 11–20. Replacing an
      adamantine wire saw’s wire costs 145 gp.</p>
