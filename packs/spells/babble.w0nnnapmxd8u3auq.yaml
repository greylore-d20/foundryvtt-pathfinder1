    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes the target to break into a fit of bizarre,
      uncontrollable babbling. The target also becomes nauseated. If the target
      succeeds at its save, the effects end. If not, the creature continues
      babbling and is nauseated for the entire duration.  Creatures within 30
      feet of the subject that can hear the target's babbling must succeed at a
      Will save or become fascinated for as long as the babbling persists. Once
      a creature's fascination ends, it can't become fascinated by the same
      instance of <i>babble</i> again.  Creatures with an Intelligence score of
      2 or lower aren't affected by this spell.</p>
