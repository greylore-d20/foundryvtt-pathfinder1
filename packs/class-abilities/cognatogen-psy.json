      "value": "<p>Once per day, you can create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. When you imbibe a cognatogen, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 1 minute per psychic level.</p>\n<p>In addition, while the cognatogen is in effect, you take a –2 penalty to one of your physical ability scores. If the cognatogen enhances your Intelligence, it applies a penalty to your Strength. If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the alchemist’s mutagen ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide&nbsp;28). When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen.</p>\n<p>If you have both alchemist and psychic levels, these levels stack to determine the duration of your cognatogen and the DC of the save a non-alchemist must attempt if he drinks your cognatogen.</p>\n<p>If you gain discoveries, you can take the grand cognatogen and greater cognatogen discoveries to improve your cognatogen.</p>\n<p>The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens. However, even if you have alchemist levels, the duration of your cognatogen remains 1 minute per level (instead of 10 minutes per level) and you can still create only one per day (instead of an unlimited number) unless you also possess the cognatogen discovery.</p>"
