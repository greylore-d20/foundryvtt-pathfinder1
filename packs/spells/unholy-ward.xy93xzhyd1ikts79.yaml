      <p>This spell grants you resistance to the holy powers of good-aligned
      deities and their servants. You resist 10 points of damage from holy
      sources (divine power damage from <i>flame strike</i>, additional damage
      from smite evil, channeled positive energy, etc.), provided they originate
      from a good-aligned source or a servant of a good-aligned god. You ignore
      a maximum of 10 points of damage per caster level, at which point the
      spell ends.</p>
