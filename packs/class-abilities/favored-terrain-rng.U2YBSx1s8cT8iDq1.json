The ranger gains a +2 bonus on <em>initiative</em> checks and <em>Knowledge</em> (geography), <em>Perception</em>, <em>Stealth</em>, and <em>Survival</em> <em>skill checks</em> when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his <em>favored terrain</em> normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>\n<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional <em>favored terrain</em>. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and <em>initiative</em> bonus in any one <em>favored terrain</em> (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>\n<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of <em>favored terrain</em>, the rangerâ€™s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<hr>\n<table><caption>Table: Ranger Favored Terrains</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Favored Terrains</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cold (ice, glaciers, snow, and tundra)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Desert (sand and wastelands)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forest (coniferous and deciduous)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jungle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mountain (including hills)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plains</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Planes (pick one, other than <em>Material Plane</em>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Swamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Underground (caves and dungeons)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Urban (buildings, streets, and sewers)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Water (above and below the surface)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
