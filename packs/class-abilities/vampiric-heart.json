      "value": "<p>The vampire hunter gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">energy resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to half his level against cold and electricity. Additionally, the vampire hunterâ€™s heartbeat is undetectable. Any ability that detects or identifies the living, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Lifesense-Su-\">lifesense</a>&nbsp;ability, does not perceive him. At 16th level, once per day when reduced to 0 or fewer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;while this focus is activated, the vampire hunter immediately turns gaseous (as the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous Form}) for up to a number of rounds equal to half his level and he gains a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>&nbsp;equal to half his level. The vampire hunter can leave&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form\">gaseous form</a>&nbsp;at any time without losing these&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>. This effect ends after these rounds have elapsed, after the vampire hunter loses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>, or once this focus is no longer active, at which point the vampire hunter immediately becomes corporeal and loses these&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>. If he has not received&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;in the interim, this returns the vampire hunter to the number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;he had after the attack or effect that triggered this ability.</p>"
