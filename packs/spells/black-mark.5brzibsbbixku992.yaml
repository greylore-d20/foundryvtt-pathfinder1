    value: >-
      <p>You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark's exact
      appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The
      <em>black mark</em> functions as a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.3jaumkutti1ytulq]{mark of justice}, and
      when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or
      in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the
      <em>black mark</em> is active, the target is affected as if subject to
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.zijz3jxq5xauhpd0]{nature's exile}, but
      all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are
      made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic
      animals are not.</p>
