      <p>Black powder is the key explosive component within a firearm that
      enables it to function, but in larger amounts this alchemical material can
      be quite destructive on its own as well. A single dose of black powder is
      enough to power a single shot from most one-handed and two-handed
      firearms, while 10 doses are required to fire a cannon.</p><h3>Alchemical
