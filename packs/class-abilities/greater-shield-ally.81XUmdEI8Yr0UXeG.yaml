  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 12th level, whenever an ally is within an eidolonâ€™s reach, the ally
      receives a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus
      on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase
      to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless,
      paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.</p>
