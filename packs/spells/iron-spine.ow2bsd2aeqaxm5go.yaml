  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You launch an ingot of iron at the target. If you succeed at a ranged
    touch attack, the target's skeleton or exoskeleton turns into jagged shards
    of cold iron. Whenever the target moves, it takes 1d6 points of piercing
    damage and is sickened for 1 round as metal spines stab into its flesh. This
    damage is subject to damage reduction, but it overcomes damage reduction as
    though it were a weapon of cold iron and magic. A creature affected by this
    spell can choose to remain motionless to avoid taking damage. Creatures with
    DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron and magic affected by this spell are nauseated
    instead of sickened. This spell has no effect on a creature that has neither
    a skeleton nor a hard carapace.</p>
