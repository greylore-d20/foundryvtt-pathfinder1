  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A barbed spear is a 10-foot-long polearm with a fourpronged head
      similar to a caltrop. The head is connected to the pole by a single weak
      bolt, giving the weapon the fragile condition. When you use a barbed spear
      to attack a creature that is prone, flying above you, or at least one size
      category larger than you, you can make a melee attack with a -4 penalty to
      jam the barbed head into the target's foot. If you're successful, the
      target takes 1 point of damage and the barbed head breaks off in the
      target's foot. The barb then acts as a caltrop, wounding the creature's
      foot and halving its speed. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or
      until the creature is treated with a successful DC 15 Heal check or
      receives at least 1 point of magical healing. Like caltrops, barbed spears
      may not work against unusual opponents. A barbed spear that embeds its
      caltrop-like head into a target's foot gains the broken condition, and
      can't be used as a weapon until it's repaired.</p>
