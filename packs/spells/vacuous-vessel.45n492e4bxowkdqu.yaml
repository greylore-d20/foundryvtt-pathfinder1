      <p>This spell makes a single bag, chest, sack, or other container look and
      feel empty. The container must be no larger than 1 cubic foot per caster
      level or the spell fails. Anyone peering into or reaching into the
      container must succeed at a Will save or perceive the container as being
      completely empty. All items within the container when the spell was cast
      are still present, but they can't be noticed unless removed from the
      bag-such as by someone who can perceive them, or who upends the
      container.  Casting <i>vacuous vessel</i> on another container or placing
      a new item in the existing container immediately dismisses the currently
      active spell.</p>
