  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Time spent in the bright light of day has partially inured the
      alchemist to its effects. When the alchemist would normally take
      Constitution damage as a result of vulnerability to sunlight, he can
      attempt a DC 11 Fortitude saving throw to negate the effects. The DC of
      this saving throw increases by 1 for each hour after the first spent in
      sunlight within the last 24 hours.</p>
