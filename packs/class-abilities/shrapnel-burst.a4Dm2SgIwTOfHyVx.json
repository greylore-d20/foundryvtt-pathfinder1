      "value": "<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic pg. 87</p><p>At 8th level, as a swift action, you can cause jagged pieces of metal to explode outward from your body. These shards deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two wizard levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In addition, the twisted scraps of metal make the area difficult terrain until your next turn (at which time they disappear). You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 13th level and 18th level. At 10th-level, the shrapnel bypasses damage reduction as if it were a magic weapon.</p>"
