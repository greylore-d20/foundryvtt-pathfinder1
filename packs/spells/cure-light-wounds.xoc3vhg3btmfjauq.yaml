  shortDescription: >-
    <p>When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy
    that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
    Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them
    instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell
    resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.</p>
