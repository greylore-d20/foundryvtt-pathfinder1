  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Some practitioners of psychic techniques extend their training to
      improve their bodies as well as their minds. When the psychic casts a
      linked transmutation spell, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to
      gain a +2 bonus on her next Reflex or Fortitude save.</p>
