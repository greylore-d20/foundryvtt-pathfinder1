  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Choose a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower with a casting
      time of 1 standard action or less. As part of the action of casting
      <i>spite</i>, you cast the associated spell and bind it into a defensive
      ward in the form of a tattoo, birthmark, or wart somewhere upon your body.
      The next time you are hit by a melee attack or a combat maneuver is used
      successfully against you, the stored spell is triggered against your foe.
      You do not need to succeed on a touch attack to affect the target, but in
      all other respects the spell is treated as though you had cast it
      normally. If the attacking creature is not a valid target for the spell,
      the stored spell is lost with no effect.</p><p>You can have only one
      <i>spite</i> spell in effect at a time; if you cast this spell a second
      time, the previous spell effect ends.</p>
