    value: >-
      <p>You sense whether a well-known creature you can clearly visualize is
      within a 20-mile radius of your current location, as well as the distance
      and direction to the creature in relation to you. You also discern whether
      the creature is moving, and its direction, speed, and mode of movement.
      The radius you can sense increases by 5 miles for every two caster levels
      you have above 10th (to a maximum of a 45-mile radius at 20th level).
      Anything that would prevent <i>locate creature</i> from finding a creature
      also prevents <i>find quarry</i> from doing so.</p>
