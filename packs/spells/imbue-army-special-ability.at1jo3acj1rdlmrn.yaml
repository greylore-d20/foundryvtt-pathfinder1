      <p>You imbue the target with an army special ability (see page 242 of
      <i>Ultimate</i> Campaign) possessed by the army's commander. The army is
      treated as if it consists of units who all possess the chosen special
      ability. This special ability is in addition to any special abilities the
      army inherently possessed prior to the casting of the spell.</p>
