  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This heavy crossbow has a winch mounted below the stock. Up to 50 feet
      of silk rope can be wound onto the winch as a full-round action that
      provokes attacks of opportunity. The wound rope can be attached to a
      @Compendium[pf1.weapons-and-ammo.84twkW8rwnUEX4EY]{Barbed Bolt} or
      grappling bolt<sup>UE</sup> as part of a loading action. After firing such
      a bolt, the wielder can use the winch to retract the rope or pull herself
      along the rope if the bolt is secure. When used with a barbed bolt, the
      winch provides a +2 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks to pull the
      target toward you. When used with a grappling bolt<sup>UE</sup>, the winch
      provides a +2 bonus on
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.ZAwjVOTwsBpZRgw4]{Climb}
