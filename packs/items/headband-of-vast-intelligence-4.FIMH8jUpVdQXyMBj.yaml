      <p>This intricate gold headband is decorated with several small blue and
      deep purple gemstones.</p>

      <p>The headband grants the wearer an <em>enhancement bonus</em> to
      <em>Intelligence</em> of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability
      bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. A headband of vast
      intelligence has one skill associated with it per +2 bonus it grants.
      After being worn for 24 hours, the headband grants a number of skill ranks
      in those skills equal to the wearerâ€™s total <em>Hit Dice</em>. These ranks
      do not stack with the ranks a creature already possesses. These skills are
      chosen when the headband is created. If no skill is listed, the headband
      is assumed to grant skill ranks in randomly determined <em>Knowledge</em>
      skills.</p>
