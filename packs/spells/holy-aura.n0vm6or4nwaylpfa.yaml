      <p>A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them
      from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures,
      and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the
      subjects. This abjuration has four effects.</p><p>First, each warded
      creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on
      saves. Unlike <i>Protection from Evil</i>, this benefit applies against
      all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.</p><p>Second,
      each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and
      spells cast by evil creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects the
      recipient from possession and mental influence, just as <i>Protection from
      Evil</i> does.</p><p>Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee
      attack against a creature warded by a <i>holy aura</i>, the offending
      attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as <i>blindness/deafness,</i>
      but against <i>holy aura</i>'s save DC).</p>
