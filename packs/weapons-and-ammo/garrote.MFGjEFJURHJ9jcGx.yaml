  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A garrote is a length of wire or thin rope with wooden handles at both
      ends. The wire is placed across a victim's throat and crossed behind the
      neck; when the handles are pulled tight, the garrote strangles him. In
      order for you to use a garrote, your opponent must be helpless or unaware
      of you. You must make a grapple check (though you avoid the -4 penalty for
      not having two hands free) to successfully begin garroting your opponent.
      Sneak attack damage does not apply to a garrote. Your garroted opponent
      must make a concentration check (DC 20 + your CMB + level of the spell
      he's casting) to cast a spell with a verbal component, use a command word
      item, or use any magic requiring speech. You gain the following additional
      option when grappling with a garrote.</p><p><em>Choke</em>: You cut off
      your target's air supply so he has to hold his breath (see Suffocation on
      page 445 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, and the Swim skill
      on page 108). Any round you do not maintain the choke, your opponent can
      take a breath and restart when he has to begin making Constitution
      checks.</p>
