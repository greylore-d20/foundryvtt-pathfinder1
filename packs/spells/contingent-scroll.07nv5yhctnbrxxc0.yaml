      <p>You transfer the power of a scroll to the target so that it comes into
      effect under some condition you dictate. Casting this spell destroys the
      scroll, but allows the spell in it to be triggered in a manner similar to
      the contingency spell. The spell on the scroll must be a spell on your
      spell list, it must affect the target of this spell (the target of this
      spell is considered the caster of the scroll), and its level must be no
      higher than onefourth your caster level (maximum 5th level).</p><p>The
      writing on the scroll appears on the target’s skin in any location you
      desire; this writing does not harm or interfere with the target in any
      way, and doesn’t need to be on exposed skin to function. For example, you
      could make the writing appear on under a target’s clothing. The writing on
      the target’s skin can be deciphered and identified as if it were the
      scroll it was copied from. Damaging the target has no effect on the stored
      spell, but effects such as erase that target magical writing can affect
      it.</p><p>The condition needed to bring the spell into effect must be
      clear, although it can be general. In all cases, this spell immediately
      brings into effect the scroll’s spell, the latter being effectively cast
      instantaneously when the trigger occurs. If a complicated or convoluted
      condition is prescribed, the whole spell combination (the contingent
      scroll and the scroll’s spell) might fail when triggered. The scroll’s
      spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether
      you want it to at that moment.</p><p>This spell counts as a contingency
      spell for the purpose of having multiple contingent effects on a creature
      at the same time.</p>
