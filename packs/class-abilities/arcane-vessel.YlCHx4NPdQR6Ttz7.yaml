  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, whenever the cavalier gains a bonus on attack rolls,
      saving throws, or damage rolls from a spell or spell-like ability cast by
      another creature, the cavalier also gains a number of temporary hit points
      equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability. Temporary hit
      points gained from this ability from different spells stack, but only to a
      maximum number of temporary hit points equal to the cavalierâ€™s level.
      These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.</p>
