  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman selects any one hex normally available through the witchâ€™s
      hex class feature. She treats her shaman level as her witch level when
      determining the powers and abilities of the hex.</p>

      <p>She uses her Wisdom modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier for
      the hex. She cannot select major hexes or grand hexes using this
      ability.</p>

      <p>The shaman cannot select a witch hex that has the same name as a shaman
      hex.</p>
