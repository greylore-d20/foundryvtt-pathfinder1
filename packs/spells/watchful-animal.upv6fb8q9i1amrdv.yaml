  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You place a scrying sensor on your animal companion or familiar. This
      allows the animal companion or familiar to function as if it were an
      insect summoned by the <i>greater insect spy</i> spell. The animal
      companion or familiar does not change shape, nor does it lose the ability
      to make its own decisions, but it receives orders and gives answers as per
      insects summoned by that spell, and you can sense its direction and
      distance and receive sensory input from it as with that spell.</p>
