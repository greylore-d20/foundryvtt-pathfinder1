      spearhead, several short branches project from the shaft at irregular
      intervals, each angled forward and tipped with a smaller leaf like blade.
      When you make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you gain a +2
      bonus on attack rolls. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your
      Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with
      an elven branched spear sized for you, even though it isn't a light
      weapon. Elves treat elven branched spears as martial weapons.</p>
