      <p>The eidolon is infused with magic, allowing it to treat all of its
      natural attacks as if they were magic for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction.</p>

      <p>If the summoner is 10th level or higher, all of the eidolonâ€™s natural
      attacks are treated as the alignment of the eidolon for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.</p>
