      <p>As an Arcane crafter, you gain a bonus feat at 3rd level, which must be
      an item creation feat or metamagic feat. You must still meet all
      prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. When
      using <em>metamagic feats</em> to create magic items, your skill and
      understanding of the principles involved in the itemâ€™s creation give you a
      +2 bonus on the skill check made to create the item.</p>
