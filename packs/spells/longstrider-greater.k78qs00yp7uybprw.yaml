      <p>This functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.hosf489xyoexmp57]{Longstrider}, except it gives you
      a +20-foot enhancement bonus to your base speed and a +10-foot enhancement
      bonus to your other modes of movement (burrow, climb, fly, swim, and so
      on). It does not affect movement modes you do not actually have-for
      example, if you do not have a swim speed, this spell does not grant you a
      swim speed.</p>
