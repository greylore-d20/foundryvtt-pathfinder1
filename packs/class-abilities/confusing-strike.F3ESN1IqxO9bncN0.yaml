    value: >-
      <p>When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, the opponent
      must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become confused for 1d4+1
      rounds. A successful saving throw reduces the duration to 1 round. The DC
      for this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the investigatorâ€™s level +
      his Intelligence modifier. Constructs, mindless creatures, oozes, plants,
      undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits are
      not affected by this ability.</p>

      <p>An investigator must be at least 19th level to select this talent.</p>
