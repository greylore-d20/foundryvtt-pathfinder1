  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move
      faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging
      song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (Core
      Rulebook 170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a
      hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue.</p>

      <p>The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the
      hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is
      expended for that hour.</p>
