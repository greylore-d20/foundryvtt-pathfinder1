      "value": "<p>The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a battle ward. The next time a foe makes an attack roll against the target, the ward activates and grants a +3 deflection bonus to the warded creature’s AC. Each subsequent time she’s attacked, the defection bonus reduces by 1 (to +2 for the second time she’s attacked and +1 for the third). The ward fades when the bonus is reduced to +0 or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the ward’s starting bonus increases to +4.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, it increases to +5.</p>\n<p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>"
