    value: >-
      <p>Generally composed of meat, hard cheese, fruits and vegetables, nut and
      bean pastes, and vital herbs, space rations are dehydrated and then kept
      extremely dry in order to maximize preservation and storage efficiency. A
      single serving feeds a Medium character for 1 day, but unless an equal
      weight of water is added to the rations, the character eating them becomes
      fatigued until she drinks enough water.</p>
