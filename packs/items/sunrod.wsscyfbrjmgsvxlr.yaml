      gold-tipped iron rod glows brightly when struck (a standard
      action).</p><p>It sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the
      light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area
      (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light).</p><p>A
      sunrod does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light.
      It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and
      worthless.</p><h3>Alchemical Recipe</h3><p><strong>Recipe</strong> (2
