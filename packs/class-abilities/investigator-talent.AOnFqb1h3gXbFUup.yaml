  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an
      investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator
      talent can only be selected once.</p><p>Investigator talents tagged with
      <em>Studied Combat/Strike</em> tag add effects to an investigatorâ€™s
      studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied
      to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is
      dealt.</p>
