      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>When launched from a ballista, this specialized bolt unfurls into a
      large net. An attack with entangling ammunition is a ranged touch attack,
      but it's only effective within one range increment. If it hits, the target
      is entangled, but the attack deals no damage.</p>

      <p>An entangled creature can escape with a successful <b>DC 20 Escape
      Artist check</b> (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can
      be burst with a successful <b>DC 25 Strength check</b> (also a full-round
      action).</p>

      <p>Entangling ammunition is useful only against creatures within one size
      category of the firing ballista.</p>
