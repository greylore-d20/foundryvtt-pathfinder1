    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, a paladinâ€™s weapons are treated as good-aligned for the
      purposes of overcoming <em>Damage Reduction</em>. Any attack made against
      an enemy within 10 feet of her is treated as good-aligned for the purposes
      of overcoming <em>Damage Reduction</em>.</p>

      <p>This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she
      is <em>unconscious</em> or dead.</p>
