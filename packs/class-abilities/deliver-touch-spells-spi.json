      "value": "<p>The phantom can deliver touch spells for the spiritualist when fully manifested in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. The spiritualist and the phantom need not be in contact to accomplish this, but the phantom must be within 30 feet and the spiritualist must be able to see the phantom. If the spiritualist is 12th level or higher, the phantom can deliver touch spells within 50 feet of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can cast the spell, and then the phantom can deliver the touch as an immediate action.</p>\n<p>If the touch spell deals damage, the phantom must make the attack roll. The phantom can’t hold the charge of a touch spell cast by the spiritualist using this ability. If the spell is delivered to the phantom, it must touch a target or the spell is lost.</p>\n<p>If the spell allows you to touch up to six willing targets, the phantom can accomplish this with an immediate action, but all of the willing targets must be within the phantom’s melee reach at the time.</p>"
