      "value": "<p>You find yourself drawn to the luster of wealthy living. You must wear fine nonmagical clothing and jewelry worth at least 50 gp + 100 gp per character level you have beyond 1st. If you do not have sufficient wealth to purchase this additional equipment, you feel a strong desire (but are not compelled) to sell existing items or steal from others to obtain it. You are sickened whenever you do not meet this requirement; you are also sickened for 24 hours after anything worth 25 gp x your character level or more is taken from you against your will. Use Magic Device becomes a class skill for you.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you gain a +4 insight bonus on Appraise checks, Spellcraft checks to identify magic items, and Use Magic Device checks.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you add @Compendium[pf1.spells.rxk9rk8gvqau3f3l]{Fabricate} to your list of spells known.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you add half your oracle level to your CMD against stealAPG&nbsp;combat maneuvers and to the DC of Sleight of Hand checks to take items from you.</p>"
