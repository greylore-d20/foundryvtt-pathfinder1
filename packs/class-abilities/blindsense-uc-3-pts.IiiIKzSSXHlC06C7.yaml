      <p>The eidolon’s senses become incredibly acute, giving it blindsense with
      a range of 30 feet. This ability allows the eidolon to pinpoint the
      location of creatures that it can’t see without having to attempt a
      Perception check, but such creatures still have total concealment from the
      eidolon.</p>

      <p>Visibility still affects the eidolon’s movement, and it is still denied
      its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it
      cannot see.</p>
