  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>possession</i>, except you possess an object
      instead of a creature.  A possessed object becomes capable of animation,
      gaining the statistics of an animated object of its size (including 1 CP
      worth of abilities; <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 14). You can't use any
      spells or other abilities while possessing an object.  A spiritual tether
      connects your body to the possessed object, in a manner similar to a
      silver cord (see page 244). If the possessed object and your body are ever
      farther than close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) from one another, this
      tether breaks, returning your consciousness to your body.</p>
