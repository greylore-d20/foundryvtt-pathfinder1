      "value": "<p>Cavaliers of the order of the blossom dedicate their lives to protecting fey, especially those visiting the Material Plane from the First World. These cavaliers might be fey themselves, but even if they aren’t, they exhibit the same whimsy and occasionally cruel sense of humor typical of most denizens of the First World.<br><br><strong>Edicts:</strong> The cavalier cannot refuse a fey’s request for aid unless it will interfere with his existing duties, or he believes the fey seeks to directly oppose his other aims and goals. He must strive to prevent gates to the First World from being exploited or corrupted. If the cavalier encounters&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Blighted%20Fey%20(Satyr)\">blighted fey</a>&nbsp;or other corrupted fey, he must strive to destroy them.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the blossom cavalier issues a challenge, the target of the challenge takes a –1 penalty on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities used by fey or by the cavalier. This penalty increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has. An order of the blossom cavalier can’t issue a challenge against any creature of the fey type unless that creature has the blighted fey template.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the blossom cavalier adds Disguise and Knowledge (nature) to his list of class skills. An order of the blossom cavalier can attempt Knowledge (nature) skill checks untrained. Whenever an order of the blossom cavalier attempts a Bluff check to feint in combat, he receives a bonus on the check equal to half his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>"
