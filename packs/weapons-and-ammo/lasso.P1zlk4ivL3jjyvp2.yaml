  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This thrown weapon is a length of rope with a simple open knot on one
      end that allows you entangle a foe like you would using a net. The DC to
      cast a spell while entangled with a lasso is 10 + the spell level being
      cast. An entangled creature can slip free with a successful DC 15 Escape
      Artist check as a full-round action. The lasso has 2 hit points and AC 10,
      and requires a DC 23 Strength check to break it. On a successful hit, the
      lasso tightens; to use it again you must spend a standard action sliding
      the knot to enlarge the loop.</p>
