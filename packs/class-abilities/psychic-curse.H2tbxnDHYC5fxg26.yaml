    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to curse a
      living creature within 30 feet with your psychic magic. You can choose one
      of the following effects: memory lapse, mental block, or pain
      confusion.</p>

      <p>If you choose memory lapse, the target loses its memory of the past 1
      hour per occultist level you possess.</p>

      <p>If you choose mental block, you can proscribe one specific action, such
      as attacking with a type of weapon, casting a specific spell, or something
      else suitably specific (subject to the GM’s discretion). The target can’t
      take that action without first succeeding at a Will save. If it fails, it
      can take other actions instead. If it attempts the prohibited action again
      on subsequent rounds, it gains a cumulative +2 bonus on the save until it
      succeeds.</p>

      <p>If you select pain confusion, the creature is confused for 1d4 rounds
      whenever it is damaged by a critical hit. The target can attempt a Will
      save to negate this effect. This effect lasts for 1 day per occultist
      level you possess.</p>

      <p>A creature can’t be under the effects of more than one psychic curse at
      a time. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
