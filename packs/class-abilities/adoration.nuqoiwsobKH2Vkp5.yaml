  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As an immediate action, you can attempt to thwart a melee or ranged
      attack that targets you. This ability functions as sanctuary, but only
      against one individual attack. You must use the ability after the attack
      is declared but before the roll is made. The creature attacking you
      receives a Will save to negate this effect. If a creature has more than
      one attack, this ability only affects one of the attacks. You can use the
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. This
      is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Dazing Touch power of the Charm Domain.</p>
