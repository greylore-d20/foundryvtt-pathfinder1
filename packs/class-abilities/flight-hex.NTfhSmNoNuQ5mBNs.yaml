  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch grows lighter as she gains power, eventually gaining the
      ability to fly.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, the witch can use feather fall at will and gains a +4
      racial bonus on Swim checks.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, she can cast levitate once per day.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, she can fly, as per the spell, for a number of minutes
      per day equal to her level.</p>

      <p>These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in
      1-minute increments. This hex only affects the witch.</p>
