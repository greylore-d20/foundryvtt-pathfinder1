A packet of insomnia powder can be thrown as a <em>splash weapon</em> with a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at a DC 12 <em>Fortitude</em> save to avoid the effect, while those in the splash radius must succeed at DC 8 <em>Fortitude</em> saves. This is a <em>poison</em> effect.</p>\r\n<p>Although it causes no severe damage, insomnia can cause a creature to be more <em>prone</em> to <em>fatigue</em> or <em>exhaustion</em>. Though it prevents sleep (and thus prevents <em>wizards</em> and some other spellcasters from regaining their spells), insomnia powder does not prevent a creature from meditating or praying. The effects of insomnia powder can be countered by <em>sleep</em>, <em>neutralize poison</em>, or similar effects.</p>\r\n"
