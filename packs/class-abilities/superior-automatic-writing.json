      "value": "<p>At 5th level, when attempting checks for the automatic writing occult skill unlock, you can treat your psychic level + your Wisdom bonus as your number of Linguistics skill ranks.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain an additional option when using automatic writing, and can attempt a DC 35 check to gain information as though you’d used commune instead of augury or divination.</p>\n<p>This type of commune requires no material component, and the duration equals 1 round per psychic class level you possess. You connect to a distant being of great intellect, a fragment of the Akashic Record, or a similar bastion of knowledge instead of to a deity.</p>"
