    value: >-
      <p>You disrupt the conjuring energies within a summoned creature, causing
      it to violently explode. If the target fails its Fortitude save, it is
      immediately slain and all creatures within 20 feet of the target take 1d4
      points of damage per spell level of the  summoning spell that conjured the
      target. This damage is fire damage unless the target creature has the cold
      or water subtype, in which case it's cold damage. Creatures caught in this
      explosion take half damage if they succeed at their Reflex saves against
      this spell's DC. <i>Final sacrifice</i> can detonate a summoner's eidolon,
      though an eidolon receives a +4 bonus on its Fortitude save unless the
      spell is cast by the eidolon's own summoner. If this spell targets an
      eidolon, creatures within 20 feet of the eidolon take an amount of damage
      equal to 1d4 + 1/2 the caster level of the summoner who controlled the
      eidolon.</p>
