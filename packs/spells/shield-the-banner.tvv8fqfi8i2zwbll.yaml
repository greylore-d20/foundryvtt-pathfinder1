      <p>This spell is used to protect one of a tribe's most valuable
      possessions: its tribal banner. Any creature (other than a member of the
      tribe which the standard represents) attempting to directly attack or
      touch the standard must make a Will save. This spell functions as
      sanctuary, but only protects a standard or banner. In addition, the spell
      grants a +2 bonus to the standard's hardness, and +10 to the standard's
      hit points for the duration of the spell.</p>
