      <p>When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that
      deals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
      +5).</p><p>Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures
      such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.</p>
