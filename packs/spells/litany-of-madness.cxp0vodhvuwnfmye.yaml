      <p>This litany is a sermon of madness. The target is confused. At the
      start of each of its turns, it can make a Will saving throw against the
      confused effect (DC of the spell). If the target fails the save, it
      continues to be confused. If it makes the save, the effect ends.  While
      subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell
      that has the word "litany" in the title.</p>
