      <p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to <em>change shape</em> (as the
      spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.kouqz0pm1xl8xilm]{Alter Self}) for a number
      of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level. These rounds need not be
      consecutive. At 17th level, the duration of this effect is no longer
      limited, and you may remain in your chosen form as long as you want.</p>
