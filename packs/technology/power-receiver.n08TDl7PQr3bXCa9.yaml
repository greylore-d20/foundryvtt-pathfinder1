      <p>A power receiver is a device that attaches to any technological item's
      battery slot. The power receiver is then set to the same frequency as a
      nearby power generator capable of broadcasting power, after which the
      device draws power from the generator as if it were attached via a power
      cable. The generator determines the range at which the device can draw
      power; this signal can be enhanced by a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.technology.PwlXM1Qw4bX1JfRC]{Signal booster} or
      blocked by a @UUID[Compendium.pf1.technology.uZf4VqssxJFH6Yov]{Signal
      jammer}.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 30;
