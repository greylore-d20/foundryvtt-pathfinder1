The subject receives flashes of her entire life up to this point. She can use the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier on the check, and she can attempt the check untrained. The subject cannot learn information that she has not previously read, heard, or otherwise experienced at some point during her life when using this ability.</p>"
