These attacks can be any combination of unarmed strikes and attacks with a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>&nbsp;special weapon (he does not need to use two weapons to utilize this ability).</p>\n<p>For the purpose of these attacks, the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;from his monk class levels is equal to his monk level.
