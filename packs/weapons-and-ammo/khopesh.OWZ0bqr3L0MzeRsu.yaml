  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This heavy blade has a convex curve near the end, making its overall
      shape similar to that of a battleaxe. A typical khopesh is 20 to 24 inches
      in length. Its curved shape allows the wielder to hook around defenses and
      trip foes. The elegant shape of a khopesh leads some artisans to cover
      them in ornate decorations.</p>
