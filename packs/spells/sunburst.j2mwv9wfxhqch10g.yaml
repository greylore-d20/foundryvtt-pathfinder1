      <p><i>Sunburst</i> causes a globe of searing radiance to explode silently
      from a point you select. All creatures in the globe are blinded and take
      6d6 points of damage. A creature to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural
      takes double damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and
      reduces the damage by half.</p><p>An undead creature caught within the
      globe takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), or half
      damage if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the burst results in
      the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light
      if it fails its save.</p><p>The ultraviolet light generated by the spell
      deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead
      creatures.</p><p><i>Sunburst</i> dispels any darkness spells of lower than
      9th level within its area.</p>
