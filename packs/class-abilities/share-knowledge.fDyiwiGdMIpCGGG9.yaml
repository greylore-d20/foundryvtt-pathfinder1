    value: >-
      <p>The shaman targets a single willing ally within 30 feet and shares her
      knowledge and experience with that target for a number of minutes equal to
      her Charisma modifier. During that time, the subject knows the languages
      that the shaman does and uses the shamanâ€™s skill modifier on all Knowledge
      checks instead of its own.</p>

      <p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24
      hours.</p>
