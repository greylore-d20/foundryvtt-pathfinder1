  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>hold monster</i>, except that the target
      is constricted as if by the coils of a large snake, taking 1d6+6 points of
      bludgeoning damage each round that it fails its save. A successful save
      ends both the paralyzing and constriction effects.</p>
