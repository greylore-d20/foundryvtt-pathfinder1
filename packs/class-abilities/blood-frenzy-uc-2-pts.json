It gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls and attacks the nearest creature each round, friend or foe, although it ceases attacking its summoner after hitting once. The frenzy lasts for 5 rounds or until the eidolon can perceive no creatures. At the end of that time, the eidolon is fatigued for 1 minute. It cannot enter a blood frenzy while fatigued.&nbsp;</p>"
