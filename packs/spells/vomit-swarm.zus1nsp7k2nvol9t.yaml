  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You vomit forth a swarm of spiders (<i>Bestiary</i>, page 258) that
      attacks all other creatures within its area. The swarm begins adjacent to
      you, but if no living creatures are within its area, it moves in one
      direction of your choosing at its normal speed.</p><p>You can move the
      swarm or change the swarm's direction by spending a standard action to
      concentrate on the swarm, otherwise it continues moving in its current
      direction. If your caster level is at least 7th, you can vomit forth a
      swarm of wasps instead (<i>Bestiary</i> 275). Finally, if your caster
      level is at least 13th, you can vomit forth a swarm of army ants
      (<i>Bestiary</i> 16).</p>
