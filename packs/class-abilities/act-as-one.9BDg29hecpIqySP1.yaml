  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, the cavalier can spend a standard action to move up to
      his speed and make a melee attack. All allies within 30 feet can also move
      up to their speed and make a melee attack as an immediate action. This
      movement and attack can be made as a charge if the movement qualifies. All
      attacks are made at a +2 bonus (this stacks with the bonus from a charge)
      and all participants receive a +2 dodge bonus to their AC for 1 round. A
      cavalier can use this ability once per combat.</p>
