      <p>The vigilante is so well known that his name precedes him, even to
      other communities. It only takes 4 hours of effort to get the word out to
      transfer his renown benefits to a new community.</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 13th level and have both the incredible
      renown and triumphant return social talents to select this talent.</p>
