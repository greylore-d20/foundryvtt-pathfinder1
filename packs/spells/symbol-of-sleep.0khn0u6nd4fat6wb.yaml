      <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that all
      creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the <i>symbol of sleep</i>
      instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 x 10 minutes. Unlike with
      the <i>sleep</i> spell, <i>sleep</i>ing creatures cannot be awakened by
      nonmagical means before this time expires.</p><p>Unlike <i>symbol of
      death</i>, <i>symbol of sleep</i> has no hit point limit; once triggered,
      a <i><i>symbol of sleep</i></i> simply remains active for 10 minutes per
      caster level.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol of
      sleep</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the
      Perception skill to find a <i>symbol of sleep</i> and Disable Device to
      thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for <i>symbol of
      sleep</i>.</p>
