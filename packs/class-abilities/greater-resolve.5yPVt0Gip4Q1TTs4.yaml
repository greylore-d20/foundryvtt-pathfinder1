  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, a samurai can spend his resolve to negate some of his
      most grievous wounds. After a critical hit is confirmed against him, the
      samurai can spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to treat
      that critical hit as a normal hit. Effects that only trigger on a critical
      hit do not trigger when the samurai uses this ability.</p>
