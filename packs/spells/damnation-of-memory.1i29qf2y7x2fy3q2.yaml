  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You name one creature and excise all memory of that creature's
    involvement in events the targets remember. The targets either forget who
    exactly performed the named creature's deeds or assume some other individual
    performed them. Alternatively, you can name either one event lasting no more
    than 10 minutes per caster level or a single topic (defined at the GM's
    discretion) such as a shameful secret of the king that was recently revealed
    or a small revolt that was quelled messily, and erase all recollection of
    that subject from the minds of all creatures within the area. Memory of
    facts and topics that are common knowledge (information with a Knowledge
    check DC of 10 or less) cannot be stolen via this spell.  The lost memories
    are stored in the focus gem (which grows dull inside and cannot be used as a
    focus or material component for any other spell, including another casting
    of this spell). The targets emanate no magic and the spell cannot be
    dispelled from them; only the focus retains a magic aura, and only by
    targeting the gem can the spell be dispelled, disjoined, or suppressed with
    antimagic. If the gem is destroyed or the spell is dispelled (which destroys
    the gem), all stolen memories return to the affected creatures.</p>
