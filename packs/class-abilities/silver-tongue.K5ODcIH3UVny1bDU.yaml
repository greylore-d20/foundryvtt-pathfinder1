  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can draw upon your <em>outsider</em> heritage to spin
      amazingly convincing lies. Activating this ability is a <em>swift
      action</em>. You gain a +5 bonus on one <em>Bluff</em> check made to
      convince another of the truth of your words (similar to using
      <em>glibness</em>). If a magical effect is used against you that would
      detect your lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect
      must succeed on a <em>caster level</em> check (DC 10 + your sorcerer
      level) to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or
      force you to speak only the truth. You can use this ability a number of
      times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier.</p>
