  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to take a –2 penalty to AC
      and CMD for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s level. A successful
      Will saving throw reduces this to just 1 round.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the penalty becomes –4.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, a creature affected by a
      hampering hex cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
