  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of banishment for a number of
      rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Any summoned or called creature
      in the area must make a <em>Will</em> save each round. Once the creature
      fails a <em>Will</em> <em>saving throw</em>, it is <em>staggered</em> as
      long as it remains inside the aura. If it fails a second <em>Will</em>
      <em>saving throw</em>, it is immediately sent back to its home plane and
      the spell that summoned it immediately ends. If that spell summoned more
      than one creature, only the creature that failed its <em>saving
      throws</em> is affected. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
