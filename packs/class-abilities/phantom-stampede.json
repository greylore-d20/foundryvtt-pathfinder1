      "value": "<p>The shaman summons a host of ghostly herd beasts to trample a single creature. These phantom beasts affect only the target creature, which is buffeted and pummeled by their passing. The creature takes no damage from the ability, but takes a –4 penalty to its CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts. Additionally, spellcasters under the effect of this ability take a –4 penalty on concentration checks. The target receives no saving throw to negate this effect.</p>\n<p>This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s level.</p>\n<p>The creature can’t be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>"
