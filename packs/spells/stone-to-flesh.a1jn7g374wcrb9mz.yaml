      <p>This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring
      life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive
      the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.
      The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such
      flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or
      magical energy is available. For example, this spell would turn an
      animated stone statue into an animated flesh statue, but an ordinary
      statue would become a mass of inert flesh in the shape of the statue. You
      can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in
      diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in
      a larger mass of stone.</p>
