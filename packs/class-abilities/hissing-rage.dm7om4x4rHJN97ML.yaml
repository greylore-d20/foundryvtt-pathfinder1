    value: >-
      <p>Once per hour, the barbarian can spit venom at an adjacent enemy as a
      standard action. She must make a touch attack to successfully spit on a
      foe in this way, but she can also apply this poison as a swift action when
      she hits with a bite attack. The DC of the save against this poison is
      equal to 10 + half the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution
      modifier.</p><p><strong>Hissing Rage Poison (Su)</strong> Bite—contact or
      injury; save Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage;
      cure 2 consecutive saves.</p>
