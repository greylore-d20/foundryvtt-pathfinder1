  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, as a standard action you can touch an ally to allow her
      to ignore the effects of gravity for 1 minute (as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.7d6sv5ecvi7kho3m]{Fly}y). The ally gains a fly
      speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability. The ally is also immune to
      dangerous environmental conditions (as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.f6lqt3ju8m7r5la2]{Life Bubble}) for 1 minute.</p>
