      <p><b>Element</b> universal; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 5;
      <b>Burn</b> 1</p>

      <p>You are able to suspend your body in a large mass of elemental matter.
      Until the next time your burn is removed, you can change your size to
      Large or shift back to your original size as a standard action. This
      doesnâ€™t change your ability scores in any way.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, you can accept 1 additional point of burn to instead
      change your size to Huge. You cannot use kinetic form to decrease your
      size.</p>
