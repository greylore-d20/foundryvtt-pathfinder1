  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell blesses a corpse with positive energy, preventing it from
      being turned into an undead creature. Attempts to raise the corpse as an
      undead automatically fail. If the corpse is of a person slain by a
      creature that creates undead out of its slain foes (such as a shadow,
      vampire, or wraith), that is delayed until the end of this spell. It is
      possible to protect a corpse for an extended time by casting this spell
      each day.</p><p><i>Sanctify corpse</i> can be made permanent with a
      <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 9th level or higher for the cost of
      500 gp.</p>
