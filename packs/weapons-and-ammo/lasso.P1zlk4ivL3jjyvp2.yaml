      Thrown</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This thrown weapon is a length of rope
      with a simple open knot on one end that allows you entangle a foe like you
      would using a net. The DC to cast a spell while entangled with a lasso is
      10 + the spell level being cast. An entangled creature can slip free with
      a successful DC 15 Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The lasso
      has 2 hit points and AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to break
      it. On a successful hit, the lasso tightens; to use it again you must
      spend a standard action sliding the knot to enlarge the loop.</p>
