    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can make a single
      firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the
      following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a
      creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot
      be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part
      of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks
      are immune to these effects.</p><ul><li><p>Arms: On a hit, the target
      takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the
      gunslinger’s choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items
      held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.</p></li><li><p>Head:
      On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1
      round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p></li><li><p>Legs: On a hit, the
      target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or
      more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this
