Make a bull rush combat maneuver check with a –4 penalty against the secondary target. If this check succeeds, the thrown creature lands prone in the secondary target’s square, while the secondary target is pushed back and knocked prone in an adjacent square. If the check fails, the thrown creature lands prone in the nearest square you threaten adjacent to the secondary target.</p><p>If you throw a Large or larger creature into an area containing multiple secondary targets, you take an additional penalty of –4 on your combat maneuver check for each target after the first.</p><p><b>Special</b>: A monk may take this as a bonus feat at 14th level.</p><h2>Combat Trick</h2><p>When using this feat to throw a target into another creature’s space, you can spend up to 6 stamina points to reduce the penalty on the bull rush attempt against the secondary target by an amount equal to the number of stamina points you spent.</p>"
