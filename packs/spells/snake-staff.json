You can only apply this spell to wooden objects not in a creature's possession or not part of a larger structure or plant. Each time you cast this spell you can create a number of snakes equal to your caster level. More powerful snakes take up more than one of your available total, as noted below.</p><p> Venomous Snake: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 1 snake.</p><p> Constrictor Snake: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 2 snakes.</p><p> Advanced Venomous Snake: A stick or piece of firewood. Counts as 2 snakes.</p><p> Advanced Constrictor Snake: A staff or tree branch. Counts as 3 snakes.</p><p> Advanced Giant Venomous Snake: A log or pile of debris.
