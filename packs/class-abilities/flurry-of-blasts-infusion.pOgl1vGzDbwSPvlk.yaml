      <p><b>Element</b> universal; <b>Type</b> form infusion; <b>Level</b> 3;
      <b>Burn</b> 2<br><b>Prerequisite</b> extended range<br><b>Associated
      Blasts</b> any<br><b>Saving Throw</b> none</p>

      <p>Instead of a single kinetic blast, you shoot two kinetic blasts at
      targets within 120 feet that each deal damage as if your kineticist level
      were 1st (effects or abilities that increase your kinetic blast’s damage
      don’t apply). At 10th level, you can shoot three blasts with flurry of
      blasts; this increases to four blasts at 16th level and to five blasts at
      20th level. If you are under the effect of haste or similar magic that
      increases your number of attacks in a fullattack action, the number of
      kinetic blasts in your flurry of blasts increases by 1.<p>No two targets
      can be more than 30 feet apart. You must assign the targets of all your
      blasts before rolling any of the attacks. Any blast beyond the first that
      hits the same target adds 1d6 points of damage; bonuses and penalties to
      damage don’t apply. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a
      saving throw, a target attempts its save only once (even if it was hit
      multiple times), but it takes a penalty on the save equal to the number of
      times it was hit beyond the first. If you are using a substance infusion
      that requires a caster level check or combat maneuver check, you roll the
      check only once against each target, but you gain a bonus on the check
      equal to the number of times that target was hit beyond the first. If you
      are using the pushing substance infusion, the maximum distance of the push
      increases by 5 feet for each time the target was hit beyond the first.</p>
