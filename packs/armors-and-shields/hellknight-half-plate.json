      "value": "<p>The armor worn by a Hellknight signifer is a vestment of armored plates, chain, and dark fabric. It functions as half-plate, but it can be donned and removed as though it were medium armor. Any spellcaster who wears this armor is treated as if he were wearing Hellknight plate for the purposes of any feats and effects that require one to be wearing Hellknight plate. This armor includes a signifer mask, though signifer masks can be purchased separately.</p>"
