  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Though they are technically sling ammunition, these thread- or
      cloth-wrapped pebbles are mainly used for signaling or celebration rather
      than battle, as they barely hit hard enough to sting. When soaked in oil
      or strong alcohol, they burn brightly for 1 round, illuminating an area
      like a candle and creating brief streaks of light as they fly through the
      air. They generally aren't hot enough and burn out too quickly to ignite
      combustibles.</p>
