    value: >-
      <p>This spell was created by the paladins of the Mendevian Crusades, and
      co-opted by inquisitors and rangers dedicated to tracking and fighting
      demons, devils, and other evil extraplanar creatures.</p><p>When you cast
      this spell on a melee weapon you imbue it with a powerful <i>holy</i>
      energy, granting the weapon the <i>bane</i> weapon quality against evil
      outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit
      against an outsider with the evil subtype, you not only deal normal
      critical damage with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3
      rounds-the outsider can reduce this nauseated condition to sickened for 1
      round with a successful Fortitude save.</p>
