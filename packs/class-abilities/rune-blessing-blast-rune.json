      "value": "<p>At 1st level, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent square. Any creature entering this square takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 your warpriest level. This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, designated when you create the rune. The rune is invisible, and lasts a number of rounds equal to your warpriest level or until discharged. You cannot create a blast rune in a square occupied by another creature.</p>\n<p>This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purposes of dispelling. It can be discovered with a successful DC 26 Perception skill check and disarmed with a successful DC 26 Disable Device skill check.</p>"
