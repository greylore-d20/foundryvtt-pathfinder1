  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Choose one alignment type: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You gain the
      ability to follow the trail of a strong or overwhelming aura of that
      alignment (see <i>detect evil</i>, <i>Core Rulebook</i> 266). This is
      treated as tracking using the scent special quality, except you are
      following the traces of their aura upon the ground rather than their
      scent, and you receive no bonus on Perception checks. At 10th level, you
      can track the trail of creatures with a moderate alignment aura as
      well.</p><p>When you use this spell to track a given alignment, it gains
      the descriptor of the opposite alignment. For example, when <i>follow
      aura</i> is used to track evil, it gains the good descriptor.</p>
