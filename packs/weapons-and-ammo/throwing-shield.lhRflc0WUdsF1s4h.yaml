    value: >-
      <p>This shield is designed for throwing and has specially designed straps
      that allow you to unclasp and throw it as a free action. Tower shields
      cannot be throwing shields. Neither a shield's enhancement bonus to AC nor
      its shield spikes apply on your attack or damage rolls. A throwing shield
      can't be disarmed.</p>
