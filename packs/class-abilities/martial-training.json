She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.GsjouI6B8X7BA5wN]{Stunning Fist} and a monk’s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely @Compendium[pf1.feats.GsjouI6B8X7BA5wN]{Stunning Fist}.&lt;/magic.wondrous%monk's&gt;</p>"
