  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you are one with the storm. You gain <em>immunity</em>
      to <em>deafness</em>, <em>stunning</em>, and wind effects and gain
      <em>blindsight</em> 120 feet against <em>concealment</em> from natural or
      magical fog, mist, or weather. Once per day, when attacked with an
      electricity or sonic effect, you may forgo your <em>saving throw</em> and
      absorb the energies of the attack, healing 1 point of damage for every 3
      points of damage the attack would otherwise have dealt.</p>
