      <p>Fighting in the mountains of Zi Ha has trained samsaran slayers to
      strike the unwary with deadly attacks from above. If a slayer deals sneak
      attack damage to a creature that is unaware of his presence while he is
      standing on higher ground than his target, he does not have to roll sneak
      attack damage; instead, the sneak attack deals maximum damage. The
      samsaran must be standing on solid ground to use this ability.</p>
