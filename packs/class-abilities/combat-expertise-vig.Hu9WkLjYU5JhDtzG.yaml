  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.NFxHebU1XhEs5WJh]{Combat
      Expertise} as a bonus feat, even if he doesn’t meet the prerequisites. If
      he already has Combat Expertise, he instead gains another feat he
      qualified for at the level when he chose Combat Expertise. If the
      vigilante’s Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the
      purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p>
