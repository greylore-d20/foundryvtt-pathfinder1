      <p>The target object is enhanced to function as a masterwork item. In
      addition to any bonuses for the masterwork quality, the object gains other
      bonuses. Skill kits and other equipment add an additional +1 insight bonus
      for every 4 caster levels you possess to skill checks made with them that
      already receive a bonus from the skill kit. Armor and weapons gain
      temporary hit points equal to your caster level. If the object already has
      an enhancement bonus, this bonus increases by 1. If the object of the
      spell has hardness, that hardness increases by 5.</p>
