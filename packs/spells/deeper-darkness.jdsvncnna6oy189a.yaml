  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as
    @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.tsndfcfijmgxs37p]{darkness}, except that objects
    radiate <em>darkness</em> in a 60-foot radius and the light level is lowered
    by two steps. Bright light becomes dim light and normal light becomes
    <em>darkness</em>. Areas of dim light and <em>darkness</em> become
    supernaturally dark. This functions like <em>darkness</em>, but even
    creatures with darkvision cannot see within the spell's confines.</p><p>This
    spell does not stack with itself. <em>Deeper darkness</em> can be used to
    counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.</p>
