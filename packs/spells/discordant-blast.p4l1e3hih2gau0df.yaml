    value: >-
      <p>You create a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot-radius
      burst centered on you or in 30-foot cone-shaped burst.</p><p>Creatures in
      the area take 3d6 points of sonic damage and are pushed away as if bull
      rushed. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each
      creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster
      level plus your Charisma modifier. This bull rush does not provoke an
      attack of opportunity. A <i>discordant blast</i> cannot penetrate a
      <i>silence</i> spell (or any similar magical <i>silence</i> effect).</p>
