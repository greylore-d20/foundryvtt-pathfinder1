      <p>A roiling blast of rough rock and dirt scatters along the ground in the
      area, dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage per 2 caster levels (maximum
      5d6) to all creatures on the ground in the area, even on a successful
      saving throw. Creatures in the area that fail the Reflex save fall prone
      and are knocked to the nearest edge of the area, taking 1d6 points of
      bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they travel this way. Creatures that
      did not move during the past round and those with the stability racial
      trait gain a +4 bonus on the saving throw.</p>
