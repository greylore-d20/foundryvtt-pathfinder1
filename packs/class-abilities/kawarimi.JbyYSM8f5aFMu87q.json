The ninja can attempt this check while being observed as long as she has cover or concealment (or an ability that allows her to attempt Stealth checks without cover or concealment). If she’s successful, the opponent’s attack hits an inanimate object that the attacker mistook for the ninja, and the ninja may move into an adjacent square and is hidden from the attacker.</p>"
