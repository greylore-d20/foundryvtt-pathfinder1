      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 21</p><p>At 8th level, you can fling a ball of hardened mud at a foe within 30 feet as a standard action. If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, the mud slams into the targetâ€™s face, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 wizard levels you have and blinding the target for 1d4 rounds. A creature can remove the blinding mud from itself or another creature with a successful Strength check (DC = 10 + half your wizard level) as a standard action. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half your wizard level.</p>"
