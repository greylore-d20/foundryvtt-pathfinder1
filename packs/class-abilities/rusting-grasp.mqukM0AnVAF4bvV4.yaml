        <p>Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the item
        is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-footradius
        volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal
        are immune to this spell.</p><p>You may employ <em>rusting grasp</em> in
        combat with a successful melee touch attack. <em>Rusting grasp</em> used
        in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of AC gained from metal
        armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offers) through
        corrosion.</p><p>Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are
        more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack
        against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Striking at
        an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must
        touch the weapon and not the other way around.</p><p>Against a ferrous
        creature, <em>rusting grasp</em> instantaneously deals 3d6 points of
        damage + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The
        spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch
        attack per round.</p>
