  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent/trick gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all
      Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon. Furthermore, if she makes
      a sneak attack during the surprise round using a concealed weapon that her
      opponent didnâ€™t know about, she does not have to roll sneak attack damage,
      and the sneak attack deals maximum damage. A character can only use the
      underhanded talent a number of times per day equal to her Charisma
      modifier (minimum 0).</p>
