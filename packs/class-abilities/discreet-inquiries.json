While the vigilante is in his area of renown, gathering information in this way takes 2d4 hours and costs 2d4 gp. Anyone who might take notice of the information gathering does not notice unless she succeeds at a Sense Motive check opposed by the vigilanteâ€™s Bluff check.</p>\n<p>The vigilante gains a +4 bonus on this Bluff check.</p>"
