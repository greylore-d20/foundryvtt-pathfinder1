  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb,
      the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his
      body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This
      breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each
      creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit
      from the alchemist’s bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2
      the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligent modifier) halves the
      damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling
      breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
