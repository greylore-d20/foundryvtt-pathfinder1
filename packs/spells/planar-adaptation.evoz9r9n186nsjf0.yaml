      <p><i>Planar adaptation</i> grants you immunity to the harmful
      environmental effects of a particular plane of existence, including such
      hazards as toxicity, extreme temperatures, and lack of air. Additionally,
      you gain energy resistance 20 to a single energy type prevalent on that
      plane (choose one if more than one type is equally prevalent). <i>Planar
      adaptation</i> has no when cast upon your native plane.</p>
