  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You mask your features with shadowy illumination, gaining a competence
      bonus equal to your caster level on Disguise checks and Stealth checks
      attempted while in normal light, dim light, or darkness. In addition,
      creatures that see you while you are in dim light or darkness are unable
      to discern any but the most general information about your appearance or
      actions. For example, they can determine your general shape (such as
      humanoid), as well as the gist of your actions (such as, "She was trying
      to break into the store"), but cannot determine your precise actions, your
      appearance, or any identifying information about you. In bright light,
      your normal appearance is revealed.</p>
