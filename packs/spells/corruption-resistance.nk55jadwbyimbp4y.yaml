  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You grant the touched creature limited protection from magical effects
    that inflict damage based on the target creature's alignment, such as
    <i>holy smite</i>, order's wrath, a paladin's smite evil attack, or an
    <i>unholy</i> weapon. Choose one alignment type: chaos, evil, good, or law.
    The subject takes 5 less points of damage from effects that specifically
    harm creatures of that alignment. The value of the protection increases to
    10 points at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell protects the
    recipient's equipment as well.</p><p><i>Corruption resistance</i> protects
    against spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities, not physical
    attacks. <i>Corruption resistance</i> only protects against damage. The
    subject can still suffer side effects from such attacks. When you use this
    spell to protect an alignment, it gains the descriptor of that
    alignment.</p>
