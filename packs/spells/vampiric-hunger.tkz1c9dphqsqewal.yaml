      <p>The target of this spell grows the fangs of a vampire, as well as a
      thirst for blood. For the duration of this spell, the target gains the
      ability to drain an opponent's blood during a grapple; if the target
      establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage. Each round it drains blood in this way, the target
      heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for the duration of the
      spell (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full
      normal hit points). If the target does not drain blood in this way while
      under the effects of this spell, it becomes exhausted at the end of the
      spell's duration.</p>
