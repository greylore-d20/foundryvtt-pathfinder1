    value: >-
      <p>The rogue can select a vigilante talent. For the purposes of selecting
      and using this talent, she counts as a 10th-level vigilante with the
      stalker specialization, regardless of her actual rogue level. Her sneak
      attack counts as a hidden strike with reduced damage for the purpose of
      determining the effects of her vigilante talent, which means, among other
      things, that she canâ€™t apply any of the vigilante talents marked with an
      asterisk (*) to her sneak attacks.</p>
