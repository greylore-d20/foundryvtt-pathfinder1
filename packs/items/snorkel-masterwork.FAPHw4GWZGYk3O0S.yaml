      <p>This @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.CpdzRs10h7wTjG4A]{snorkel} has a
      valve at the top to keep out of the water, keeping it from being flooded
      from splashes or when you submerge. It also has a sump and valve near your
      mouth, preventing water from reaching your mouth and automatically
      draining excess water when you surface.</p>
