  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Banded mail is made up of overlapping strips of metal, fastened to a
      sturdy backing of leather and chain. The size of the metal plates,
      interconnected metal bands, and layers of underlying armor make it a more
      significant defense than similar armors, like scale mail or splint
      mail.</p>
