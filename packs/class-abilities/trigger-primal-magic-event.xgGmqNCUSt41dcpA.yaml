    value: >-
      <p>Once per day as an immediate action, you can cause a spellcaster
      (including yourself ) within 30 feet to trigger a primal magic event as
      the spell is being cast.</p>

      <p>At 13th level, you can cause any creature in the act of activating a
      magic item to trigger a primal magic event (see page 13).</p>

      <p>At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. A spellcaster
      can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spellâ€™s level) to
      focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect, but
      non-spellcasters activating magic items have no such option.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 9th level before selecting this revelation.</p>
