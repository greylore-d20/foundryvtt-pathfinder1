A skeleton key may be tried on any standard door lock that uses a key, even if you don't have the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a> skill. You use the key's <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a> bonus of +10 rather than your own total; you cannot take 10 when using a skeleton key. The key only gets one roll for any particular lock. If the roll fails, the key is unable to open or close that lock. Inferior skeleton keys may only have a +5 bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n"
