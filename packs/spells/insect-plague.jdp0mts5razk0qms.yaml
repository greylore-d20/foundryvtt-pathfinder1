  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a number of swarms of wasps (one per three levels, to a
      maximum of six swarms at 18th level, see the <i>Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary</i>). The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to
      at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous
      area). You may summon the wasp swarms so that they share the area of other
      creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms
      are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures that
      flee.</p>
