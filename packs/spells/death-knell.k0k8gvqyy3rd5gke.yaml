    value: >-
      <p>You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to fuel
      your own power. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living creature that
      has -1 or fewer hit points. If the subject fails its saving throw, it
      dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to
      Strength. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1,
      improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in
      effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells. These
      effects last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature.</p>
