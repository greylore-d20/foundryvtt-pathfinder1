  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to disrupt
      the mind of one living creature within 30 feet. The creature can attempt a
      Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it fails the save, the creature
      can’t concentrate on any spell effects and must succeed at a concentration
      check to cast any spell (DC = 15 + double the spell level). The affected
      creature takes a –4 penalty on this check if the spell includes a thought
      component. The creature takes a –2 penalty on all Will saving throws while
      under this effect.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess.</p>
