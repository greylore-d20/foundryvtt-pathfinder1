      <p><b>Element</b> air, fire, void, water; <b>Type</b> form infusion;
      <b>Level</b> 1; <b>Burn</b> 1<br><b>Associated Blasts</b> blue flame,
      cold, electric, fire, negative<br><b>Saving Throw</b> none</p>

      <p>Choose a manufactured weapon in your hand (not an unarmed strike or
      natural attack); if the weapon is a double weapon, you must choose one of
      its ends to receive this benefit. You imbue the chosen weapon with your
      elemental energy as part of an attack action, charge action, or
      full-attack action to add extra damage to each of your attacks with that
      weapon until the beginning of your next turn. Your attacks with the chosen
      weapon during that action deal 1d6 additional points of damage.</p>

      <p>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus damage increases
      by 1d6 points.</p>

      <p>Blue flame blasts deal double this additional damage. The additional
      damage is of the same type as the infused blast’s damage. This additional
      damage ignores spell resistance and doesn’t apply any modifiers to your
      kinetic blast’s damage (such as your Constitution modifier).</p>
