      <p>You grant the targeted weapon one of the following weapon special
      abilities: <i>anarchic</i>, <i>axiomatic</i>, <i>holy</i>, or
      un<i>holy</i>. If <i>anarchic</i>, this spell has the chaos descriptor; if
      <i>axiomatic</i>, the law descriptor; if <i>holy</i>, the good descriptor;
      and if un<i>holy</i>, the evil descriptor. If the caster attempts to place
      a special ability on a weapon that already has that special ability, the
      spell fails.  If a warpriest casts this spell on his sacred weapon, the
      duration doubles. Warpriests with unarmed strike as a sacred weapon can
      cast this spell on their unarmed strike.</p>
