If you hit a target with a bolas bolt fired from a slaver's crossbow, attempt a trip combat maneuver against your target (don't add your Strength bonus when attempting the combat maneuver check). You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas bolt.</p><p></p><p> On a critical hit, instead of dealing extra damage, the bolas bolt ensnares its target. Your target is entangled until it or an ally succeeds at a DC 15 Strength check to break the bolas cords. A light slaver's crossbow can entangle a target up to the same size as its intended wielder, and a heavy slaver's crossbow can entangle a creature up to one size larger. A masterwork bolas bolt or one with an enhancement bonus of at least +1 increases the DC of the Strength check to break the bolas to 20.</p><p></p><p> If the attack trips and entangles a target, the creature cannot move from its square until it breaks free of the bolas cords.</p>"
