      <p>With a burst of telekinetic force, you deal 1d6 points of force damage
      per caster level (maximum 15d6 points of damage) to all other creatures in
      the affected area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage taken by
      half. A creature that fails its Fortitude save must also succeed at a
      Reflex save or be knocked prone.</p>
