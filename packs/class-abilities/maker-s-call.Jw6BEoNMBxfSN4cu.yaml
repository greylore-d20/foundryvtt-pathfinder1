  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to
      his side. This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{dimension door}, using the
      summonerâ€™s caster level. When used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the
      summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If
      the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use
      this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day
      for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
