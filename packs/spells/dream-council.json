    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions as <i>dream</i>, but you and the target of your <i>dream</i> can converse in a limited fashion as long as the recipient is also asleep. You can send or receive a number of <i>dream</i> messages equal to your caster level. Each message can be up to 25 words long or a single vague image that can't convey fine details such as words. You can send and receive these <i>dream</i> messages with a single target or multiple targets, but each message you send or receive counts against the total number of messages allowed. Sending a message takes 1 round. The spell ends and you wake up when you run out of messages.  If you use <i>dream</i> council to send a message to a sleeping creature that has <i>dream</i> or <i>dream</i> council prepared (or is able to cast it spontaneously or as a spell-like ability), the recipient can expend one of your allotted messages to cast that spell while remaining asleep. This uses up that creature's prepared spell, spell per day, or spell-like ability use as normal. Instead of replying to your message, that character is able to enter your <i>dream</i>scape. If the sleeping recipient has the Lucid Dreamer feat, it can enter your <i>dream</i>scape without casting either of those spells. While in the original caster's <i>dream</i>scape, those involved in the council can interact with one another and that <i>dream</i>scape for 10 minutes for each message remaining. When that time elapses, the spell ends.</p>",
