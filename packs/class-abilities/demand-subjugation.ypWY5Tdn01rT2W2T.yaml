    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can force a defeated creature to accept a binding
      pact as a condition of its surrender, as if you are using lesser geas,
      except the creature must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than
      your cleric level. At 16th level, this ability functions as per
      geas/quest. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3
      + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Staff of Order power of the Law Domain.</p>
