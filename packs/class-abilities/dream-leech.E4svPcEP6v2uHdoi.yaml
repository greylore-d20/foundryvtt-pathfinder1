      <p>While adjacent to a sleeping or unconscious creature, you can take a
      swift action to siphon that creature’s dreams, thereby learning new things
      about your own mind. The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this
      effect; such creatures are never considered willing. Creatures that don’t
      dream are immune to this effect. If the subject fails the save, you gain a
      +4 bonus on your next Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against the
      subject within the next 24 hours, and you regain 1 point in your phrenic
      pool.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your
      Charisma modifier, but no more than once per hour and no more than once
      per creature per day.</p>
