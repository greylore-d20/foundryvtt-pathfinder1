  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The subject temporarily ceases to feel the ill effects of a single
    ongoing affliction or condition from the following list: blinded, cursed,
    dazed, deafened, diseased, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked,
    paralyzed, poisoned, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned. If that
    affliction or condition has a duration, it is suspended until this spell
    expires. If the subject has multiple instances of the same type of
    affliction (such as multiple diseases), a single casting of this spell can
    suspend only one of them. <i>Placebo effect</i> doesn't remove or
    temporarily negate any damage that the affliction may have already caused,
    nor does it provide protection against receiving such conditions again.</p>
