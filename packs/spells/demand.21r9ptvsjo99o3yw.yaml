      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.d0d86z521shpman1]{sending}, but the
      message can also contain a <em>suggestion</em> (see the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.zqj5qzyl46af27v0]{suggestion} spell),
      which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful Will save
      negates the <em>suggestion</em> effect but not the contact itself. The
      <em>demand</em>, if received, is understood even if the subject's
      Intelligence score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or
      meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at
      the time the <em>demand</em> is issued, the message is understood but the
      <em>suggestion</em> is ineffective.</p><p>The <em>demand's</em> message to
      the creature must be 25 words or less, including the <em>suggestion</em>.
      The creature can also give a short reply immediately.</p>
