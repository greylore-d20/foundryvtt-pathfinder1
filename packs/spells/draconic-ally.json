Treat this servant as a pseudodragon with all of the abilities granted by one of the following spells: <i>Form of the Alien Dragon I</i>, <i>form of the dragon I</i>, or <i>Form of the Exotic Dragon I</i>. Your <i>draconic ally</i> can use its breath weapon once per day. Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell's range, and can go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command. The <i>draconic ally</i> speaks one language of your choice that you know. You cannot have more than one <i>draconic ally</i> at a time. As long as a previous ally exists, you cannot successfully cast  this spell again. If you have a breath weapon, you can cast this spell as a standard action by expending one use of your breath weapon as a free action when you cast the spell.  Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship Apsu or Dahak add <i>draconic ally</i> to their spell lists as a 3rd-level spell.</p>",
