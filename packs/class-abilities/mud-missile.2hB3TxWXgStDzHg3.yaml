  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can fling a ball of hardened mud at a foe within 30
      feet as a standard action. If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, the
      mud slams into the targetâ€™s face, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage
      for every 2 wizard levels you have and blinding the target for 1d4 rounds.
      A creature can remove the blinding mud from itself or another creature
      with a successful Strength check (DC = 10 + half your wizard level) as a
      standard action. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
      to half your wizard level.</p>
