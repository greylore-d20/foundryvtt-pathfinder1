    value: >-
      <p>The target's wings grow more powerful, causing its fly speed to
      increase by +10 feet and its maneuverability to improve by one category
      (to a maximum of good). This increase counts as an enhancement bonus. This
      spell has no effect on wingless creatures or winged creatures that cannot
      fly.</p>
