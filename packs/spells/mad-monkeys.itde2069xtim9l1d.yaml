  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You summon a swarm of screeching, mischievous monkeys. The swarm
    understands and obeys your commands and has the statistics of a monkey swarm
    (<i>Bestiary 2</i> 212). Creatures failing a saving throw against the mad
    monkeys' distraction attack are deafened for 1 minute as well as nauseated.
    The monkeys attempt one disarm or steal combat maneuver each turn as a free
    action against any creature that begins its turn in the swarm, using your
    caster level plus your casting ability score bonus (Intelligence for
    wizards; Wisdom for druids; Charisma for bards, sorcerers, and summoners)
    for its CMB. Recovering an item from the monkeys requires a successful
    disarm or steal attempt against that CMB + 10. An object stolen by the
    monkeys takes swarm damage each round the swarm is in possession of the
    object.</p>
