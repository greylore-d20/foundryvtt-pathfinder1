Any creature that strikes you deals normal damage to you, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d8 points of force damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels you possess (maximum +10). This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
