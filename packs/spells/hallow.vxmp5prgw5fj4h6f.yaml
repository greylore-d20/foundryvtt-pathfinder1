  shortDescription: >-
    <p><i>Hallow</i> makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy
    site.</p><p>This has four major effects.</p><p>First, the site is warded by
    a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect.</p><p>Second, the DC to resist
    positive channeled energy within this area gains a +4 sacred bonus and the
    DC to resist negative energy is reduced by 4. Spell resistance does not
    apply to this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version of
    the spell.</p><p>Third, any dead body interred in a <i><i>hallow</i>ed</i>
    site cannot be turned into an undead creature.</p><p>Finally, you can fix a
    single spell effect to the <i><i>hallow</i>ed</i> site.</p><p>The spell
    effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless
    of the normal duration and area or effect.</p><p>You may designate whether
    the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or
    alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end
    of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced
    simply by casting <i>hallow</i> again.</p><p>Spell effects that may be tied
    to a <i><i>hallow</i>ed</i> site include <i>aid, bane, bless, cause fear,
    darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic,
    dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of
    movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist
    energy, silence, tongues,</i> and <i>zone of truth</i>. Saving throws and
    spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual
    spell descriptions for details.) An area can receive only one <i>hallow</i>
    spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. <i>Hallow</i> counters
    but does not dispel un<i>hallow</i>.</p>
