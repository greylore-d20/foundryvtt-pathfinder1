      text: Cannot be flanked
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This character can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue
      the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the
      attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has class
      levels.</p>

      <p>If a character already has
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.7WaQxnVaaoL4AGr8]{uncanny
      dodge}</em> (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes
      that grant <em>uncanny dodge</em> stack to determine the minimum rogue
      level required to flank the character.</p>
