  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.wgm8mm1za909pwch]{stone
    tell} but allows conversations only with a body of standing or flowing fresh
    water at least as large as you are. Flowing water can generally speak about
    events happening upstream but not events happening downstream.</p>
