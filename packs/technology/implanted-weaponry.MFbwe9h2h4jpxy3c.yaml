      2</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A single light melee weapon or one-handed
      firearm can be implanted in an arm or cybernetic arm. Melee weapons extend
      or retract as a swift action. Ranged weapons fire through a port on the
      palm or back of the wrist. Either type of weapon has statistics identical
      to its normal form. Firearms reload through a breach in the arm,
      increasing the reloading time of the weapon to a full-round action, or
      doubling reloading times that already take a full round or longer.
      Implanted weapons are well concealed; detecting one requires a thorough
      search (Perception DC 25). Implanted weaponry can be damaged or destroyed
      by sundering, but cannot be disarmed. Weaponry installed in a cybernetic
      arm does not count against a creature's implantation limit. The cost,
      price, and weight of the weapon to be implanted are added to the cost,
      price, and weight listed in this stat
      block.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 25;
