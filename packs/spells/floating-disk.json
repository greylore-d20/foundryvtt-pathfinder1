It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you.</p><p>The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires.</p><p>The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it.</p><p>When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.</p>",
