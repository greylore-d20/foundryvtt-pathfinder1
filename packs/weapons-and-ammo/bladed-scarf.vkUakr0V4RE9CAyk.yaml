  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Knowing that seductive performances can bring out the worst in
      watchers, some Varisians craft rows of razor-sharp blades into their
      scarves. The skill required in using such scarves effectively and not
      revealing their deadly nature makes them exotic weapons. If you are
      proficient with a bladed scarf, you deal 1d4 points of slashing damage to
      any creature that makes a successful grapple check against you while you
      wield the scarf. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your
      Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with
      a bladed scarf sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.</p>
