    value: >-
      <p>You remove all ongoing radiation effects, both primary and secondary,
      on a single target if you succeed at a caster level check (DC = the
      Fortitude DC associated with the radiation effect). In addition, you
      immediately restore 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of
      Strength drain caused by radiation-this spell cannot restore ability
      damage or drain caused by other sources. When cast on an area, a single
      casting of <i>remove radioactivity</i> removes radiation from a
      20-foot-radius area around the point you touch. This spell has no power to
      negate naturally radioactive materials, and as long as such materials
      remain in an area, the radiation that was removed may return.</p>
