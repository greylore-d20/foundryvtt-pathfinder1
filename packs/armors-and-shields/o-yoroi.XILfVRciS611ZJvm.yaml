  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Worn almost exclusively by highranking samurai, o-yoroi—or “great
      armor”—is a heavy combat armor that consists of various supplementary
      components that include both plate and lamellar elements. Each suit is
      crafted for a specific individual and displays the owner’s aesthetic. Upon
      completion, the suit is colored and sealed with a final lacquer finish.
      The centerpiece of o-yoroi is a cuirass consisting of two parts—a separate
      reinforcement for the right side called a waidate, and a kikko cuirass.
      The upper part of the waidate consists of a leather-covered iron plate.
      The cuirass’s leather shoulder straps—called watagami—are likewise armored
      with metal plates. Affixed to the cuirass are a number of supplementary
      pieces, including wide lamellar shoulder guards, a kikko sleeve for the
      shield arm, lacquered iron greaves worn over padded silk leggings, and a
      groin protector. The signature component of each suit of armor is the
      tiered kabuto helmet and its accompanying ho-ate mask. Ho-ate masks can be
      made of hardened leather or metal and are fashioned into fearsome visages
      such as oni, dragons, or other mythical beings.</p>
