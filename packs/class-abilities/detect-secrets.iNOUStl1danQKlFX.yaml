    value: >-
      <p>You have learned how to detect any of a creatureâ€™s secrets, not just
      its thoughts. Whenever you cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.0nw43wck6cgj5pi6]{Detect Anxieties},
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.spt9bts9a7fa8j7b]{Detect Desires}, or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.xllxylvvqr82o2d5]{Detect Thoughts} or use any of
      those spells as a spell-like ability, you can choose to gain the effects
      of one of the other two spells instead. You are never overwhelmed by a
      target of these spells that has a high ability score.</p>
