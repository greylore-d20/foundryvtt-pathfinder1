    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, a mental field emanates from you, touching the minds of
      those nearby. Any creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will
      save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its saving
      throw is immune to your hallucinogenic aura for 24 hours. A creature that
      fails its save doesn’t need to continue making saves while it’s confused
      by this aura, and becomes immune for 24 hours once its confusion ends.
      This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p>You’re immune to your own hallucinogenic aura, as well as that of any
      other psychic. You can brew an antidote that protects the imbiber from
      your aura. Brewing 1 dose requires 1 hour and a successful DC 15 Craft
      (alchemy) check. One dose’s effects last for 1 month.</p>
