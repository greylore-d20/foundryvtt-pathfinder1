  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the arcanist encounters a primal magic event, as an immediate
      action she can attempt to consume its power, as the consume spells class
      feature. The arcanist must succeed at a Fortitude save equal to 10 + the
      CR of the primal magic event, or she fails to consume the event and is
      staggered for 1d4 rounds.</p>

      <p>The arcanist must have the swift consume exploit to select this
      exploit.</p>
