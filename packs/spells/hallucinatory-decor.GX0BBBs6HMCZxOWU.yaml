      <p>You transform the decor of a courtyard, structure, or other edifice to
      meet your highest standards and personal tastes. Objects and architectural
      elements remain in the same configuration — a chair remains a chair — but
      can look, sound, and smell like a different physical material and artistic
      style. You cannot change the appearance of natural terrain, but landscaped
      areas such as a garden or orchard can be affected. This spell functions in
      all other ways as @Compendium[pf1.spells.a2y1yf0a4jy3610w]{Hallucinatory
      Terrain}.</p>

      <p>Members of the Prophet of Kalistrade prestige class can cast this
      spell, even though it is not a divination or enchantment.</p>
