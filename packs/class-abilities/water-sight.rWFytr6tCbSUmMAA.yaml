    value: >-
      <p>You can see through fog and mist without penalty as long as there is
      enough light to allow you to see normal.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, you can use any calm pool of water at least 1 foot in
      diameter as a scrying device, as if using the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g66w32kdup1f43bp]{Scrying} spell.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, this functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.glt6uk3n6g6l2p6l]{Scrying, Greater}.</p>

      <p>You can use the scrying abilities for a number of rounds per day equal
      to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
