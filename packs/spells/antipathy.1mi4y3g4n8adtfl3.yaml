      <p>You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that
      repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a
      particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be
      affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific
      enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be
      named.</p><p>Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to
      leave the area or to avoid the affected item.</p><p>A compulsion forces
      them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly
      returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a
      successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels
      uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's
      Dexterity score by 4 points.</p><p><i>Antipathy</i> counters and dispels
