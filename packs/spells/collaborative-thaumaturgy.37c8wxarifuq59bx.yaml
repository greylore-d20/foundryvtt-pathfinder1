    value: >-
      <p>You tap into the magical resonance between you and your allies to
      enhance one another's magic. Cast this spell when an ally casts a spell at
      least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast.</p><p>The
      ally casts her spell as if one of the following metamagic feats were
      applied to it without increasing the spell level or casting time: Enlarge
      Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. If the ally is the
      target of two <i>collaborative thaumaturgy</i> spells when casting a
      spell, the ally can instead apply the Empower Spell metamagic feat to a
      spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast.
      Finally, if the ally is the target of three <i>collaborative
      thaumaturgy</i> spells when casting a spell, she can instead apply the
      Maximize Spell or Widen Spell metamagic feat to a spell at least 3 levels
      lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. You can't target yourself
      with <i>collaborative thaumaturgy</i>.</p>
