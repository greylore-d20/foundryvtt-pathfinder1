  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>rage</i>, except it affects only undead
      creatures and bolsters them with necromantic energy rather than emotion.
      Each affected creature gains a +2 profane bonus to Strength and Charisma,
      a +1 profane bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. The effect is
      otherwise identical to a barbarian's <i>rage</i>.</p>
