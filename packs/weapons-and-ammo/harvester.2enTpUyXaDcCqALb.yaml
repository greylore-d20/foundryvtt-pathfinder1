      Siege Engine</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A variety of scythe-like blades
      extend from two sides of this wheeled machine. When it's pulled-typically
      by an aurochs or enslaved giants-the wheels' rotation causes the blades to
      slash indiscriminately. Each round the harvester moves, it makes a melee
      attack with a +10 modifier against any adjacent creature it passes; it
      deals 2d8 points of damage to those it hits. Multiple harvesters can be
      strung together. The crew required for a train of harvesters is equal to
      the total crew of the individual machines. Adjacent creatures are attacked
      by each individual harvester that passes them. A harvester has a hardness
      of 5 and 50 hit points.</p><p>A harvester is a Large siege engine.</p>
