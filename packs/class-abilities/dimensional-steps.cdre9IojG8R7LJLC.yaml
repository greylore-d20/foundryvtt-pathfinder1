    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can use this ability to teleport up to 30 feet per
      wizard level per day as a standard action. This teleportation must be used
      in 5-foot increments and such movement does not provoke an <em>attack of
      opportunity</em>. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you
      must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature
      brought with you.</p>
