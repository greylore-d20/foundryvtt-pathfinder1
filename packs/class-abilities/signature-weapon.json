He gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.n250dFlbykAIAg5Z]{Weapon Focus} as a bonus feat for his selected weapon type. If he already has the Weapon Focus feat with the selected weapon, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he chose Weapon Focus in the selected weapon.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, he also gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.YLCvMNeAF9V31m1h]{Weapon Specialization} as a bonus feat for his selected weapon. He doesn’t have to meet any of the prerequisites for these feats.</p>\n<p>Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.</p>"
