  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Anytime a harmless (so noted by a spell's saving throw description)
      spell of 3rd level or lower is cast within a <i>covetous</i> aura's area
      of effect, you may choose to immediately gain the benefit of that spell as
      if it had also targeted you. The intended target still gains the effect of
      the spell. You gain the benefits of this duplicated spell only if the
      caster is in range of the <i>covetous</i> aura. You are considered the
      caster of the additional spell effect. If the effect allows for multiple
      targets other than yourself, you cannot use the stolen spell effect to
      target other creatures-a <i>covetous</i> aura only aids you. Once you
      choose to gain the benefit of another spell, the <i>covetous</i> aura
      immediately ends. Rumors hold that this unusual spell was invented
      thousands of years ago by Runelord Belimarius, who was constantly jealous
      of other spellcasters' abilities.</p>
