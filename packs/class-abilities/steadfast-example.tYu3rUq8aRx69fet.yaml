  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman touches a willing creature and bolsters its mental and
      emotional defenses. The next time the target attempts a Will saving throw,
      the subject can use the shamanâ€™s Will saving throw bonus instead of his
      own.</p>

      <p>The shaman can have only one creature under the effect of this hex at a
      time, and a creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again
      for 24 hours.</p>
