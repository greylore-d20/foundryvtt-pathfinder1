  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, you become a herald of the apocalypse and
      wield the awesome power to fulf ill such prophecy. Anytime you
      successfully cast a spell or use an ability that bestows 1 or more
      negative levels, the effect bestows 1d4 additional negative levels.
      Whenever you confirm a critical hit against a creature (including with a
      melee, ranged, or spell attack), as a swift action you can curse the
      target of your attack, as the bestow curse spell, except the target
      doesnâ€™t receive a Will saving throw to negate the effects and spell
      resistance does not apply against this ability.</p>
