    value: >-
      <p>You draw upon your body's inner reserves of strength, leaving you
      winded. When you are about to make a d20 roll based on Strength,
      Dexterity, or Constitution, you can cast this spell to gain a +8
      enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for that roll,
      but you are fatigued for 1 round afterward.</p>
