      <p>This spell functions as <i>create</i> pitAPG, except the pit is capable
      of movement. As a move action, you can direct the pit to move up to 20
      feet, though it must always remain on a horizontal surface large enough to
      accommodate its area. If the pit's movement causes it to share a space
      with a creature on the same horizontal surface, that creature must succeed
      at a Reflex saving throw or fall into the pit. Any creature that avoids
      falling into the pit when it reaches its new destination moves to the
      nearest safe space. Creatures that fall into the pit move with it if it is
      relocated.</p>
