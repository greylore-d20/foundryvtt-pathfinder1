    value: >-
      <p>While many who dabble in the arcane become adept at beckoning monsters
      from the farthest reaches of the planes, none are more skilled at it than
      the summoner. This practitioner of the arcane arts forms a close bond with
      one particular outsider, known as an eidolon, who gains power as the
      summoner becomes more proficient at his summoning. Over time, the two
      become linked, eventually even sharing a shard of the same soul. But this
      power comes with a price: the summoner’s spells and abilities are limited
      due to his time spent enhancing the power and exploring the nature of his
      eidolon.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Summoners spend much of their time
      exploring the arcane arts alongside their eidolons. While their power
      comes from within, they rely heavily on their eidolon companions in
      dangerous situations. While a summoner and his eidolon function as
      individuals, their true power lies in what they can accomplish
      together.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The summoner’s class skills are Craft
      (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics
      (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic
      Device (Cha).</p>
