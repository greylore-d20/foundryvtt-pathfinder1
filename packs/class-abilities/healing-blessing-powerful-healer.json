As a swift action, you can treat any cure spell as if it were empowered (as the @Compendium[pf1.feats.77gXSucrxfrE9yWk]{Empower Spell} feat), causing it to heal 50% more damage (or deal 50% more damage if used against undead).</p>\n<p>This ability doesnâ€™t stack with itself or the Empower Spell feat.</p>"
