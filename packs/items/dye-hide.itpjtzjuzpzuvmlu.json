Hide dye can be applied to the feathers, fur, scales, or skin of most types of <em>animals</em> and <em>magical beasts</em>, allowing creatures a measure of camouflage.</p>\n<p>Hide dye comes in a variety of colors and shades matching the following different kinds of terrain: cold (including ice, glaciers, snow, and tundra), desert, forest, jungle, mountain (including hills), plains, swamp, underground, urban, and water.</p>\n<p>One jar of hide dye can be applied to a Small or smaller <em>animal</em> or <em>magical beast</em> in 1 hour. Thereafter, the dyed creature gains a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Stealth</em> checks in the associated terrain.</p>\n<p>If the Environment entry in a creature's statistics indicates that the creature can typically be found in a specific type of terrain (such as an <em>owl's</em> environment of temperate forests) and the creature is adorned with hide dye of a matching type, the bonus on <em>Stealth</em> checks increases to +4. Applying a new color of dye immediately covers and replaces the previous dye.</p>\n<p>Hide dye doesn't adhere to clothing or <em>humanoid</em> flesh, and grants no benefit to creatures other than <em>animals</em> or <em>magical beasts</em>. Once applied, hide dye is waterproof and can't be rubbed or burned away. It fades after 1d4+1 days unless it's removed earlier by magical means.</p>"
