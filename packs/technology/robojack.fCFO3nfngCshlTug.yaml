      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>

      charge</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A robojack is a strange, rod-like device
      that can be used to usurp control of an otherwise functional robot. In
      order to gain control of a robot, the wielder must first make a ranged
      touch attack against a target robot within a range of 60 feet. If the
      attack is successful, the robot must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw
      to prevent the robojack from linking to the robot's command processor. On
      a subsequent turn after a link is established, the wielder can issue a
      command to the robot as a standard action-each attempt to do so consumes 1
      charge from the robojack, and the robot gets a new DC 14 Will saving throw
      to resist following each command. The wielder must be within 60 feet of
      the robot and must issue the command in a language understood by the
      robot. The types of commands he can issue are similar to those allowed by
      a @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.zqj5qzyl46af27v0]{suggestion}
      spell-once a command is successfully issued, the robot does its best to
      carry out the orders over the course of the next hour. This does not drain
      further charges from the
      robojack.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 29;
