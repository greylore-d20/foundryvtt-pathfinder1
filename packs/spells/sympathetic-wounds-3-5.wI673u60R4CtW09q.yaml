      <p>This spell functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.menqakfoa1ftvi3f]{shield other}, except some of
      your wounds transfer to the targeted creature rather than some of their
      wounds transferring to you. For example, you could link yourself to a
      nearby chained slave so that when you are wounded, some of the damage is
      transferred to the slave. You must have at least as many hit dice as the
      target, otherwise the spell fails. A creature can only be under the
      effects of one instance of this spell at a time.</p>
