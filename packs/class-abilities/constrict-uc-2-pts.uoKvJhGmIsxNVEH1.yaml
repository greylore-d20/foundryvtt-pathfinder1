      <p><b>Requirements:</b> Serpentine base form, grab evolution.</p>

      <p>The eidolon gains powerful muscles that allow it to crush those it
      grapples. Whenever the eidolon successfully grapples a foe using the grab
      evolution, it deals additional damage equal to the amount of damage dealt
      by the attack the grab evolution is tied to.</p>
