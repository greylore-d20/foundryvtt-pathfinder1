This allows you to use your windsight wild talent to catch a quick glimpse and hear a tiny snippet from any location that could be reached by the wind traveling that distance (the wind’s path can’t pass through openings smaller than 1 inch in diameter). The breeze travels 100 feet per round, so what you see and hear is delayed by 1 round for every 50 feet of the path. If you spend at least 10 minutes to set up a steady flow of wind, you can concentrate for up to 1 minute per level to gain continuous visual and auditory information for as long as you concentrate, delayed by 1 round for every 100 feet the wind travels (since the steady flow of wind has to travel only one way).</p>\n<p>While there is no invisible sensor to detect with this ability, creatures along the path of the breeze may notice a light wind, though it may not seem out of the ordinary.</p>"
