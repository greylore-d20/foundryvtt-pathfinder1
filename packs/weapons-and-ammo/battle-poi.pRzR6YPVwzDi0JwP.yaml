      Groups</b> Flails</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This pair of arm-length chains
      has handles at one end and heavy fuel-soaked torch heads at the other. The
      weight of the poi is insufficient to deal physical damage, but the burning
      fuel deals fire damage. If you are proficient in battle poi, you are
      treated as if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for the purposes of
      making poi attacks. Poi can be extinguished by spending a full round
      action smothering them in sand or submerging them in water.</p>
