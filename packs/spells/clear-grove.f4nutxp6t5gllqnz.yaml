  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Trees, shrubs, and other thick vegetation move out of the spell's area.
    The affected area is cleared of all vegetation thick enough to provide cover
    or concealment. This also creates a hole in any tree canopy, allowing
    sunlight to pass through. Affected trees and undergrowth form a 5-foot-wide
    ring along the edge of the clearing, which may provide cover or concealment
    based on the thickness of the vegetation (at the GM's discretion).  This
    spell doesn't affect creatures of the plant type. The spell can affect
    vegetation altered with spells of equal or lower level (such as
    <i>entangle</i> or <i>spike</i> growth). When the spell ends, the trees and
    undergrowth move back to their original places unless they're destroyed or
    somehow restrained (the amount of time this takes is subject to the GM's
    discretion).</p>
