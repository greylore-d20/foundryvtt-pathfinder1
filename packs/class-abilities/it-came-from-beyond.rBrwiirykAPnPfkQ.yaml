  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day when you cast a summoning spell, any one creature you
      summon is more powerful than normal. The creature gains the advanced
      creature simple template. If you summon more than one creature with a
      spell, only one of the summoned creatures gains the advanced creature
      simple template. A summoned creature that gains the advanced creature
      simple template in this manner looks unusually deformed or hideous. This
      ability only works on spells you cast as a clericâ€”it does not work on
      spellcasting abilities gained from any other spellcasting classes you
      might have.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Guarded Mind power of the Void Domain.</p>
