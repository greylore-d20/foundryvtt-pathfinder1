  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a greater elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) bound in
      the form of a mighty chariot that moves at your command and can carry up
      to nine Medium creatures.</p><p>Passengers inside are not harmed by the
      elemental, and can see, breathe, and act normally, suffering no
      environmental damage even when the elemental chariot is flying,
      underwater, burrowing, or using earth glide. Passengers are not otherwise
      protected, though the elemental chariot does provide cover like a normal
      chariot.</p><p>The elemental keeps all of its statistics and abilities,
      except it loses its slam attacks and gains a trample attack
      (<i>Pathfinder</i> <i>RPG Bestiary</i> 305).</p><p>When you use a
      summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a
      spell of that type.</p><p>This spell is almost exclusively used by the
      Green Faith.</p>
