  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day as a full-round action, your form ripples and releases
      seven illusory duplicates, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.4jsss37x0pplib8f]{Mirror Image}, and then you can
      move up to your speed in any direction, while the duplicates move in seven
      other directions. The duplicates continue to retreat in their chosen
      direction, avoiding walls and other barriers but unable to open doors or
      interact with objects. The duplicates last for 1 minute per oracle level
      or until they take damage (they have the same AC as your touch AC and the
      same Reflex save as you, and they are immune to effects that allow a
      Fortitude or Will save). You can use this ability an additional time per
      day at 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This is a figment
      effect.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
