  shortDescription: >-
    <p>While the target of this spell is asleep, she retains some of her normal
    powers of perception. While she tunes out harmless sounds such as the
    crackling of the campfire, crickets, or light breezes, she does not take the
    normal +10 modifier to the DC of Perception checks she attempts while
    asleep.</p><p>If the target detects a threat or unexplained noise while
    sleeping, she can wake immediately and stand up from her sleeping position
    as a free action.</p><p>If the target is roused but returns to sleep during
    the spell's duration, she falls asleep immediately and does not count as
    having her sleep interrupted, even if she engaged in combat while she was
    awake.</p>
