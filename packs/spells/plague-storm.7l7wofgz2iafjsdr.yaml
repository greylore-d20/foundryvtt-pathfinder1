    value: >-
      <p>You create a hideous gray cloud, similar to <i>fog cloud</i>, that
      occasionally crackles with foul-smelling bolts of sickly green lightning.
      Creatures in the area must save or contract one of the following diseases:
      blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, demon fever, devil
      chills, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom
      (the disease is chosen by you when you cast the spell and applies to all
      creatures that fail the save). The disease is contracted immediately (the
      onset period does not apply) and is an instantaneous effect. Use the
      disease's listed frequency to determine further effects, but the disease's
      save DC increases by +2. For more information see page 557 of the <i>Core
      Rulebook</i>.</p><p>Unlike a <i>fog cloud</i>, the <i>plague storm</i>
      moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the
      ground.</p><p>Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its
      new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of
      origin where you cast the spell.</p><p>Because the vapors are heavier than
      air, they sink to the lowest level of the terrain, even pouring down den
      or sinkhole openings. The cloud cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be
      cast underwater.</p>
