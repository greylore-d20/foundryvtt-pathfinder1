An alchemy crafting kit provides no bonuses on @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.3E8pxbjI8MD3JbfQ]{Craft (alchemy)} checks. (This item was previously called an \"alchemist's kit\", and was renamed to avoid confusion with the set of adventuring gear called an \"alchemist's kit.\")</p>"
