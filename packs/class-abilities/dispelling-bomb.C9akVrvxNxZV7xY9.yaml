        <p>The creature is the target of the <em>dispel magic</em> spell. You
        make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the
        spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If
        successful, that spell ends.</p><p>If not, compare the same result to
        the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until
        you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to
        dispel every spell.</p><p>For example, a 7th-level caster casts
        <em>dispel magic</em>, targeting a creature affected by
        <em>stoneskin</em> (caster level 12th) and <em>fly</em> (caster level
        6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high
        enough to end the <em>stoneskin</em> (which would have required a 23 or
        higher), but it is high enough to end the <em>fly</em> (which only
        required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the
        <em>stoneskin</em> would have been dispelled, leaving the <em>fly</em>
        intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have
        been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically
        end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such
        as a <em>wall of fire</em>). You must name the specific spell effect to
        be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or
        higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on
        the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the
        targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the
        effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster <em>summoned</em> by
        <em>summon monster</em>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that
        conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is
        a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level
        (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's
        magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item
        recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical
        for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a
        <em>bag of holding</em>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical
        properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a
        masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by
        mortal magic such as this.</p>

      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel
      magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit
      from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic} spell, using the
      alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a
      specific spell effect.</p>

      <p>The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
