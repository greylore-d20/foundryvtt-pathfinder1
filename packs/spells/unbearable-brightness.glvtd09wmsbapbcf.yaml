  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Your body glows with a terrible light. Creatures within 30 feet of you
    that can see you are dazzled (no saving throw).</p><p>Creatures with light
    sensitivity must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be blinded. This light
    counts as <i>daylight</i> for the purpose of affecting darkness effects (and
    vice versa).</p><p>If the emanation enters an area under the effect of
    magical darkness (or vice versa), both effects are temporarily negated so
    that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping
    areas of effect. Dazzled and blinded conditions from your light end when the
    spell ends or when the creature is out of line of sight.</p>
