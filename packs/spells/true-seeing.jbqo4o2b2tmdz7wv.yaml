      <p>You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they
      actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness,
      notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of
      creatures or objects under <i>blur</i> or <i>displacement</i> effects,
      sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and
      sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further,
      the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not
      into extradimensional spaces). The range of <i>true seeing</i> conferred
      is 120 feet.</p><p><i>True seeing</i>, however, does not penetrate solid
      objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not
      negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. <i>True
      seeing</i> does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot
      creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane
      means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with
      known magic, so one cannot use <i>true seeing</i> through a <i>crystal
      ball</i> or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.</p>
