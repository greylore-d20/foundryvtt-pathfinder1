  shortDescription: >-
    <p>When this spell is active, you feel a mental pull in the direction of any
    active or operable portal leading to another plane within range of the
    spell. If multiple portals are present, you are pulled only to the nearest
    one. If moving causes you to become closer to a different portal, you become
    drawn to that one instead. The spell gives you the direction of the portal
    only, not a route. Once you are within 10 feet of the portal, you no longer
    feel the pull, only the portal's presence. The spell does not pinpoint or
    otherwise reveal hidden portals, nor does it do anything to aid in opening
    or operating them.</p>
