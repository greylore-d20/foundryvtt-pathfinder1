  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a contingent ward that defies those who would dispel your
      magic, convincing them that their spell worked. When a spell such as
      <i>dispel magic</i> would end one of your spells that's affecting you, you
      can dismiss <i>deceptive redundancy</i> as an immediate action to attempt
      an opposed caster level check against the spellcaster. If you succeed, the
      dispelling effect fails to end your spell, and your spell's aura becomes
      difficult to detect for 1 round per caster level. Any divination attempted
      during this time fails to perceive the spell's aura unless the caster
      succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 15 + your caster level).
      <i>Deceptive redundancy</i> is most effective when hiding auras for spells
      that don't have easily perceived effects, rather than visually obvious
      spells such as <i>enlarge person</i> or <i>fire shield</i>.</p>
