She becomes dying or dead at the end of her next turn as normal for her current hit point total. This ability has no effect if the barbarian dies from a cause other than hit point damage, such as from a death effect or if her Constitution damage exceeds her Constitution score.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must be at least 10th level and have the lesser cult totem and cult totem rage powers to select this rage power.</p>"
