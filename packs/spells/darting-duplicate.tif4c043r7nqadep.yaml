      <p>An illusory duplicate of you steps clumsily into an adjacent square,
      presenting a tempting target before winking out of existence. Any creature
      that threatens that square must succeed at a Will save or make an attack
      of opportunity against the image. The image's AC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your
      caster level, but as a figment, the image is unaffected by any attack.</p>
