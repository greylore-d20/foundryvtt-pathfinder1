  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can create a 20-foot aura that causes enemies
      within to be overcome with feelings of isolation and loss. Your enemies
      treat the aura as difficult terrain, as they become sluggish within its
      area of effect. Furthermore, while within the aura, your enemies canâ€™t
      flank with one another, nor can they use or benefit from the aid another
      action. The aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier, but the rounds need not be consecutive. This is a mind-affecting
      emotion effect.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Part the Veil power of the Void Domain.</p>
