      <p>You deprive a creature of the blissful oblivion of unconsciousness,
      either to keep it going despite grievous injuries or to prolong its
      suffering. For the duration of the spell, the target gains the ferocity
      ability (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 300), allowing it to remain
      conscious and continue fighting even if its hit point total is below 0.
      The target is still staggered and loses 1 hit point each round, and the
      target still dies when its hit point total reaches a negative amount equal
      to its Constitution score.</p>
