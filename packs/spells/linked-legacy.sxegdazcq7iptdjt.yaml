      <p>This spell helps build community and ensure a shared vision for the
      future. When any of the affected creatures succeeds at a Knowledge check
      to answer a question within its field of study or identify a monster and
      its special powers or vulnerabilities, as a free action the affected
      creature can share any information gained automatically with all targets
      of the spell. If any of the targets move out of the spell's range, the
      spell ceases to function for all of them until they are all within close
      range of you again.</p>
