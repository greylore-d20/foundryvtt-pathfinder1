      square of impact must succeed on a DC 12 <em>Fortitude</em> save to resist
      the powder, while those in adjacent squares must make DC 8
      <em>Fortitude</em> saves. Creatures affected by sneezing powder must make
      a DC 10 <em>Fortitude</em> save every round for the duration or be
      <em>staggered</em> until their next turn.</p>
