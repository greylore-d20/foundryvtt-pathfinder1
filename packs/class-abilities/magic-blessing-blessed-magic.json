      "value": "<p>At 10th level, you can cast a prepared warpriest spell without expending its spell slot. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action and must use a spell slot that is at least 3 spell levels lower than the highest warpriest spell level you can cast. In addition, the spell must be one that damages a creature or causes a creature to take penalties (such as&nbsp;inflict light wounds&nbsp;or&nbsp;bane). For example, if you are 10th level and can cast 4th-level warpriest spells, you could use this blessing to cast a 1st-level warpriest spell without expending its spell slot.</p>"
