  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This rapier like weapon has a thicker blade than normal, which is
      shaped into a corkscrewing spiral of sharpened edges. These edges can
      catch enemy weapons, making it ideal for disarming or parrying. You can
      use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of
      your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiral rapier sized for you,
      even though it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a spiral rapier in
      two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to its
      damage. Any effects that apply to rapiers also apply to a spiral
      rapier.</p>
