  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You afflict a creature you have conjured via <i>planar ally</i> (or a
    similar spell) with bolts of vicious energy. These foul energies inflict
    terrible pain upon the summoned creature, torturing it to make it more
    pliant to your will. The targeted creature must make a Fortitude save or
    take a -1 penalty for every 2 levels you possess (maximum -10) on all saves
    and checks made against you for the next hour. In addition, creatures that
    demand payment for their services reduce the payment by 20% for every 4
    levels you possess (maximum 60% reduction). However, beings tortured by this
    spell quickly come to resent you, making them more likely to try to pervert
    your orders to malicious ends or try to seek retribution after their
    release. This spell has no effect on creatures that are immune to nonlethal
    damage.</p>
