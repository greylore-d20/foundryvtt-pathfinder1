  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a shallow extradimensional hole perfectly sized to trip anyone
    who steps within it. This hole occupies a single 5-foot square with a depth
    of six inches. Any creature occupying the square when you first create the
    hole, or who later steps into the square containing the hole, must make a
    Reflex saving throw to avoid falling prone in an adjacent square and taking
    1d6 points of damage. A creature that makes its saving throw still stumbles
    ever so slightly and takes a -1 penalty on all rolls and checks for 1 round.
    The spell has no effect on creatures adjacent to the square containing the
    hole.</p>
