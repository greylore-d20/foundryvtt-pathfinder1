      <p>You ignore the physical detriments of being middle-aged. This spell
      does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of
      old age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the -1
      penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you
      become middle-aged. You retain the agerelated bonuses to Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma while under the effects of this spell. Additional
      penalties that you accrue upon becoming old or venerable apply in
      full.</p>
