  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a
      bone ward. The warded creature becomes encircled by a group of flying
      bones that grant it a +2 deflection bonus to AC for a number of rounds
      equal to the shamanâ€™s level.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the ward increases to +3 and lasts for 1 minute.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the bonus increases to +4 and lasts for 1 hour.</p>

      <p>Once the bone ward ends, the creature cannot be the target of the hex
      again for 24 hours.</p>
