    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes even commonly used objects to become conundrums. When
      cast on a creature, the target loses all weapon and shield proficiencies.
      The target also forgets how to use all spell-completion, spell-trigger,
      and use-activated magic items, as well as any mundane items used as part
      of a skill check, imposing a -5 penalty on all ability and skill checks
      attempted with such items. These effects last for 1 round per level. As a
      move action, the target can attempt a skill check to negate the effects of
      this spell for one object. Weapons, shields, and mundane objects require a
      successful Craft skill check of the type required to craft the item in
      question, with a DC equal to the spell's save DC. Magic items require a
      successful Spellcraft or Use Magic Device skill check against the spell's
      save DC.  Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a single touched object
      that weighs up to 5 pounds per the caster's level. Use of this object
      becomes a puzzle even to those previously familiar with it. Any creature
      attempting to use an item affected in this way is treated as though the
      creature was the target of <i>puzzle box</i> for that item only. When cast
      on an object, the duration of this spell is permanent.</p>
