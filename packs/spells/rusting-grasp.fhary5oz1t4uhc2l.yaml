  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the item
      is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-footradius
      volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are
      immune to this spell.</p><p>You may employ <i>rusting grasp</i> in combat
      with a successful melee touch attack. <i>Rusting grasp</i> used in this
      way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of AC gained from metal armor (to
      the maximum amount of protection the armor offers) through
      corrosion.</p><p>Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are
      more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against
      the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Striking at an
      opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch
      the weapon and not the other way around.</p><p>Against a ferrous creature,
      <i>rusting grasp</i> instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage + 1 per
      caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1
      round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.</p>
