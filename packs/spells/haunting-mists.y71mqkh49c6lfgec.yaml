      <p>An illusion of misty vapor inhabited by shadowy shapes arises around
      you. It is stationary. The illusory mist obscures all sight, including
      darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks
      have a 20% miss chance).</p><p>Creatures farther away have total
      concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate
      the target).</p><p>All creatures within the mist must save or take 1d2
      points of Wisdom damage and gain the shaken condition. The shaken
      condition lasts as long as the creature remains in the mist.</p>
