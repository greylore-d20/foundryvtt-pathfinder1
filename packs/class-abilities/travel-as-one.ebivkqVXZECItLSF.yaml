  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast a spell with the teleportation descriptor, treat your
      caster level as 3 higher for the purpose of determining how many
      additional creatures you can bring with you. In addition, you and any
      creatures you teleport gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your
      level that disappear after you reach your destination; these offset any
      damage you might take from teleportation mishaps or attempting to teleport
      into a solid body.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the base speed increase of the Travel Domain.</p>
