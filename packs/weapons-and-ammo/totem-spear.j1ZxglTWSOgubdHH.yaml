  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Favored by the Shoanti of the Sklar-Quah, totem spears combine deadly
      weapons with the mournful music of Varisia's displaced natives. The
      shovel-like heads of these broad spears are decorated with variously
      oriented hollows. In addition to its use as a weapon, a totem spear can be
      played using the Perform (wind instrument) skill.</p>
