    value: >-
      <p>You focus your anger against an enemy. Choose one enemy creature that
      you can see. You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage
      rolls against that designated creature for every three caster levels you
      have (at least +1, maximum +3). You also receive this bonus on caster
      level checks made to overcome the creature's spell resistance, if any. At
      12th level, you gain the benefits of the Improved Critical feat on attack
      rolls made against the designated creature. This effect doesn't stack with
      any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.</p>
