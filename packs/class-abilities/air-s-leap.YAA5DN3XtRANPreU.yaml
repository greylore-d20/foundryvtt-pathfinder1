      <p>You are always considered to have a running start when jumping, you add
      your kineticist level as a bonus on all Acrobatics checks to jump, you
      jump twice as far or high as the results of your check indicate, and you
      can accept 1 point of burn when jumping to double the distance you jump
      again (to a total of four times as far).</p>
