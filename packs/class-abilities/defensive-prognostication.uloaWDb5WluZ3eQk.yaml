  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her
      future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a
      divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of
      rounds equal to the linked spellâ€™s level. She can instead spend 2 points
      to increase the bonus to +4.</p>

      <p>This amplification can be linked only to divination spells.</p>
