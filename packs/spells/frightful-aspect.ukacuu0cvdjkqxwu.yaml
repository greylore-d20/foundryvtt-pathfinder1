    value: >-
      <p>You become a larger, awful version of yourself. You grow to size Large,
      and take on features that horrify your enemies. You gain the following
      abilities: a +6 size bonus to Strength, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, a
      +6 natural armor bonus, DR 10/magic, and spell resistance equal to 10 +
      half your caster level. You also emit an aura that emanates 30 feet from
      you. Enemy creatures within the aura are shaken. Each time a creature
      shaken by this aura hits you with a melee attack, that creature becomes
      frightened for 1d4 rounds, though at the end of that duration it is no
      longer affected by this aura. The aura's effect is a fear and
      mind-affecting effect.</p>
