      "value": "<p>At 5th level, a kineticist gains the ability to alter her kinetic blasts as if with metamagic feats by accepting burn. By accepting 1 point of burn, she can empower her kinetic blast (as if using @Compendium[pf1.feats.77gXSucrxfrE9yWk]{Empower Spell}).</p>\n<p>At 9th level, by accepting 2 points of burn, she can maximize her kinetic blast as if using @Compendium[pf1.feats.J1yi4hFKYdXqZE3h]{Maximize Spell}.</p>\n<p>At 13th level, by accepting 3 points of burn, she can quicken her kinetic blast as if using @Compendium[pf1.feats.wFoLrh5FeeqBXsQ8]{Quicken Spell}.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, by accepting 4 points of burn, the kineticist can use her kinetic blast twice with the same standard action, or swift action if she also uses metakinesis to quicken the blast.</p>\n<p>When she uses a double kinetic blast, all modifications, such as metakinesis and infusions, apply to both of the blasts, but the kineticist needs to pay the burn cost only once.</p>"
