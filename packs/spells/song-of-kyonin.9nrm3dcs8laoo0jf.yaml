    value: >-
      <p>Certain elven bards of Kyonin are known for the restorative power of
      their performances-mostly as a result of this spell. You must have a
      bardic performance in effect to cast this spell (although this spell is
      called <i>song of Kyonin</i>, the bardic performance need not be singing).
      As long as that performance continues, up to 3 creatures affected by the
      performance gain fast healing 2. When this bardic performance ends or you
      change to a different bardic performance, the fast healing granted by this
      spell ends as well, but all creatures affected by this spell heal 1d8
      points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) and are cured of
      any of the following conditions: exhausted, fatigued, nauseated,
      paralyzed, sickened, or stunned.</p>
