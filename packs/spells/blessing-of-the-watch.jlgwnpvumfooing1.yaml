  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>bless</i>, except as noted. It works only
      in the caster's home city, and in areas under the jurisdiction of the city
      watch. For example, if the watch patrols a shantytown outside the city
      walls but not the ruined subterranean tunnels that lie beneath the city,
      the spell works in the former area but not the latter.</p>
