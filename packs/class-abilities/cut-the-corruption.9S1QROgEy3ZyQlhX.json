For 1 minute, the weapon glows with a deep-green light and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against aberrations and undead. This damage does not stack with the additional damage granted by the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bane\">bane</a> weapon special ability. At 16th level, the cavalier can use this ability a second time each day.</p>"
