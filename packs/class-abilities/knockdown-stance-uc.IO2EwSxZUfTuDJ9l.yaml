  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian can focus on toppling her foes. Once per round, she can
      make a trip attack against one target in place of a melee attack. If she
      succeeds, the target is knocked prone. This trip attempt doesnâ€™t provoke
      an attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>
