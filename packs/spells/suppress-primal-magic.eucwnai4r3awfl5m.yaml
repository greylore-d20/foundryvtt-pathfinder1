  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Nexian wizards first created this spell while researching the nature of
    the Mana Wastes, hoping to create small zones within the magic-starved
    region where their own spells could still function reliably. The best the
    Nexians could manage was this spell-a method to temporarily stabilize magic
    so that spellcasting within a small area can be accomplished without fear of
    triggering primal magic events. In the area of effect of this spell, primal
    magic events cannot be triggered.</p><p>The emanation grants a +4
    circumstance bonus on all saving throws against effects generated by primal
    magic outside of the spell's effect that expand into the
    area.</p><p>Unfortunately, suppressed primal magic tends to build up around
    the emanation created by this spell. When <i>suppress primal magic</i>'s
    duration ends (or when the spell is dispelled), a primal magic event is
    immediately triggered at the center of the emanation if that point is still
    in an area where primal magic is active. The CR of this event is equal to
    the caster level of the recently ended <i>suppress primal magic</i> spell.
    The original caster of the <i>suppress primal magic</i> spell can attempt to
    negate this triggered primal magic event by making a DC 20 Will save-most
    spellcasters instead relocate to an area not affected by primal magic if
    they can so that they can end the spell's effect safely.</p>
