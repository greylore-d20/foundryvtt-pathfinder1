    "shortDescription": "<p><i>Fire trap</i> creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A <i>fire trap</i> spell can ward any object that can be opened and closed.</p><p>When casting <i>fire trap</i>, you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.</p><p>A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A <i>knock</i> spell does not bypass a <i>fire trap</i>. An unsuccessful <i>dispel magic</i> spell does not detonate the spell.</p><p>Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.</p><p>You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.</p><p>Magic traps such as <i>fire trap</i> are hard to detect and disable. A character with trapfinding can use the Perception skill to find a <i>fire trap</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid's <i>fire trap</i> or DC 29 for the arcane version).</p>",
