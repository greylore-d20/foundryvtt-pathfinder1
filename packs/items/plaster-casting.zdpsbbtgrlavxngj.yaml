      <p>This white, dry powder mixes with water to form a paste, which hardens
      over the course of an hour to create a solid material. It can be used to
      make casts of footprints or carvings, fill in gaps or cracks in walls, or
      (if applied over a cloth wrapping) create a cast for a broken bone.
      Hardened plaster has hardness 1 and 5 hit points per inch of thickness. A
      5-pound clay pot of plaster can cover about 5 square feet of flat space to
      a depth of 1 inch, five Medium forearm or lower-leg casts, two Medium
      full-arm or full-leg casts, or twice as many casts for a Small
      creature.</p>
