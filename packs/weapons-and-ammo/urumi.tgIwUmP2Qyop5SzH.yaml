      sword, this deadly weapon is fashioned from one to four 5-foot-long,
      razor-sharp blades of flexible steel, almost like a metal cato'-
      nine-tails. The weapon is wielded by whipping the blades at one's
      opponent. The coiled blade is fine and flexible enough to be worn as a
      belt, and its wielders often carry the blades wrapped around themselves in
      this fashion.</p>
