  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, you call forth an
      illusory fiend and order it to temporarily drag a living and sentient
      creature into an afterlife of pain and misery. This otherwise acts
      identically to @Compendium[pf1.spells.6efjgs1qvmj6yxqv]{Phantasmal
      Killer}, except targets that fail their Fortitude saving throws become
      paralyzed for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 + your inquisitor level
      instead of dying.</p>
