    value: >-
      <p>You gain a brief understanding of the workings of a single puzzle,
      device, or trap, gaining an insight bonus equal to your caster level
      (maximum +10) on checks to disable, manipulate or solve the object in
      question. Your insight is ineffable; you are unable to communicate your
      understanding to others.</p><p>At the GM's option, this spell may instead
      give you a clue or other piece of useful information. In this case you may
