    value: >-
      <p>You summon a chain from another realm, causing it to burst out from the
      ground and strike a target within the spell's range. You can have the
      chain either make a melee attack (dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage)
      or attempt a trip combat maneuver against the target. The chain uses your
      base attack bonus plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier as its
      attack bonus and combat maneuver bonus. On a successful hit or combat
      maneuver check, the target must attempt a Will save. If it fails its save,
      the creature is shaken for 1d4 rounds. You summon one additional chain
      every 3 levels after 1st, for a total of two chains at 4th level, three at
      7th level, and a maximum of four at 10th level. Multiple chains can attack
      the same target but the shaken effect doesn't stack.</p>
