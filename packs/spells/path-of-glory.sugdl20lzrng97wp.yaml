  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You cause four 5-foot squares (one of which must be your space) to glow
      with dim illumination. Starting on your next turn, as a swift action you
      can extend the glowing area by an additional four 5-foot squares; each new
      square must be adjacent to a square that was previously glowing. Allies
      that end their turns on a glowing square (including one who falls
      unconscious in the square) are healed of 1 point of damage.</p>
