      "value": "<p>At 12th level, you can manifest an illusion of an ancestor’s bloody battlefield once per day. This functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.a2y1yf0a4jy3610w]{Hallucinatory Terrain}, except it can create only battlefields drawn from a civilization’s past, and the effect ends when your bloodrage ends. The saving throw to disbelieve is equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. The horrifying scene causes creatures within the area of effect to take a –2 penalty on saves versus fear effects until they disbelieve the illusion. If a creature fails the Will save to disbelieve the illusion, it gains the shaken condition until your bloodrage ends, or until it leaves the area of effect. This is an illusion (glamer) and fear effect.</p>"
