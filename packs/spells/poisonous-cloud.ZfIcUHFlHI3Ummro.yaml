  shortDescription: >-
    <p><em>Poisonous cloud</em> creates a bank of fog like that created by
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{fog cloud}, except that the vapors
    are toxic. The cloud deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage per round to
    living creatures that fail their Fortitude saves. A creature that succeeds
    at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to attempt a new saving
    throw each round on your turn.</p><p><em>Poisonous cloud</em> can be made
    permanent with a @Compendium[pf1.spells.nsxngq65mbrzgwnm]{permanency} spell
    cast by a caster of 13th level or higher, at a cost of 12,500 gp. A
    permanent <em>poisonous cloud</em> dispersed by wind re-forms in 10
    minutes.</p>
