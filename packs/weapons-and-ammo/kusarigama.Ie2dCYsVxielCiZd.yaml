  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon has a single kama or sickle held in the off hand, attached
      by 10 feet of fine chain to a weighted metal ball. The sickle can be used
      to make trip attacks, jabs, and blocks, while the ball is whipped around
      at high speeds and then smashed into the opponent, or used to tangle an
      opponent's sword or spear, allowing the wielder to then attack with the
      sickle.</p>
