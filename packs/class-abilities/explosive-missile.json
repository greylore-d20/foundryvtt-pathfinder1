He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
