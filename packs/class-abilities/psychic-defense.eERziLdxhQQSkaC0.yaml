  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Reading small, invisible cues allows the psychic to take advantage of
      social circumstances and subtly influence her target. Casting a linked
      spell during a social encounter and spending 1 point from her phrenic pool
      allows the psychic to add a +4 bonus on her next Bluff, Diplomacy,
      Intimidate, or Sense Motive check.</p>
