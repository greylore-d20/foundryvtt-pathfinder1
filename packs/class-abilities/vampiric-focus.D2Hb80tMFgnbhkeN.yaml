    value: >-
      <p>A vampire hunter knows the sinister power of the <em>undead</em>.
      Through discipline and precision, he can temporarily turn the unholy
      powers of the <em>undead</em> against them.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, the vampire hunter must select one common vampiric power
      to mimic from the vampiric foci listed below. Each vampiric focus grants
      the vampire hunter a bonus or special ability. Once this decision is made,
      the vampire hunter cannot change which vampiric focus he knows. At 8th and
      16th level, the vampire hunter learns an additional vampiric focus.</p>

      <p>As a <em>swift action</em>, the vampire hunter can <em>activate</em>
      his vampiric focus. Ending the vampiric focus is a <em>free
      action</em>.</p>

      <p>He can use each vampiric focus for a number of minutes per day equal to
      his level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be
      spent in 1-minute increments.</p>

      <p>Once the vampire hunter ends a focus, it cannot be reactivated for 1
      minute. The vampire hunter can have only one vampiric focus active at a
      time. Benefits from different vampiric foci do not stack with one another,
      including <em>temporary hit points</em> from multiple foci.</p>
