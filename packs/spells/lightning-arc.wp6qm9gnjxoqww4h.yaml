  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You generate an arc of lightning between two targets. The lightning deals
    1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to both
    targets and any creatures in a line connecting them. The spell fails if
    there is no line of effect between the targets. <i>Lightning arc</i> sets
    fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals
    that have a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or
    bronze.</p>
