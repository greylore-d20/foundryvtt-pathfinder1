This transformation functions as the <em>reincarnate</em> spell, with the newly formed <em>deep one</em> gaining the following modifications to its physical ability scores: +6\_<em>Strength</em>, –2\_<em>Dexterity</em>, and +6\_<em>Constitution</em>.</li><li><strong>Sea Longing (Ex)</strong>:\_Every 24 hours a deep one hybrid spends in an area more than 10 miles from the sea, it must succeed at a DC 20 <em>Will save</em> or take 1 point of <em>Wisdom drain</em>.</li><li><strong>Take to the Water (Ex)</strong>:\_A deep one hybrid can hold its breath 10 times longer than a <em>human</em> can, and gains a +2 bonus on <em>Initiative</em> checks and <em>Reflex </em>saving throws while swimming.
