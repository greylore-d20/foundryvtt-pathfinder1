    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can unleash a scorching bolt of divine fire
      from your outstretched hand. You can target any single foe within 30 feet
      as a ranged touch attack with this bolt of fire. If you hit the foe, the
      fire bolt deals 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every two cleric
      levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day
      equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
