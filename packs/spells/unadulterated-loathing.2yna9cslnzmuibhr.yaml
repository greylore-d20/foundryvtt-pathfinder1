      <p>You fill the target with a terrible loathing aimed at a specific
      creature. At the time of the casting, you designate a single creature as
      the object of the target's revulsion. Thereafter, the target does all it
      can to remain at least 60 feet away from the object of its loathing. As
      soon as the target moves within this range, it becomes nauseated until it
      can again get away from the object of its revulsion. If traveling beyond
      60 feet of the object of its loathing would place the target in obvious
      physical danger, the target can attempt a second save to break the spell's
      effect.</p><p><i>Unadulterated loathing</i> counters <i>reckless
