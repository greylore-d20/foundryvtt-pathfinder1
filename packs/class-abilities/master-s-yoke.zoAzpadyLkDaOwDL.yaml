  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can attempt to assert your dominance over any visible
      creature within 30 feet by declaring the target your property. The target
      can resist this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + half your
      class level + your Wisdom modifier). If the target fails the save, it is
      affected as if by dominate monster for a number of rounds equal to half
      your class level. The target can choose to ignore any order you give and
      instead take 2 points of Constitution damage and become staggered for 1
      round. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an
      additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 8th. This is a
      language-based mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Staff of Order power of the Law Domain.</p>
