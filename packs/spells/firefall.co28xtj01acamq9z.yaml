      <p><i>Firefall</i> causes a fire to erupt into a geyser of dazzlingly
      bright liquid flame. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately
      extinguished. A fire larger than a 20-foot cube is only partly
      extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, but a creature of the
      fire subtype used as the source takes 1 point of damage per caster level
      (no saving throw).</p><p>The coruscating rain of fire fills a
      hemispherical burst with a radius of 60 feet. All creatures and objects in
      the area take 5d6 points of fire damage and catch on fire (<i>Core
      Rulebook</i> 444).</p><p>Creatures who make successful Reflex saves take
      half damage and don't catch on fire. Creatures within 120 feet of the
      original fire source are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).</p>
