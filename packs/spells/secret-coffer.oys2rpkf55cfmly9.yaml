  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>secret chest</i>, except the coffer is
      only 1 foot square and can contain only 1 cubic foot of goods, and the
      container can remain safely hidden on the Ethereal Plane for only 14 days
      before it risks becoming lost. The spell automatically fails if a living
      creature enters the coffer. The coffer used as a focus for <i>secret
      coffer</i> must cost at least 500 gp, and its replica costs 5 gp.</p>
