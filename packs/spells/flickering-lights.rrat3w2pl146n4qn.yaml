      <p>You cause the illumination in the area to seem to flicker erratically,
      fluctuating between absolute darkness and blinding brightness. The level
      of light in the area changes at the start of each creature's turn, as
      determined by rolling a percentile die and consulting the following table.
      </p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>d%</th><th>Illumination
      level</th></tr><tr><td>1-10</td><td>Supernatural
      darkness</td></tr><tr><td>11-25</td><td>Darkness</td></tr><tr><td>26-50</td><td>Dim
      light</td></tr><tr><td>51-90</td><td>Normal
      light</td></tr><tr><td>91-00</td><td>Bright
      light</td></tr></tbody></table> Even darkvision can't see through
      supernatural darkness (as <i>deeper</i> darkness). Bright light affects
      creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity. For the purpose of
      superseding its effects with higher-level light or darkness spells,
      <i>flickering lights</i> counts as a light spell when it increases the
      ambient light level and a darkness spell when it decreases the ambient
      light level.<p></p>
