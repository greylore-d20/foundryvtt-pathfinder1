  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At almost 5 feet in height, a longbow is made up of one solid piece of
      carefully curved wood. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its
      size. A longbow can't be used while mounted. If you have a penalty for low
      Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. You can apply
      your Strength modifier to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow,
      but not a regular longbow. A longbow fires arrows.</p>
