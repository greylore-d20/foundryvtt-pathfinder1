      "value": "<p>Fire’s hunger and water’s flow grant you swiftness and elegance, and you move with breathtaking purpose and grace. You can increase your base speed by 10 feet.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, while using this ability, you can use Acrobatics to move at full speed through threatened squares or other creatures’ squares without increasing the DC by 10.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, while using this ability, you can walk on liquid as if using&nbsp;water walk, and you are immune to damage caused by proximity to (but not immersion in) lava, magma, and similarly heated stone.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.</p>\n<p>Oracles with the lame oracle curse cannot select this revelation.</p>"
