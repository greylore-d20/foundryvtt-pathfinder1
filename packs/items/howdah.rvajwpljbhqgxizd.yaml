      <p>This wooden platform is tied like a <em>saddle</em> to a Huge
      creature's back. The platform is 10 feet square and enclosed by a low wall
      and sometimes a roof. The howdah has room for four Medium creatures
      (usually armed with bows or longspears), or two Medium creatures and a
      light ballista or light catapult. Occupants of the howdah have
      <em>cover</em> against attackers from below and are considered mounted for
      the purposes of making attacks.</p>
