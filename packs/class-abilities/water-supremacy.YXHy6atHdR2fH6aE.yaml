  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Swim skill checks. This bonus
      increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you
      can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your
      Constitution score before you must start making checks to avoid drowning.
      At 10th level, you gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. At 20th
      level, whenever you make a Swim skill check, assume the roll resulted in a
      natural 20.</p>
