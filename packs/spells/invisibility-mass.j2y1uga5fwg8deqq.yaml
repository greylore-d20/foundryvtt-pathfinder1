      <p>This spell functions like <i>invisibility,</i> except that the effect
      moves with the group and is broken when anyone in the group
      attacks.</p><p>Individuals in the group cannot see each other. The spell
      is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest
      member of the group. If only two individuals are affected, the one moving
      away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away
      from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them
      exceeds 180 feet.</p>
