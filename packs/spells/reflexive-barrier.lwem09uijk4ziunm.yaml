    value: >-
      <p>In the blink of an eye, you erect a deflective barrier of force to
      protect one target. The target gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to
      half your caster level. This bonus lasts until the beginning of your next
      turn. You can cast this spell as a reaction to an attack, but you must do
      so before the result of the attack is revealed.</p>
