  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell has two versions.</p><p><i>Prune Growth</i>: This version of
      the spell causes normal vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet
      per level) to shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled
      and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully
      pruned and trimmed. This version of <i>diminish plants</i> automatically
      dispels any spells or effects that enhance plants, such as
      <i>entangle</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, and <i>Wall of Thorns</i>.</p><p>At
      your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius
      semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle. You may also designate
      portions of the area that are not affected.</p><p><i>Stunt Growth</i>:
      This version of the spell targets all normal plants within a range of 1/2
      mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the
      following year to half normal.</p><p>This spell has no effect on plant
      creatures.</p>
