      affecting creatures within. The spell affects a total number of HD of
      creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20).</p><p>Creatures with
      the fewest HD are affected first, and among creatures with equal HD, those
      who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that
      are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each
      subject according to its HD.</p><p><i>6 or less</i>: Unconscious for 1d4
      rounds, then stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then <i>confused</i> for 1d4
      rounds. (Treat an unconscious result as stunned for nonliving creatures.)

      additional 1d4 rounds.</p><p>13 or more: Confused for 1d4
