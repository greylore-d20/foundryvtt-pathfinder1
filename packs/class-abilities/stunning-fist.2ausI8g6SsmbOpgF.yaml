      <p>At 1st level, the monk gains
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.GsjouI6B8X7BA5wN]{Stunning Fist} as a
      bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.</p><p>At 4th
      level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply
      a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition
      replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw
      still negates the effect.</p><h4>Condition Options</h4><ul><li><p>At 4th
      level, he can choose to make the target fatigued.</p></li><li><p>At 8th
      level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute.</p></li><li><p>At
      12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1
      rounds.</p></li><li><p>At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen
      the target.</p></li><li><p>At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for
      1d6+1 rounds.</p></li></ul><p>The monk must choose which condition will
      apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with
      themselves (a creature sickened by <em>Stunning Fist</em> cannot become
      nauseated if hit by <em>Stunning Fist</em> again), but additional hits do
      increase the duration.</p>
