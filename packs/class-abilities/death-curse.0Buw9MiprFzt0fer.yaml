    value: >-
      <p>This powerful hex seizes a creature's heart, causing death within just
      a few moments. This hex has a range of 30 feet. The hexed creature
      receives a Will save to negate the effect.</p><p>If this save is failed,
      the creature becomes fatigued the first round of the hex.</p><p>On the
      second round of the hex, the creature becomes exhausted.</p><p>On the
      third round, the creature dies unless it succeeds at a Fort
      save.</p><p>Creatures that fail the first save but succeed at the second
      remain exhausted and take 4d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per
      level of the witch.</p><p>Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends
      the effect, but any fatigue or exhaustion remains.</p><p>Whether or not
      the saves are successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex
      again for 1 day.</p>
