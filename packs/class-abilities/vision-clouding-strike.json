A creature struck with the weapon must succeed at a Will save (DC = 1/2 the magus’s level + his Intelligence modifier) or treat the magus as being in an area of dim light for 1d4 rounds, plus 1 additional round for each arcane pool point expended.&nbsp;True seeing&nbsp;penetrates this effect, but darkvision and similar darkness-penetrating effects do not.</p>\n<p>The magus must be at least 9th level before selecting this arcana.</p>"
