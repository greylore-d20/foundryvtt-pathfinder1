  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An evolution of the punching dagger, the pata is a short sword that
      ends in a full, fingerless gauntlet hilt. You punch rather than stab with
      the weapon, allowing you to put more force behind each strike. While
      wearing a pata, you cannot use that hand for anything else. A pata
      provides a +10 bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts.</p>
