This attack targets the foe’s touch AC, and the foe is denied her Dexterity bonus against the attack. Once a foe has been the target of perfect vulnerability, she can’t be the target of the same vigilante’s perfect vulnerability for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>A vigilante must be at least 8th level to select this talent.</p>"
