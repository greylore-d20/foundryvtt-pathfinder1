  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You wrap your mind in phantasms of crippling doubt that assail any who
    dare harm you. When a creature within the mantle's radius attacks you or
    attempts to affect you with a harmful effect, it must succeed at a Will save
    as these spectres of uncertainty force themselves into its mind. Ongoing
    effects trigger the mantle only if the creature consciously directs them
    against you. A given creature need only roll a saving throw against your
    <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> at most once per round. If the creature's attack or
    effect against you was a psychic spell or spell-like ability, that
    creature's save takes a -4 penalty. A creatures that fails its save against
    your <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> is affected for 1d4+1 rounds, during which time
    it is shaken, cannot flank, and no longer threatens creatures within its
    reach. In addition, it takes a -2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting
    effects, which stacks with the penalties for being shaken. If your <i>Mantle
    of Doubt</i> affects a creature that is already shaken, that creature's fear
    level doesn't increase. Instead, mounting doubts stagger the creature for 1
    round and deal 1d4 points of Wisdom and Charisma damage to it.  Spell
    resistance applies against assaults from a <i>Mantle of Doubt</i>, and
    immunity to fear or mind-affecting effects negates the spell's effects. If
    you are immune to fear or mind-affecting effects, you can still cast
    <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> on yourself.</p>
