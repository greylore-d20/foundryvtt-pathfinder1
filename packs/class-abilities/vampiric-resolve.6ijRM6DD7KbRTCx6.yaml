  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vampire hunter gains a +2 bonus on <em>Will</em> saving throws
      against <em>mind-affecting</em> effects. If he has already been affected
      by a <em>mind-affecting</em> effect when he activates this focus, he can
      immediately reroll his saving throw against that effect with a bonus equal
      to half his vampire hunter level. At 16th level, he is immune to
      mindaffecting effects.</p>
