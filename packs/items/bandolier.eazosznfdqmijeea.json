It has small loops or pouches for holding eight objects the size of a flask or small dagger. You can use the &#8220;retrieve a stored item&#8221; action to take an item from a bandolier. You can wear up to two bandoliers at the same time (any more than this and they get in each other's way and restrict your movement).</p>"
