  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vampire hunter gains a bonus on <em>Perception</em> and
      <em>Stealth</em> checks equal to half his level. At 8th level, he can move
      at his normal <em>speed</em> while using <em>Stealth</em> with no penalty.
      At 16th level, the vampire hunter can use <em>Stealth</em> while charging
      (but not while making any other attack); when charging (and only when
      charging), he can attempt a <em>Stealth</em> check even if he lacks
      <em>cover</em> relative to his target.</p>
