      <p>This spell functions as <i>mirror hideaway</i>, except any creature
      that enters the target mirror can spend a swift action to exit through
      another mirror within 500 feet as if using <i>dimension door</i>; this is
      a one-way transport. The creature can exit through a mirror only if it
      could fit through an opening the same size as the mirror. Each transport
      through the target mirror reduces the spell's duration by 1 hour.</p>
