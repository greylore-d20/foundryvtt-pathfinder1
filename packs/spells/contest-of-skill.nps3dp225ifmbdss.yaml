  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The randomness of critical hits has long vexed certain duelists in the
    Aldori school who consider luck to be an unwelcome addition to duels, which
    they view as contests of skill rather than chance. The creature targeted by
    this spell is infused with magical power, altering the odds of combat to
    weaken lucky strikes. Critical threats made by the affected creature
    automatically fail to confirm. Critical threats that automatically confirm
    due to class features or feats, such as the fighter's weapon mastery, are
    unaffected by this spell. In addition, when the initial target of this spell
    fails its Will save to resist <i>Contest of Skill</i>, it can select one
    additional creature within range of the spell to suffer the effects of the
    spell as well (Will negates). If this secondary target negates this spell
    with a successful save, the duration of <i>Contest of Skill</i> on the
    primary target is reduced to 1 round.</p>
