  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a move action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from his arcane
      reservoir to cause his eyes to turn red and weep tears of blood. During
      this time, the arcanist’s vision is blurred by blood, and he treats all
      gaze attacks as if he were averting his eyes from a creature, but that
      creature does not gain concealment against him. At a distance of greater
      than 30 feet, all creatures or objects viewed by the arcanist gain
      concealment. As a standard action that ends the blood tears exploit, the
      arcanist can wipe the tears from his face and flick them with a free hand,
      splattering all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in this area must
      succeed at a Will save to avoid becoming staggered with extreme pain and
      anguish for 1 round. If the arcanist doesn’t wipe his bleeding tears away,
      the effects of this exploit can persist for a maximum duration of 1 minute
      per arcanist level.</p>
