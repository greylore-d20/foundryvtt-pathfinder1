If she succeeds, she takes no damage from the attack. If she fails, she takes half damage from the attack and the damage is nonlethal. The barbarian must elect to use this ability after the attack roll is made, but before the damage is rolled.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>"
