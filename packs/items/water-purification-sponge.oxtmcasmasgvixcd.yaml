      <p>This fist-sized blue sponge absorbs up to 1 pint of water; squeezing
      the water out of the sponge filters and purifies it, making it safe for
      drinking, washing, and similar activities. Filling and emptying the sponge
      is a full-round action. The filtration is enough to remove mundane
      impurities and common diseases, but does nothing to protect against
      poisons, magic, and other exotic threats. Each sponge can cleanse 25 pints
      of water before deteriorating and becoming useless.</p>
