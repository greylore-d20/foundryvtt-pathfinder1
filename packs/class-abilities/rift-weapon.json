Once per day as a standard action, you can touch one weapon (or a group of up to 20 similar pieces of ammunition) and give it the ability to penetrate DR/cold iron for 1 minute per caster level.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can also grant the additional ability to bypass either DR/good and DR/law.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability an additional time per day for every 5 oracle levels you possess.</p>"
