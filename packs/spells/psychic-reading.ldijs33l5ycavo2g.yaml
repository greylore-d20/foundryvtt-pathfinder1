    value: >-
      <p>You are able to read a person's surface thoughts and take cues from the
      person's appearance, body language, and manner of speech to infer a great
      deal of information about the person, even if that person is in disguise
      (including polymorph effects). When casting the spell, attempt a DC 20
      Sense Motive check with a bonus equal to your caster level. A successful
      skill check reveals to you one of the following pieces of information of
      your choice, plus one additional piece of information for every 5 points
      by which your check result exceeds 20: age, alignment, class†, feats†,
      gender, native language, place of origin, race or ethnicity, racial
      traits†, religion, sexual orientation, or training in a Craft, Perform, or
      Profession skill. For items marked with a cross (†), if the target has
      more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as a piece
      of information.  There's a 70% chance that all information you receive is
      correct. This roll is made secretly. Otherwise, on a roll of 71-80, you
      receive one false piece of information, on a roll of 81-90 you receive
      two, and on a roll of 91-100 you receive three. You can't get more false
      information than the total number of pieces of information you
      discover.</p>
