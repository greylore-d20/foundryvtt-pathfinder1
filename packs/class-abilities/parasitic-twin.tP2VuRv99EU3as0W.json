      "value": "<p>The alchemist’s vestigial limbs are part of a parasitic twin on his torso, consisting of a head, a torso, and two arms (from the vestigial limb discovery). Normally, the twin is mostly recessed within the alchemist’s body, with the visible arms acting like the vestigial arm discovery, though the alchemist can manifest or hide the twin as a standard action. The twin is helpless, fully subservient to the alchemist, and cannot be targeted or harmed. Once per day, if the alchemist succumbs to a mental effect that would make him unconscious, helpless, or not in control of his own actions (such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.tjog6bufg5b08lvq]{Charm Person}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.66vvhyiy5q8yzbq2]{Feeblemind}, or @Compendium[pf1.spells.78kwl5t99j9e8tzh]{Hold Person}), he can reroll his saving throw; success means the twin absorbs the effect and the alchemist can ignore it. Using this ability sickens the alchemist for the duration of the absorbed effect (removing the effect from the twin ends the sickened condition), and he cannot use the twin’s limbs during that time, though passive effects (such as from rings worn on the vestigial limbs) continue normally.</p>\n<p>The alchemist must have selected the vestigial arm discovery twice before selecting this discovery.</p>"
