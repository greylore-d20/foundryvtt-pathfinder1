  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day as a standard action, you can cause the weapons around you
      to shatter in their wielders’ hands. When you use this ability, attempt a
      single sunder combat maneuver, using your caster level in place of your
      base attack bonus and your Charisma modifier in place of Strength. Every
      creature except you in a 10-foot radius that is wielding a manufactured
      weapon is targeted by the same attempt. You deal an amount of damage to
      each weapon affected equal to 1d4 × your Charisma modifier (minimum 1d4).
      At 11th level, this damage increases to 1d6 × your Charisma modifier
      (minimum 1d6).</p>

      <p>At 10th level, you can use this ability twice per day.</p>
