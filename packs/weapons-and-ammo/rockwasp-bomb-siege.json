The alchemical wax keeps the wasps immobilized, while tiny air holes allow them to breath.</p>\n<p>This ammunition <strong>deals only half damage</strong>, but releases a wasp swarm-two wasp swarms if used for a heavy catapult or heavy trebuchet. The wasps attack for 1 minute before dispersing.</p>\n<h3>Mishap</h3>\n<p>On a siege engine mishap, the wasps escape before the ammunition is launched.</p>"
