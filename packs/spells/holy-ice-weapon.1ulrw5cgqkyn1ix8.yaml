    value: >-
      <p>You create a masterwork weapon that has the qualities of ice and holy
      water. This weapon must be a simple weapon or your deity's favored weapon.
      The weapon deals normal damage for a weapon of that type, plus 1 point of
      cold damage per caster level (maximum 10). In addition, any creature
      struck by the weapon is also hit by holy water, dealing 1d4 points of
      damage if the creature is susceptible to holy water. If the weapon leaves
      your hands for more than 1 round, it melts and the spell ends.</p><p>At
      caster level 6th, the weapon gains the <i>returning</i> weapon special
      ability when thrown, melting away after an attack and re-forming in your
      hand just before your next turn.</p>
