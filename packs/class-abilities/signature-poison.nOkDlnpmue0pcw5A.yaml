      <p>A character with this talent chooses one poison (such as bloodroot or
      oil of taggit) as her signature poison. When she uses the chosen poison,
      the poisonâ€™s saving throw DC increases by +2. A character can take this
      talent multiple times, each time applying it to a new poison.</p>
