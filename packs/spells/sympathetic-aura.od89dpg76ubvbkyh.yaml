      <p>This spell functions like <i>magic aura</i>, except it extends its
      altered aura to similar items in a 5-foot radius. For this purpose,
      similar items must be alike in approximate shape, composition, and
      function, so a <i>potion of cure light wounds</i> targeted by this spell
      to appear nonmagical would also obscure the auras of nearby potions,
      elixirs, and oils, as well as flasks. Items other than the targeted item
      retain their altered aura for 1 round per caster level after being removed
      from the spell's area.</p>
