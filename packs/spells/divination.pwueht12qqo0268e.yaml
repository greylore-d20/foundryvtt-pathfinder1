      <p>Similar to <i>augury</i> but more powerful, a <i>divination</i> spell
      can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question
      concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1
      week. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase,
      or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party
      doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the
      information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct
      <i>divination</i> is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If
      the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic
      yielding false information is at work.</p><p>As with <i>augury</i>,
      multiple <i>divinations</i> about the same topic by the same caster use
      the same dice result as the first <i>divination</i> spell and yield the
      same answer each time.</p>
