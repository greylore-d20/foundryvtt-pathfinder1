    value: >-
      <p>You heighten your awareness of your own thoughts, allowing you to more
      easily resist outside influences. You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving
      throws to resist mind-affecting effects. This resistance bonus is
      increased to +2 if the effect is an emotion or fear effect. Additionally,
      at any time during the spell's duration, whenever you fail a saving throw
      to resist a mind-affecting effect, you can expend the spell's remaining
      duration as an immediate action in order to reroll that saving throw. You
      must take the second result, even if it's worse. The +2 resistance bonus
      granted by the spell applies to the reroll, but after you make this
      reroll, the spell ends.</p>
