      S</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Popular in Egorian but rarely seen elsewhere,
      a barbazu beard is an intimidating helm with a full facemask wrought to
      look like a snarling barbazu's head. Extending from the chin area of the
      face guard is a razor-sharp blade much like an actual barbazu's beard,
      usually 8 inches long but sometimes longer. A barbazu beard can be used as
      an off-hand weapon that requires no hands to use; thus, a warrior could
      combine use of a barbazu beard with a two-handed weapon. It otherwise
      follows all rules for using an off-hand weapon. Attacking with a barbazu
      beard provokes an attack of opportunity. Because it is so close to the
      wearer's face, using a barbazu beard against creatures harmful to touch
      (such as fire elementals and acidic oozes) has the same risks as using a
      natural weapon or unarmed strike against these creatures.</p><p>A barbazu
      beard is a light melee exotic weapon.</p>
