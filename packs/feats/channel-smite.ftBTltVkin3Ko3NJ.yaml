      <p><em>You can channel your divine energy through a melee weapon you
      wield.</em><p><b>Prerequisites</b><br>Channel energy class
      feature.<p><b>Benefits</b><br>Before you make a melee attack roll, you can
      choose to spend one use of your channel energy ability as a swift action.
      If you channel positive energy and you hit an undead creature, that
      creature takes an amount of additional damage equal to the damage dealt by
      your channel positive energy ability. If you channel negative energy and
      you hit a living creature, that creature takes an amount of additional
      damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel negative energy ability.
      Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this additional
      damage. If your attack misses, the channel energy ability is still
      expended with no effect.<p><b>Combat Trick</b><br>When making an attack
      using this feat, you can spend a number of stamina points up to the number
      of dice in your channel energy. For each stamina point you spend in this
      way, add an additional 1d6 points of positive or negative energy damage to
      your Channel Smite attack. This damage is also halved if the target
      succeeds at its Will save against the Channel Smite attack.</p>
