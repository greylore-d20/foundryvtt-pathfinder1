  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You curse a creature so one set of its limbs (typically its arms, legs,
    or wings) shrivels in size. <i>Arms</i>: The creature counts as one size
    category smaller for the purpose of determining the size of weapon it can
    wield. If the creature is capable of making natural attacks with its arms,
    the damage dealt by those attacks decreases as though the target were one
    size category smaller than its actual size.</p>
