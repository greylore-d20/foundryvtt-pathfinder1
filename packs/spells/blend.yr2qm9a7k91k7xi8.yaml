  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You draw upon your elven link to the wilderness to change the
      coloration of yourself and your equipment to match that of your
      surroundings. This grants you a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks
      and allows you to make Stealth checks without cover or concealment, but
      only while you move no more than half your base speed or less. If you move
      more than half your base speed on your turn, you gain no benefit from this
      spell until the start of your next turn. If you make an attack, this spell
      ends (as invisibility).</p>
