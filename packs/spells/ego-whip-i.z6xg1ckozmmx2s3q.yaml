      <p>You can use your psychic power to overwhelm the target's ego, leaving
      the target feeling hopeless and unsure of itself. Choose Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma. The target takes a -2 penalty to that ability score,
      and is also staggered for the first round it's affected. A successful Will
      save negates the staggered effect and reduces the duration of the penalty
      to 1 round.</p>
