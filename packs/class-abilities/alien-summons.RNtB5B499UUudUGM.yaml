  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the shaman calls or summons one or more creatures, one
      creature of her choice arrives with the advanced creature simple template.
      The creature presents a distorted mockery of the usual creature summoned,
      its body deformed and alien in nature. This chosen creatureâ€™s anatomy is
      so confounding that it is immune to the additional damage from critical
      hits or precision damage (such as that granted by sneak attack).</p>
