    value: >-
      <p>As an immediate action, you can gain a +2 bonus on a Will saving throw
      you are about to attempt. This bonus increases to +4 against an
      enchantment spell or effect. Any ally who attempts a saving throw against
      the same effect gains a +1 bonus on the Will save, or a +2 bonus if the
      effect is an enchantment. If you succeed at the saving throw, you regain 1
      point in your phrenic pool.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
