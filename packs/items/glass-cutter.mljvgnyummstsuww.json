You score the glass with the wheel and tap it with the bulb to break it. If you succeed at a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check, you can break the glass very quietly (DC 15 <em>Perception</em> check to hear). Most thieves use <em>glue paper</em> with a <em>glass cutter</em> to reduce noise and capture glass fragments.</p>"
