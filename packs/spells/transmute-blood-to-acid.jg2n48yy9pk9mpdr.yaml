    value: >-
      <p>You transmute blood in the target's body to acid, dealing 1d6 points of
      acid damage/2 levels (maximum 12d6) each round.</p><p>The creature is
      staggered and sickened by the debilitating pain. A successful Fortitude
      save each round halves the damage and negates the staggered condition for
      1 round. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it
      dissolves, leaving only the barest trace of remains. A dissolved
      creature's equipment is unaffected.</p><p>Anyone who strikes the target
      with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6
      points of acid damage as the acidic blood sprays on the attacker. If the
      attack is from a piercing or slashing manufactured weapon, the weapon also
      takes this damage.</p><p>This spell has no effect on creatures immune to
      critical hits or bleed effects.</p>
