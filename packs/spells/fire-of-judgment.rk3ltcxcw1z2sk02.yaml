  shortDescription: >-
    <p>After casting this spell, the next creature you attack using your smite
    evil class ability is engulfed in flames of positive energy. At the start of
    its turn, the target takes 1d6 points of damage, and takes an additional 1d6
    points of damage each time it attacks a creature other than you. If the
    creature is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an
    undead creature this damage increases to 1d10. With a successful saving
    throw, a creature is affected by this spell for only 1 round. This damage is
    divine in nature and bypasses any DR the creature possesses.</p>
