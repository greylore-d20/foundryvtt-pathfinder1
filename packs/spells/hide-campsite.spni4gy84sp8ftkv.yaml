    value: >-
      <p>You make the area around a campsite appear to be a thicket of untouched
      and forbidding foliage, or some other unwelcoming feature matching the
      surrounding terrain. Creatures outside the area cannot sense any activity
      going on inside the area- they cannot smell campfires or cooking food,
      they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they
      cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those inside
      the area can see out normally. Once a creature steps into the area of the
      spell, it can see everything in and around the area normally.</p>
