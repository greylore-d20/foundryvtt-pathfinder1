      "value": "<p>You gain Deific Obedience (Pathfinder Campaign Setting Inner Sea Gods 210) as a bonus feat, even if you don’t meet its prerequisites. When you gain the feat, choose one Godclaw deity; you can perform that deity’s daily obedience to gain its benefits. Whenever you would gain one of your deity’s boons, you can instead gain the benefits of another Godclaw deity’s obedience. You can choose to gain the benefits of a maximum of four Godclaw deities’ obediences if you choose to forgo all three of your god’s boons. You never need to spend more than 1 hour per day to perform your obedience.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>"
