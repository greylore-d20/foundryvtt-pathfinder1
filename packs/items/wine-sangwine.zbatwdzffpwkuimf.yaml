      <h4>Wine, Sangwine</h4>

      <p class="source"><b>Source</b> <em>PPC:MM</em></p>

      <p><b>Price</b> 200 gp; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>

      <p>This deep red wine is highly tannic and has notes of currants and cocoa
      and an aroma of cedar.</p>

      <p>Sangwine is a favorite of the elite, who associate drinking it with
      long life.</p>

      <p>Drinking a glass of sangwine takes at least 1 round, though many
      imbibers take longer to savor the <em>wine's</em> complex flavors. After
      drinking a glass, the wine gives the drinker's blood a bitter flavor for 1
      hour, causing any creature that deals damage using the <em>blood
      drain</em> extraordinary ability to become <em>sickened</em> for a number
      of rounds equal to the points of <em>Constitution damage</em> dealt (this
      effect is not subject to the poison immunity of <em>vampires</em> and
      other <em>undead</em>). Repeated uses of the <em>blood drain</em> ability
      on a creature that has imbibed at least one glass of sangwine extends the
      duration of the <em>sickened</em> condition.</p>

      <p>The price listed is for a <em>bottle</em>, which contains six glasses'
      worth of sangwine.</p>
