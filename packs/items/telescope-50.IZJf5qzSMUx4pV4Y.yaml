    value: >-
      <p>This basic, semi-portable telescope allows the user to see greater
      detail on very distant objects. Telescopes can be built to a variety of
      specifications, but those most often used by adventuring stargazers are
      listed here. A telescope grants the listed <em>circumstance bonus</em>
      (+2, +4, or +6) on <em>Perception</em> checks (see table below) to discern
      celestial bodies and on <em>Knowledge</em> (geography) checks to learn
      about the planets when used at night.</p><p>A telescope can be used to
      look at either terrestrial or celestial objects. Distance penalties on
      <em>Perception</em> checks for viewing objects through the telescope are
      divided by the telescope's magnification. Assembling, disassembling, or
      significantly moving a telescope takes 1
      minute.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Magnification</th><th>Circumstance
