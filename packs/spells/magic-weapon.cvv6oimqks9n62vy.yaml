      <p><i>Magic weapon</i> gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and
      damage rolls. An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork
      weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.</p><p>You can't cast this spell on a
      natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see magic fang). A
      monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced
      by this spell.</p>
