      <p>At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and grant it a blessing of
      stormy weather. For 1 minute, this weapon glows with blue or yellow sparks
      and deals an additional 1d4 points of electricity damage with each
      hit.</p>

      <p>This additional damage doesnâ€™t stack with the additional damage from
      the shock or shocking burst weapon special abilities.</p>
