    value: >-
      <p>You create a coating of slime on your hand. When you make a successful
      melee touch attack with the slime, it pulls free of you and sticks to the
      target, at which point it acts like green slime (<i>Core Rulebook</i>
      416), dealing 1d3 points of Constitution damage per round. Anything that
      destroys green slime (scraping, freezing, burning, cutting, sunlight, or
      <i>remove</i> disease) destroys this slime. If the slime kills a creature,
      it consumes the body and then dies. It cannot transfer to a creature other
      than the original target, and dies if separated from the original
      target.</p>
