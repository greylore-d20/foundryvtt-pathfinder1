  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You strap a heavy steel shield to your forearm and grip it with your
      hand. A heavy steel shield is so heavy that you canâ€™t use your shield hand
      for anything else. Whether wooden or steel, a heavy shield offers the same
      basic protection and attack benefits, though the two versions respond
      differently to some spells and effects (such as rusting grasp). A druid
      can use a heavy wooden shield, but not a heavy steel shield.</p>
