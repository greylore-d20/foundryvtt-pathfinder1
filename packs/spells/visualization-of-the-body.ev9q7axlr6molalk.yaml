  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You focus your mind on one aspect of your body, aligning the energies
    within your body to enhance that element. Choose a single physical ability
    score (Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength). If you choose Strength or
    Dexterity, you gain a +5 bonus on skill checks associated with that ability
    score. If you choose Constitution, your maximum and current hit points
    increase by an amount equal to your Hit Dice.  At any time during the
    spell's duration, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as an
    immediate action in order to gain a one-time physical enhancement associated
    with the  ability score you chose to visualize, as detailed below. After you
    do so, the spell ends. <br><b>Constitution</b>: You immediately regain a
    number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your total character level.
    <br><b>Dexterity</b>: You gain a +4 dodge bonus to your Armor Class for 3
    rounds. <br><b>Strength</b>: You gain a +6 bonus on all Strength checks to
    break objects and on checks to escape or establish grapples for 1
    minute.</p>
