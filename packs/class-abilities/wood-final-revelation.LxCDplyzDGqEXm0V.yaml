    value: >-
      <p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate Magic pg. 57</p><p>Upon reaching 20th
      level, you become a living creature of wood. You are forevermore treated
      as the plant type rather than your original type for the purpose of spells
      and magical effects. Your skin takes on the appearance of polished wood
      grain, and you gain a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and
      damage reduction 10/â€” against wooden weapons or any natural attacks made
      by a wooden or woodlike creature. You gain immunity to paralysis, poison,
      polymorph, sleep, and stunning. At will, you can meld with any tree or
      single block of wood (as meld into stone, except wood only, and with no
      limit to how long you can remain in the wood).</p>
