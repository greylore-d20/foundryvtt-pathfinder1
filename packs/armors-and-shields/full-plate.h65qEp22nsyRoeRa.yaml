    value: >-
      <p>This metal suit comprises multiple pieces of interconnected and
      overlaying metal plates, incorporating the benefits of numerous types of
      lesser armor. A complete suit of full plate (or platemail, as it is often
      called) includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a
      thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of
      full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master
      armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at
      a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 x 100) gold pieces.</p>
