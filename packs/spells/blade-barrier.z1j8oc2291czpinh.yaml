      <p>An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force
      springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6
      points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for
      half damage.</p><p>If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where
      creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the
      wall.</p><p>Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side
      of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex
      save.</p><p>A <i>blade barrier</i> provides cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2
      bonus on Reflex saves) against attacks made through it.</p>
