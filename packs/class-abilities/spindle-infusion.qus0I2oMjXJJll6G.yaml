      Reflex negates (see text)</p>

      <p>You throw a long, roughly 5-foot-by-10-foot spindle of elemental matter
      or energy (or nearby unattended objects in the case of telekineticists) up
      to 30 feet away, damaging all creatures and objects within any two
      adjacent 5-foot squares unless they succeed at a Reflex save.</p>

      <p>An energy blast infused with spindle deals its normal damage to each
      target, while a physical blast infused with spindle deals half its normal
      damage to each target. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p>
