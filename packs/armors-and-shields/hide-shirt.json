      "value": "<p>Made from animal hide and giant lizard scales over a shirt of interwoven cords, these chest and shoulder coverings protect Shoanti riders without restricting their mobility. The wearer of a hide shirt can make a DC 15 Strength check as a standard action. If he succeeds, the armor gains the broken condition and drops to the ground rather than requiring the usual 1 minute it would take to remove it. The armor must be repaired as though it had taken 8 points of damage before it can be used again; a broken hide shirt grants no bonus to Armor Class.</p>"
