  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you
      about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch
      deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If
      used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats
      approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It
      floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a
      rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise
      directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and
      you.</p><p>The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration
      expires.</p><p>The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try
      to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath
      it.</p><p>When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the
      surface beneath it.</p>
