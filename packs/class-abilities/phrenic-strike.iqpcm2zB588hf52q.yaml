  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As long as the psychic has at least 1 point in her phrenic pool, she
      can attempt an unarmed strike in place of a touch attack as part of
      casting a spell with a range of touch. This unarmed attack still provokes
      attacks of opportunity as normal unless the psychic can otherwise make
      unarmed attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>
