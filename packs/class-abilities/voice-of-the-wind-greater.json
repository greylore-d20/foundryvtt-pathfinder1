You can send messages at a much greater distance than before and at a faster rate. When using voice of the windâ€™s whispering wind effect, you can choose to have the wind rise high into the sky, where it can gust at 50 miles per hour before descending to deliver the message. While the gust is still small, abnormal wind that fast is noticeable, unlike the normal gentle zephyr from whispering wind. If you choose to use the faster gust, you can deliver a message as far as 50 miles per kineticist level, instead of 1 mile per kineticist level.</p>"
