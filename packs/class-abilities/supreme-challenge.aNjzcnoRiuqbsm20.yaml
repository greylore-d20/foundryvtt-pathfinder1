  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a charge attack while
      mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a
      lance). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on a charge
      attack while mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save
      reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the
      cavalier’s base attack bonus.</p>
