  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>enervation</i>, except that the creature
    struck gains 2d4 temporary negative levels. Twenty-four hours after gaining
    them, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = <i>energy
    drain</i> spell's save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds,
    that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes
    permanent.</p><p>An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4x5 temporary
    hit points for 1 hour.</p>
