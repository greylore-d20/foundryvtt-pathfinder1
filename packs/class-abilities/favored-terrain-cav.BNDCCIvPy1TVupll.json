He gains this as a favored terrain, as the ranger class feature of the same name. At 8th level and every 6 levels thereafter, he selects another favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.</p>"
