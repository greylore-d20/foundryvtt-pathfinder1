  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can expend an attack of opportunity to perform an aid another
      action to assist an adjacent allyâ€™s Acrobatics check, so long as he makes
      the check as part of movement that passes through your space or an
      adjacent space. Additionally, whenever you use the aid another action to
      assist an ally in making an Acrobatics check and you succeed, your ally
      gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when he
      moves out of or within a threatened area, until the end of his turn.</p>
