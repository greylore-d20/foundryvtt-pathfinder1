    value: >-
      <p>You cause a creature's arm to waver and prevent it from striking
      another creature. You can cast this spell when the target is about to make
      a melee attack against another creature. On a failed saving throw, the
      target does not follow through with its attack, and its entire action is
      wasted for the round. On a successful saving throw, the target can make
      its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion but losing both
      accuracy and power, taking a -5 penalty on its attack and damage rolls.
      Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject to
      a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it originally
      targeted for the duration of the spell.</p>
