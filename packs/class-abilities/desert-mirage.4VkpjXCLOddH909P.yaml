      <p>Air and fire shroud you from your enemiesâ€™ vision and superheat your
      strikes in combat. You can surround yourself with heated air as a swift
      action, gaining concealment (as per the blur spell).</p><p>At 7th level
      while you are using this ability, your melee attacks each deal an
      additional 2 points of fire damage. You can use this ability for 1 minute
      per oracle level per day; this duration does not need to be consecutive,
      but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p><p>You must be at least
      3rd level to select this revelation.</p>
