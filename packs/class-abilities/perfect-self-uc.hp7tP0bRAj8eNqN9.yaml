      - Monk (Unchained)
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore
      treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original
      creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows
      him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a
      nonchaotic weapon.</p>

      <p>Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the
      dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type.</p>

      <p>Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm.
      During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at
      the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this
      ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.</p>
