    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes an eidolon to lose one evolution plus one additional
      evolution for every five caster levels. Evolutions with the highest total
      cost are lost first. If there is a tie, randomly determine which is lost.
      If this spell causes an eidolon to fail to meet the prerequisites for
      other evolutions or abilities, those evolutions or abilities are lost as
      long as this spell persists.</p>
