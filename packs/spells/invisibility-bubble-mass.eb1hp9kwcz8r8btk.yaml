      <p>This functions as per <i>invisibility bubble</i>, but the spell affects
      the areas of each target creature, regardless of the creature's size. The
      effect moves with the group and is broken when anyone in the group
      attacks. Individuals in separate bubbles can't see each other. The spell
      is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest
      member of the group. If only two individuals are affected, the one moving
      away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away
      from each other simultaneously, they both become visible when the distance
      between them exceeds 180 feet.</p>
