    value: >-
      <p>While the barbarian is raging, her melee attacks impose a temporary
      negative level on her opponent on a successful critical hit. After 1 hour,
      these temporary negative levels disappear automatically without a saving
      throw).</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level and have the lesser daemon totem
      rage power to select this rage power.</p>
