    value: >-
      <p>This flask of alchemical powder reacts to the elemental power in suli
      blood. Adding at least 1 hit point worth of suli blood to it creates an
      alchemical <em>splash weapon</em>. The <em>splash weapon</em> works like a
      flask of acid, except the damage is a random energy type (acid, cold,
      electricity, or fire). A DC 10 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check identifies
      what energy type the activated flask has. The activated flux retains its
      power for 24 hours before becoming inert material. The <em>Craft</em>
      (alchemy) DC to create this is 20.</p>
