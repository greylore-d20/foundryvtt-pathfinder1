    value: >-
      <p>You temporarily grant control of your familiar to another willing
      creature. You, your familiar, and the target creature must all be touching
      each other when you cast this spell. The target gains all the benefits and
      abilities normally associated with having a familiar, including the
      ability to share spells, speak with the familiar, and so on. You lose all
      of these benefits for the duration of the spell. If the target already has
      a familiar, the spell fails.</p>
