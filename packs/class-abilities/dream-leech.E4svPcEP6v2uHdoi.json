      "value": "<p>While adjacent to a sleeping or unconscious creature, you can take a swift action to siphon that creature’s dreams, thereby learning new things about your own mind. The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect; such creatures are never considered willing. Creatures that don’t dream are immune to this effect. If the subject fails the save, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against the subject within the next 24 hours, and you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, but no more than once per hour and no more than once per creature per day.</p>"
