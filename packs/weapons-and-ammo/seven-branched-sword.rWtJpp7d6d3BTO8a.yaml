      2-foot-long blade with six shorter L-shaped blades protruding from it,
      three on each side in a staggered pattern. The shorter blades can be used
      to snag opponents' clothing or armor, or can target weapons in order to
      disarm them. To snag armor or clothing, the attacker makes a trip attempt.
      If successful, the victim doesn't fall prone, but instead is snagged and
      stumbles forward, leaving the victim flat-footed for the remainder of the
      round.</p>
