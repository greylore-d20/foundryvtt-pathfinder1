      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can attempt to assert your dominance over any visible creature within 30 feet by declaring the target your property. The target can resist this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + half your class level + your Wisdom modifier). If the target fails the save, it is affected as if by&nbsp;dominate monster&nbsp;for a number of rounds equal to half your class level. The target can choose to ignore any order you give and instead take 2 points of Constitution damage and become staggered for 1 round. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 8th. This is a language-based mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Staff of Order power of the Law Domain.</p>"
