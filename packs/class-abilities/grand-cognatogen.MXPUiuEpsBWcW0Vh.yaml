  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist’s cognatogen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8
      alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score, and a
      +4 alchemical bonus to a third mental ability score. The alchemist takes a
      –2 penalty to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as long as the
      cognatogen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to each physical
      ability score when the cognatogen ends.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must have the greater
      cognatogen discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.</p>
