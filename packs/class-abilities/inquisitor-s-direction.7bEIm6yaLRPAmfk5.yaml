  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At the start of your turn, you can choose to enter a tranquil,
      reflective state and forgo all actions (standard, move, swift, immediate,
      and free actions, including attacks of opportunity) for that round; one
      ally of your choice within 30 feet gains the benefit of haste for 1 round.
      You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your 3 +
      Wisdom bonus (minimum 1).</p>
