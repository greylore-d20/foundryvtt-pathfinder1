      <p>Keleshites brag that they stole this spell from genie-kind thousands of
      years ago while other civilizations struggled without fire.</p><p>This
      spell causes an arc of flame to leap from your fingers, burning a number
      of enemies nearby. It deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level
      (maximum 10d6). For every additional target the discharge arcs to, reduce
      the number of damage dice by half (rounded down). Therefore, at 9th level,
      your <i>burning arc</i> deals 9d6 points of fire damage to the primary
      target, then 4d6 points of fire damage to a secondary target, then 2d6
      points of fire damage to an additional target.</p><p>Each target can
      attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the
      damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage
      of the primary bolt. You may choose secondary targets as you like, but
      they must all be within 15 feet of the primary target, and no target can
      be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets
      than the maximum.</p>
