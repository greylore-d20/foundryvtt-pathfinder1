      <p>This spell functions as <i>imbue with spell ability</i>, with the
      following exceptions: only bard spells of the conjuration (healing),
      enchantment, and transmutation schools can be transferred; the imbued
      spells last for 1 day; and the subject isn't beholden to any principles
      regarding the imbued spells' use.  As part of the casting, the caster must
      shed some of his blood (or an equivalent humor). If the caster isn't
      susceptible to bleed damage, regardless of the reason, he can't cast
      <i>blood song</i>. For each spell that is imbued using <i>blood song</i>,
      the caster loses 5 hit points, which can't be regained by any means until
      the spell ends or is discharged.</p>
