      "value": "<p>The alchemist learns how to create a @Compendium[pf1.spells.bvsi2gzhq49mmt2f]{Simulacrum}, a soulless duplicate, into which he can project his consciousness. As a full-round action, he may shift his consciousness from his current body to any one of his available doppelganger simulacra, which must be on the same plane as the alchemist. If killed in a simulacrum, he transfers to his own body automatically; if killed in his own body, he is dead. Unused simulacra (including his abandoned original body) appear to be lifeless corpses, though they do not decay.</p>\n<p>Creating a duplicate costs 1,000 gp in alchemical materials and requires 1 week to grow.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the alchemical simulacrum discovery before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.</p>"
