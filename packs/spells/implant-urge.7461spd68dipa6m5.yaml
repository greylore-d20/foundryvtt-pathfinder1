  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You make the target unconsciously desire a goal you define when you cast
    this spell. The DC of any Diplomacy check to ask the target to act in a way
    that it believes will lead it toward that goal decreases by 5. The target
    takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that
    compel it to act in a way that it believes will lead it toward that goal.
    Spells that reveal the target's goals or thoughts reveal the implanted urge
    as the target's most important goal and the target does not register as
    thinking of anything else as long as it is presented with the focus of its
    urge or a way to move toward its goal. Anyone studying the target's thoughts
    can notice the implanted nature of this urge with a successful caster level
    check.</p>
