    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can stave off the effects of a poison. As an
      immediate action when she fails a saving throw against a poison, the rogue
      can attempt the saving throw a second time. If she succeeds at this second
      saving throw, the poison does not affect her for a number of rounds equal
      to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round), but this time it counts
      against the poisonâ€™s duration. This talent has no effect on poisons with
      an onset longer than immediate.</p>
