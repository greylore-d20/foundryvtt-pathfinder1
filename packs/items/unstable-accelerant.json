In the hands of an <em>alchemist</em>, a flask of unstable accelerant can be used as part of creating a bomb, increasing its fire damage by +1d6 points. It has no effect on bombs that do not deal fire damage. If the bomb lasts for more than an instant, the extra damage only applies to the first round's damage.</p>\n<p><b>Create</b>: <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC 25</p>"
