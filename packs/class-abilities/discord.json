A successful Will save negates this effect. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch’s Intelligence modifier. The duration can be extended with the cackle hex. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, this effect decreases the attitude of the target creature by two steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p>"
