  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You forge a mental bond between yourself and the other targets, each of
      which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Choose one of your
      favored enemy types (such as goblinoids or magical beasts). You grant the
      targets half your favored enemy bonus against that type of creature. If
      any target moves out of range, the spell ends for it.</p>
