  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the cavalier can steel himself against harmful energies.
      Once per day as a move action, he chooses one of the following: acid,
      cold, electricity, or fire. He gains energy resistance 5 against the
      chosen type for 1 minute. At 12th, 16th, and 20th levels, the resistance
      increases by 5, and the cavalier gains an additional daily use of this
      ability.</p>
