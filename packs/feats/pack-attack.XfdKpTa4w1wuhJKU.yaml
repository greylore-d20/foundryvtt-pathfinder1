      <p><em>You are skilled at surrounding your
      enemies.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Base attack bonus
      +1.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you are adjacent to an ally with
      this feat, the first time you melee attack an opponent, you can spend an
      immediate action to take a 5-foot step, even if you have otherwise moved
      this round.</p><p><strong>Normal</strong>: You can take a 5-foot step only
      if you have not otherwise moved in a round.</p><h4>Combat
      Trick</h4><p>When you are adjacent to an ally that also has this feat, you
      can spend 2 stamina points to take a 5-foot step as a free action instead
      of an immediate action. You can still use this featâ€™s ability only once
      per round.</p>
