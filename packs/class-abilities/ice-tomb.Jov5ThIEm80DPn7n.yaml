    value: >-
      <p>A storm of ice and freezing wind envelops the target, which takes 3d8
      points of cold damage (Fortitude half). If the target fails its save, it
      is paralyzed and unconscious but does not need to eat or breathe while the
      ice lasts. The ice has 20 hit points; destroying the ice frees the
      creature, which is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being released.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the target's saving throw is successful, it cannot be
      the target of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
