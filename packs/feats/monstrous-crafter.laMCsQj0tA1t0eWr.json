      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 24</p><p><em>You can weave pieces of beasts into your magic items.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Craft Wondrous Item, Grisly Ornament, Harvest Parts.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you use the Grisly Ornament feat, you are able to permanently integrate one ornament you have crafted using the harvested creature parts into a wondrous item. The ornament grants no ongoing benefits, but once per day you can activate an integrated ornament as a free action to gain its full benefits for 1 minute. You can integrate an ornament into a wondrous item (or replace an item’s existing ornament) by spending 8 hours of work and 100 gp × the creature’s CR.</p>"
