      <p>The target becomes offensive to animals (Will negates). Animals become
      distraught and aggressive in the victim's presenceâ€”horses buck, dogs snap
      and bark, bulls charge, and so on. The hex lasts a number of hours equal
      to the witch's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>A creature that saves against
      the hex cannot be affected by the hex for 1 day. The reaction of the
      animals is a <em>mind-affecting charm</em> effect, but the hex on the
      target is not.</p>
