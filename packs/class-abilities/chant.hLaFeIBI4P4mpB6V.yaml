  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A shaman can chant as a move action. Any creature that is within 30
      feet that is under the effects of the shaman’s charm, evil eye, fortune,
      fury, or misfortune hex has that effect’s duration extended by 1
      round.</p>

      <p>A shaman cannot select both this hex and the witch’s cackle hex.</p>
