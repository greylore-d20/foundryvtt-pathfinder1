  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, when using the legacy style bloodline power, you can
      expend a spell slot as a swift action to share the benefits of the
      selected style feat with all allies within 30 feet. The benefits last for
      1 round per level of the spell slot expended. Allies must still enter the
      styleâ€™s stance as a swift action.</p>
