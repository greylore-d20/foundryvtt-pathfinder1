      <p>A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb.
      This potent device is used to store programming meant to augment or change
      an AI's functional nature. Full rules for memory facets are on page 62 of
      <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #86: Lords of Rust</em>. The memory facets
      detailed below can be found in this adventure.</p><p><strong>Intuition
      Facet</strong>: An intuition facet bolsters the AI's processing speed by
      allowing it to use probability and intuition to make incredibly swift
      decisions. The facet grants a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws and
      Initiative checks, as well as granting Dodge and Mobility as bonus feats
      when the AI is in an aggregate.</p>
