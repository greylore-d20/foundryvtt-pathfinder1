      <p>You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of
      20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a
      deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a
      10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for
      1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a
      -4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any
      spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.</p><p>Since you don't
      need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot
      square. Treat the target square as AC
      5.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.3E8pxbjI8MD3JbfQ]{Craft

      thunderstone and affects creatures in a 10-foot-radius spread as if a
