      "value": "<p>When you prepare your spells, you can also choose one cover identity—whether that of a real person or a fictitious one. You can assume the disguise of your cover identity in half the normal amount of time. When targeted by a spell or effect that would compromise your chosen disguise (such as&nbsp;detect evil,&nbsp;detect thoughts, or&nbsp;zone of truth), as an immediate action you can force the creature using the ability to attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails, it gains false information in keeping with your cover identity. You can use this false information ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Lore Keeper power of the Knowledge Domain or the Copycat power of the Trickery Domain.</p>"
