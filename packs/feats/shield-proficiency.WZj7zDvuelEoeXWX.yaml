    value: >-
      <p><em>You are trained in how to properly use a
      shield.</em></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: When you use a shield (except a
      tower shield), the shield's armor check penalty only applies to Strength-
      and Dexterity-based skills.</p><p><strong>Normal</strong>: When you are using
      a shield with which you are not proficient, you take the shield's armor
      check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve
      moving.</p><p><strong>Special</strong>: Barbarians, bards, clerics, druids,
      fighters, paladins, and rangers all automatically have Shield Proficiency
      as a bonus feat. They need not select it.</p>
