Brewing a potion takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less, otherwise brewing a potion takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. To brew a potion, you must use up raw materials costing one half this base price. See the magic item creation rules in Magic Items for more information.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.</p></p>\n                \n            \n            "
