  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As he gains levels, a magus learns arcane secrets tailored to his
      specific way of blending martial puissance and magical skill. Starting at
      3rd level, a magus gains one magus arcana. He gains an additional magus
      arcana for every three levels of magus attained after 3rd level.</p>

      <p>Unless specifically noted in a magus arcana's description, a magus
      cannot select a particular magus arcana more than once.</p>

      <p>Magus arcana that affect spells can only be used to modify spells from
      the magus spell list unless otherwise noted.</p>
