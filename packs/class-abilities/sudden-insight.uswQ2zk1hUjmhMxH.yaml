  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to gain an
      insight into your immediate future. You can use this foreknowledge as a
      free action before you roll any ability check, attack roll, or skill check
      to gain an insight bonus on that roll equal to 1/2 your occultist level
      (minimum +1).</p>

      <p>You can use your foreknowledge only once per turn, and if itâ€™s not used
      by the end of your turn, the insight fades and you gain no benefit.</p>
