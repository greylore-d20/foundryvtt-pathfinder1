    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you are immune to all transmutation spells and effects
      unless you are a willing target. You can also use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.t44p3oeq43jwcgwg]{Polymorph, Greater} at will as a
      spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your bloodrager level
      targeting only yourself. These effects function even while youâ€™re not
      bloodraging.</p>
