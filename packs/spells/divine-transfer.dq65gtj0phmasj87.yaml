  shortDescription: >-
    <p>With a single touch, you transfer some of your life essence to the
    subject, transferring your hit points and your resolve. When you touch the
    subject you can transfer up to a number of hit points equal to your
    Constitution score to the target. These hit points heal the subject, but
    cannot raise the subject's hit points higher than its normal hit point
    total. In addition, the subject gains DR/evil equal to your Charisma bonus
    (if any) for the duration of the spell.</p>
