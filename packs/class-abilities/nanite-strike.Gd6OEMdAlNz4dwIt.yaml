    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level as a <em>free action</em>, you can cause nanites to flow
      from your body and coat the striking end of any manufactured melee weapon
      you wield. When you hit with a melee attack using this weapon, some of the
      nanites infect the blood of the victim (Poisonâ€”injury; save <em>Fort</em>
      DC 10 + 1/2 your <em>sorcerer</em> level + your <em>Con</em> modifier;
      frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 <em>Str</em> damage; cure 1
      save).</p>

      <p>At 5th level, weapons you use with this ability are treated as magical
      for the purposes of overcoming <em>DR</em>, and the <em>poison</em> also
      deals 1 point of <em>Constitution damage</em>. At 7th level, the damage
      increases to 1d2 points of <em>Constitution damage</em> and 1d2 points of
      <em>Strength damage</em>. At 11th level, the cure becomes two successful
      saves.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 +
      your <em>Charisma</em> modifier; these rounds need not be consecutive.</p>
