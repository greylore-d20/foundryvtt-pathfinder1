    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, you gain the service of an animal companion. Your
      effective druid level for this animal companion is equal to your cleric
      level – 3. (Druids who take this ability through their nature bond class
      feature use their druid level – 3 to determine the abilities of their
      animal companions).</p>
