A nature shaman from the forest has a green tinge to her skin and hair, with eyes of sparkling emerald and the scent of green leaves and flowers about her. A nature shaman from the tundra is typically alabaster pale, with platinum hair and crystal blue eyes, and her skin always seems strangely cold.</em><br><br><strong>Spirit Magic Spells:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.pg7dbmuuaksxhp3v]{Charm Animal} (1st),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.la7kuehewu85ybnt]{Barkskin} (2nd),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.rrsefzpm3nhztvld]{Speak with Plants} (3rd),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.0sssdtv0tkbns2r3]{Grove of Respite} (4th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.h9qiwo9kx8d1hqrn]{Awaken} (5th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.wgm8mm1za909pwch]{Stone Tell} (6th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.f828mjoo5afszqnk]{Creeping Doom} (7th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.3ah9mmg0odateh8l]{Animal Shapes} (8th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.refg1teqkrdtxllg]{World Wave} (9th)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Spirit Animal:</strong> The shaman’s spirit animal looks feral, and appears to be in peak physical form.
