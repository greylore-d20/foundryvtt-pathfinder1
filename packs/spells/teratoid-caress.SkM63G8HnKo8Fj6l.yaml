  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With a gentle caress, you infuse the creature touched with a blight of
      energy from the Abyss that feeds upon goodness and transforms flesh into
      monstrous deformity. The target can resist a <em>teratoid caress</em> with
      a successful Fortitude save, but even on a successful save, the target
      becomes sickened for 1 round by the vile energies.</p><p>If the target
      fails the save, his body becomes infected with Abyssal energy and a small
      portion of his body distorts and grows hideous, inflicting 2 points of
      Dexterity damage or 2 points of Charisma damage (50% chance of either
      effect). This deformity is always unsightly and offensive. Thereafter, the
      victim suffers a -1 penalty on all saving throws against evil effects.
      Worse, whenever the victim casts a good spell, channels positive energy,
      or offers a prayer to a good-aligned deity, the Abyssal energies seethe
      inside him, forcing a new Fortitude save to resist suffering an additional
      1 point of Dexterity or Charisma damage. A good-aligned divine spellcaster
      who suffers from this curse suffers a -4 penalty on all concentration
      checks. This is a curse effect, but the effect can also be instantly
      removed with a @Compendium[pf1.spells.sg3eq6xpsum65fgm]{dispel evil} or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.qr6qcx8zqum6jhc4]{atonement} spell.</p>
