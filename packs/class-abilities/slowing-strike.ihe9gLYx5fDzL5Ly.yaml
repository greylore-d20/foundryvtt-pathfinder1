  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, the opponent
      must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the investigator’s class
      level + his Intelligence modifier) or be slowed by the crippling blow. A
      slowed opponent’s movement speeds are each reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum
      of 5 feet) until the creature is healed through the application of any
      spell that cures hit point damage or with a successful DC 15 Heal check.
      Multiple slowing strikes stack, to a minimum of 5 feet.</p><p>An
      investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.</p>
