      <p><b>Requirements:</b> Twinned eidolon.</p>

      <p>Select a 1-point or 2-point evolution the eidolon has. As a standard
      action, the eidolon can touch the summoner and transfer the selected
      evolution to him. This functions as the summonerâ€™s aspect ability, and the
      same limitations apply. The summoner can touch the eidolon as a standard
      action to return the evolution. The evolution returns to the eidolon
      automatically if the eidolon is dismissed by the summoner or sent back to
      its home plane.</p>
