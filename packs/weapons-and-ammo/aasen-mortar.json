Reloading the mortar is a full-round action, and the user loads a grenade-like projectile into the breech of the weapon's steel barrel, along with a blank rifle round that propels the bomb when triggered. The weapon uses indirect fire to lob bombs in slow-moving, high arcs, and the user targets a specific square.</p>\n<p>Rules for indirect-fire siege weapons are found on page 160 of Ultimate Combat or @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.Rft1LIY5C8XOK3Kr]{2.11.4.4. Siege Engine Details}. Mortars can also be fired as direct-fire siege engines. When used for direct fire, they take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and their range increment is halved, but they do not have a minimum range. After the point of impact is determined, the shell explodes and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage to all creatures in a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 20 for half ).</p>\n<p>An Aasen mortar has hardness 10 and 35 hit points; it fires special, finned fragmentation bombs that cost 10 gp each and weigh 4 pounds each. These bombs usually arrive on the battlefront in wooden cases containing 6 mortars each.</p>"
