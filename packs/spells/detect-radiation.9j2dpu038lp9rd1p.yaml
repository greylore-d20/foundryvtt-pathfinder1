  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You detect radiation in the surrounding area. You see radioactive auras
      as a glowing green shimmer in the air that emanates from radioactive
      objects; the brighter and more intense the green, the more powerful the
      radioactivity. This glow does not provide illumination or allow you to see
      in darkness, apart from being able to see the glow itself. The spell can
      penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
      common metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it-although radiation can
      seep into such barriers, causing them to become radioactive (and thus
      visible to the spell) in time.</p>
