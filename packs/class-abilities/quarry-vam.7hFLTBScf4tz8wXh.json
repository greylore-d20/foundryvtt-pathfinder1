      "value": "<p>At 14th level, as a <em>standard action</em> a vampire hunter can denote one target within his line of sight that he knows is <em>undead</em> as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a vampire hunter can take 10 on his <em>Survival</em> skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 <em>insight bonus</em> on <em>attack rolls</em> against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically confirmed. A vampire hunter can have no more than one quarry at a time. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a <em>free action</em>, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the vampire hunter sees proof that his quarry is <em>dead</em> or (somehow) was not actually <em>undead</em>, he can select a new quarry after 1 hour.</p>"
