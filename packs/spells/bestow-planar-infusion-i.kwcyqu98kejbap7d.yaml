    value: >-
      <p>This spell draws upon the latent planar energy of the caster's
      surroundings, allowing her to temporarily infuse a creature with the
      plane's power. The touched creature gains that plane's basic infusion for
      the spell's duration. This spell has no effect if cast on the Material
      Plane, and it ends as soon as the spell's target leaves the plane with
      which it has been infused. Details on planar infusions can be found in
      each plane's Infusion section, as presented in Chapter 3 of this book. 
      Once a creature gains the benefits of <i>bestow planar infusion I</i>, it
      remains attuned to that plane for 24 hours. Additional castings of
      <i>bestow planar infusion I</i> during this time bestow the same infusion
      that was granted by the initial casting that day. Planar infusions that
      can be used a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by
      multiple castings of <i>bestow planar infusion I</i>.</p>
