      <p>You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. If
      the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 +
      caster level) against the DC of each poison affecting the target. Success
      means that the poison is neutralized. A cured creature suffers no
      additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended,
      but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point
      damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their
      own.</p><p>This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous
      creature or object for 10 minutes per level, at the caster's
      option.</p><p>If cast on a creature, the creature receives a Will save to
      negate the effect.</p>
