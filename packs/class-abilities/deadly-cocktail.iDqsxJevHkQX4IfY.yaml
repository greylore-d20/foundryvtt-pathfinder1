  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can apply two doses of poison to a weapon
      at once. These can be separate poisons, in which case they both affect the
      target individually, or two doses of the same toxin, in which case the
      poisonsâ€™ frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2.
      This talent is an exception to the rule that injury poisons can only be
      delivered one dose at a time.</p>
