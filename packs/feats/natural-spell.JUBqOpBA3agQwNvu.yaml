      spells.</i><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 13, wild shape class
      feature.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You can complete the verbal and
      somatic components of spells while using wild shape. You substitute

      of a spell.</p><p>You can also use any material components or focuses you
      possess, even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat

      not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while
      using wild shape.</p>
