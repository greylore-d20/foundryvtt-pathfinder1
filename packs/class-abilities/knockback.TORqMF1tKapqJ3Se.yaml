    value: >-
      <p>Once per round, the barbarian can make a bull rush attempt against one
      target in place of a melee attack. If successful, the target takes damage
      equal to the barbarian's Strength modifier and is moved back as normal.
      The barbarian does not need to move with the target if successful. This
      does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
