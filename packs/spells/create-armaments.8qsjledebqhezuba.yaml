    value: >-
      <p>You create one nonmagical weapon, shield, or set of armor. To determine
      whether the item functions as intended, you must attempt an appropriate
      Craft check with the DC required to create the item normally. If you fail,
      the item is created with the broken condition. You can create items made
      of rare or unusual materials if you include a bit of that material as an
      additional material component when you cast the spell, but cannot create
      cold iron items with this spell.</p>
