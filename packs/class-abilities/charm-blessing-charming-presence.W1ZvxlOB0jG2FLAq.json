For 1 minute, the ally becomes mesmerizing to her opponents, filling them with either abject admiration or paralyzing fear. This effect functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.yk5bgi6j9kbtigof]{Sanctuary}, except if the ally attacks an opponent, the effect ends with respect to only that opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>"
