      <p>The target's flesh fills out and gains a healthy, natural color. This
      gives the target the appearance of a living creature of the type it was
      when it was still alive (if applicable). Creatures casting spells such as
      <i>detect undead</i> must succeed at a saving throw (with a DC equal to
      the spell's save DC) to detect the target's presence, and if the target is
      intelligent, it gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear alive or
      recently deceased. If the undead has any features different from those of
      the type of living creature it most resembles (such as a ghoul's elongated
      teeth and claws), those features shrink and become less prominent, and the
      subject deals damage as though it were one size smaller. This spell has no
      effect on creatures that are skeletal or otherwise lack flesh.</p>
