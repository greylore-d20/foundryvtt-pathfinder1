  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can gain control of a spell cast by another spellcaster.
      As a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the
      arcanist can make a caster level check opposed by the creature controlling
      the spell. If the arcanist is successful, she can direct the spell as a
      free action for 1 round, making any decisions allowed by the spell. This
      only functions on spells that can be directed or changed once they have
      been cast, such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.lzos34s87qsc620l]{Flaming
      Sphere} or @Compendium[pf1.spells.avofn5q2v0f0qxjy]{Spiritual Weapon}. The
      spell returns to its owner’s control at the start of the arcanist’s next
      turn, unless the arcanist expends another point from her arcane reservoir
      at the start of her turn to extend the duration of control by another
      round. She can continue to control the spell for as long as the spell
      lasts, provided she keeps spending points from her arcane reservoir.</p>
