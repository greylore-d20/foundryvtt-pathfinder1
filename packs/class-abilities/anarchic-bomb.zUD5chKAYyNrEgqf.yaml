  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal
      chaotic divine damage. Lawful creatures that take a direct hit from an
      anarchic bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their
      next turn. Against neutral creatures, anarchic bombs deal half damage, and
      such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Anarchic bombs
      have no effect on chaotic-aligned creatures.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
