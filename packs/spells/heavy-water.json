    "shortDescription": "<p>You cause a volume of water to become heavier than normal.</p><p>Swimming in or through such water requires a Swim check with a DC equal to the saving throw DC of this spell; even creatures with a swim speed must attempt this check. Success allows a creature to swim at up to half its speed as a full-round action; a creature cannot swim as a move action while in an area of <i>heavy water</i>. If a creature fails its Swim check by 4 or less, it makes no progress.</p><p>If it fails by 5 or more, it goes underwater.</p><p>All Perception checks to see through the affected water take a -10 penalty. All ships sailing through an area of <i>heavy water</i> move at half speed.</p>",
