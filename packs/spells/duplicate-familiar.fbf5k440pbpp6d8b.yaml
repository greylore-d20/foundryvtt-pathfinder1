    value: >-
      <p>You create a duplicate of a familiar. The familiar's master can use the
      duplicate as if it were his familiar in all respects, though he doesn't
      gain the bonus special ability from more  than one familiar at a time.
      When the spell's duration expires, the familiar duplicate shrivels into
      nothing, even if petrified or otherwise transformed.</p>
