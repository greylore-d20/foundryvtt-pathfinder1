      <p>At 5th level, you are so accustomed to complex tasks that you can
      maintain focus on multiple mental foci simultaneously. If you spend 1
      point from your phrenic pool as you cast a psychic spell that requires
      concentration, you can maintain concentration on that spell as a swift
      action. In addition, you can cast other psychic spells while concentrating
      on that spell.</p>
