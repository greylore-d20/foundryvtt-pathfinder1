  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike a foe
      before instantly returning. As a standard action, you can make a single
      attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated
      as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your Wisdom
      modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier (damage
      still relies on Strength). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat
      maneuver. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Wisdom modifier.</p>
