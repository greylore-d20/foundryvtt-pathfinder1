A ram can be used to deal damage or to make a Strength check against the target's break DC.</p><p><em>Ramming Charge</em>: Rams require momentum to be effective. All creatures using the ram must use the charge action to gain its full effect. Creatures not wishing to charge may make a ram attack as a full-round action, taking a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls and Strength checks with the ram.</p><p><em>Breaking</em>: The crew leader makes a Strength check with a +2 bonus, adding +2 for each member of the crew (or equivalent number of larger creatures; see <a href=\"Rules.aspx?Name=Siege%20Engine%20Rules&amp;Category=Siege%20Engines\">Crew under Siege Engine Rules</a>) assisting. The ram also provides a +4 bonus per size category above Medium.</p><p><em>Damage</em>: The crew leader makes an attack roll with a -4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals the listed damage, plus the Strength modifiers of the crew leader and all members of the crew, regardless of their size.</p><p><em>Improvised Ram</em>: Any tree, log, or timber can be used as a ram with a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls and Strength checks.</p><p><em>Pick</em>: A ram with a pick head grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and attack and damage rolls made against stone structures.</p><p><em>Screw</em>: A ram with a screw head grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and attack and damage rolls made against earthen structures.</p><p><em>Gallery Ram</em>: This is a ram suspended from chains or ropes within a gallery. A gallery ram does not require a charge action for full momentum. In addition, adding tethers to the back end of the ram allows four additional crew members to assist in using the ram.</p><p><em>Hit Points</em>: Rams have a hardness of 5 and hit points based on their size. A Large ram has 30 hit points, a Huge one has 120 hit points, a Gargantuan one has 320 hit points, and a Colossal one has 625 hit points. Improvised rams have half the normal hit points.</p>"
