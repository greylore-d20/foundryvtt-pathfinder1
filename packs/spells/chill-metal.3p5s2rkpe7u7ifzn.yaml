      <p><i>Chill metal</i> makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical
      metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw
      against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's
      saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.</p><p>A creature takes cold
      damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor,
      shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point
      or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing or wielding such an
      item.</p><p>On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and
      uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on
      the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the
      next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third,
      fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, and causes more
      damage, as shown on the table below.</p> <table

      affected metal, making it float if unattended.</p><p><i>Chill metal</i>
