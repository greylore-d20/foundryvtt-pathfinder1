  shortDescription: >-
    <p>When the caster hoists a flagon and delivers a toast to freedom, the
    target is transported up to 15 feet from its position to a space of your
    choice, though that space must be within your line of sight. If the target
    was prone at the time of casting, you can choose for the target to be
    standing upon reaching the destination. Furthermore, if the target was bound
    with nonmagical ropes, manacles, or other restraints, those restraints are
    not transported with the target, effectively freeing the target from those
    restraints. If the target is bound by magical restraints, you can bar those
    restraints from being transported with the target with a successful caster
    level check against a DC based on the restraints' caster level (DC = 11 +
    the restraining magic item's or spell's caster level).</p>
