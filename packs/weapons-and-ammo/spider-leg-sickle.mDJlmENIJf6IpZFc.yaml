  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This wickedly curved sickle is cast in the form of a segmented spider's
      leg. It has the same statistics as a normal sickle and can trip opponents,
      but deals piercing damage rather than slashing damage. The leatherwrapped
      handle contains a hollow recess that can hold a single dose of poison.
      Filling the reservoir is a full-round action that carries the usual risks
      of poisoning yourself. Once filled, the reservoir keeps the blade
      saturated and viable for up to 2 hours. The first successful attack made
      with the spider-leg sickle during this time administers and expends the
      dose of poison. Mog-Lathar's deacons carry masterwork versions of these
      weapons. The cult uses blue whinnis poison, and within the radius of the
      <em>dreamstone</em>'s effects the unconsciousness effect may trigger lucid
      dreaming.</p>
