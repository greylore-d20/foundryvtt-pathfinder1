        <p>This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend
        and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly). If the creature is
        currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however,
        it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.</p><p>The spell does not
        enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but
        it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can
        try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma
        check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries
        are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously
        harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous
        is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens
        the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's
        language to communicate your commands, or else be good at
        pantomiming.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, you can cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.tjog6bufg5b08lvq]{Charm Person} as a swift action,
      with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. You can
      only have one creature charmed in this way at a time. The total number of
      rounds of this effect per day is equal to your cleric level. The rounds do
      not need to be consecutive, and you can dismiss the charm at any time as a
      free action. Each attempt to use this ability consumes 1 round of its
      duration, whether or not the creature succeeds on its save to resist the
      effect.</p>
