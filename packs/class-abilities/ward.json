      "value": "<p>The shaman places a protective ward over one creature. The warded creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This effect lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A shaman knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A shaman can have only one ward active at a time. If the shaman uses this hex while a previous ward is still active, that previous ward immediately ends. A shaman cannot use this ability on herself.</p>\n<p>At 8th and 16th levels, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by 1.</p>"
