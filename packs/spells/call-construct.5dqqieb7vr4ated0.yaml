  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>instant summons</i>, except it can only
      summon a construct you control. For constructs such as golems that are
      immune to magic, the value of the specially inscribed sapphire must be at
      least 5,000 gp. For other constructs, a 1,000 gp sapphire
      suffices.</p><p>If the construct is no longer under your control or
      destroyed, the spell fails, but you know roughly where the construct or
      its remains are located.</p>
