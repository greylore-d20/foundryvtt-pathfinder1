      or large knot, as a lethal garrote. The ninja takes no penalties when
      using a scarf as an improvised garrote. In addition, as a free action when
      attempting a grapple combat maneuver check, the ninja can spend 1 ki point
      to gain the constrict special attack on that maneuver with damage equal to
      half the ninjaâ€™s sneak attack dice (minimum 1d6).</p>
