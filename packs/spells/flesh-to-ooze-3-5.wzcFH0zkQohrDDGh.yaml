      <p>This functions like @Compendium[pf1.spells.t8ei2mrmqg7252vw]{baleful
      polymorph}, except the target becomes an ooze. A creature of 3 HD or less
      becomes a gray ooze, 4–9 HD becomes a gelatinous cube or ochre jelly, and
      10+ HD becomes a black pudding. Alternatively, instead of a creature you
      may target a quantity of inert flesh (such as that created by the
      <em>stone to flesh</em> spell) of sufficient mass, which becomes an ooze
      of your choice.</p><p>Because a target’s gear does not transform with it,
      any items fall under or within the ooze’s body, which may mean the items
      are destroyed. If the ooze has the split ability, splitting the ooze
      creates one ooze that retains the creature’s original identity (for the
      purpose of memories or restoring the creature) and one normal mindless
      ooze of that type.</p>
