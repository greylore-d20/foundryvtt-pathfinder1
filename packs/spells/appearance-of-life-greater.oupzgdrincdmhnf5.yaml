      <p>This spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.lgfgb40gpe9f81zh]{appearance of life} (Pathfinder
      <em>RPG Horror Adventures</em> 108), except that you can disguise a single
      undead creature regardless of its number of Hit Dice, and the illusion
      also creates relevant smells, sounds, textures, and temperatures to match
      the appearance. If you disguise the target as a living version of itself,
      creatures that interact with the target take a -5 penalty on their Will
      saving throws to disbelieve the illusion, though if the target attacks a
      creature, the attacked creature no longer takes this penalty.</p>
