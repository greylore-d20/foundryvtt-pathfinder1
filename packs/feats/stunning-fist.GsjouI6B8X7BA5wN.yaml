      <i>You know just where to strike to temporarily stun a foe.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your
      attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist
      forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving
      throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition
      to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is
      stunned for 1 round (until just before your next turn). A stunned
      character drops everything held, can't take actions, loses any Dexterity
      bonus to AC, and takes a -2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning
      attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see
      Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants,
      undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits
      cannot be stunned.</p>

      <p><b>Special</b></p>

      <p>A monk receives Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he
      does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a stunning attack a
      number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per
      day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.</p>
