      <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> In order to prepare this spell, the caster must
      spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches <b>Grundinnar</b>.
      Further details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of
      Golarion.</em></p><p>You can attempt to influence unfriendly or hostile
      creatures, altering their attitudes toward you. After casting, make a
      Diplomacy check against the creatures as a free action; you gain a +2
      sacred bonus on this check against creatures that failed their saves
      against the spell. Even if you favorably manipulate the attitude of the
      affected targets, they quickly revert to their previous attitude if
      threatened or treated poorly.</p>
