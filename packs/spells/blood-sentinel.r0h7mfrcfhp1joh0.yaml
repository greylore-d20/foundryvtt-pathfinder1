  description:
    value: >-
      <p>After casting this spell, you pour a few drops of your blood and saliva
      into the mouth of the animal sculpture material component, temporarily
      giving it life. The animal is bonded to you as if it were a familiar, and
      it has the abilities of a familiar (use your caster level as your
      effective wizard level to determine its abilities), but it does not grant
      you the Alertness feat or the special ability of its animal type. If your
      blood sentinel is slain, you take 2 points of Intelligence drain and the
      blood sentinel's body becomes a destroyed statue. This spell has no effect
      if you already have a familiar or another blood sentinel.</p>
