  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante can use Stealth to hide even when being observed. As long
      as he is within 10 feet of dim light (his own shadow doesnâ€™t count), he
      can hide without anything to actually hide behind.</p>

      <p>Only a stalker vigilante of at least 8th level can select this
      talent.</p>
