      <p>With this spell, you can transfer one magic tattoo from one creature to
      another. A target that isn't willing to have his tattoo removed or to
      receive the transferred tattoo can resist this spell with a Fortitude
      save-if successful, the transfer fails and the caster of this spell is
      staggered for 1 round by the backlash of magical energy. A tattoo can be
      transferred from a dead creature in this manner to a living host, provided
      the body has been dead no longer than one hour per caster level.</p>
