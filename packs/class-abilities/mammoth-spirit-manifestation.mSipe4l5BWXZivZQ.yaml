    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, the shaman can transform into any animal listed under
      the megafauna or elephant heading. This ability works as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.br37848gchetel0q]{Beast Shape IV}, but the shaman
      can activate and dismiss the ability as often as she likes and the
      duration is permanent.</p>
