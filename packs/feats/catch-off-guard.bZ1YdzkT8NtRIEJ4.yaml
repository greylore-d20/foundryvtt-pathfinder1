    value: >-
      <em>Foes are surprised by your skilled use of unorthodox and improvised
      weapons.</em><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You do not suffer any penalties
      for using an improvised melee weapon. Unarmed opponents are flat-footed
      against any attacks you make with an improvised melee
      weapon.<p><strong>Normal</strong>: You take a -4 penalty on attack rolls
      made with an improvised weapon.<h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>When making an
      attack with an improvised weapon against an armed opponent, you can spend
      5 stamina points. If you do, the target is considered flat-footed during
      that attack. An opponent who recognizes you and has seen you use Catch
      Off-Guard in this way is immune to this effect.
