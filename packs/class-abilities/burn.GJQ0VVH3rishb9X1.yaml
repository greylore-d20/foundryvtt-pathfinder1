  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, a kineticist can overexert herself to channel more power
      than normal, pushing past the limit of what is safe for her body by
      accepting burn. Some of her wild talents allow her to accept burn in
      exchange for a greater effect, while others require her to accept a
      certain amount of burn to use that talent at all. For each point of burn
      she accepts, a kineticist takes 1 point of <em>nonlethal damage</em> per
      character level. This damage can’t be healed by any means other than
      getting a full night’s rest, which removes all burn and associated
      <em>nonlethal damage</em>. Nonlethal damage from burn can’t be reduced or
      redirected, and a kineticist incapable of taking <em>nonlethal damage</em>
      can’t accept burn. A kineticist can accept only 1 point of burn per round.
      This limit rises to 2 points of burn at 6th level, and rises by 1
      additional point every 3 levels thereafter. A kineticist can’t choose to
      accept burn if it would put her total number of points of burn higher than
      3 + her <em>Constitution</em> modifier (though she can be forced to accept
      more burn from a source outside her control). A kineticist who has
      accepted burn never benefits from abilities that allow her to ignore or
      alter the effects she receives from <em>nonlethal damage</em>.</p>
