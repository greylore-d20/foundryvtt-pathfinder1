      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 21</p><p>As a standard action, you can create a 15-foot cone of sticky mud. Any creature in the cone must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) or become entangled for 1 round for every wizard level you have. An affected creature can take a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity to wipe off enough of the mud to remove the entangled condition. Jumping into a large body of water or being subject to an effect that creates a substantial amount of water (such as a casting of create water) removes all the mud on a creature. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>"
