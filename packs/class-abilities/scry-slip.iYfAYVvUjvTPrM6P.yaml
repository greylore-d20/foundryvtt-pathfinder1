    value: >-
      <p>Whenever a character with this talent is targeted by a scrying effect
      that allows a Will save, the caster of the divination must succeed at a
      caster level check (DC = 15 + the rogueâ€™s class level). This talent wards
      the rogue and any objects she is holding or carrying. An investigator can
      select this talent in place of an investigator talent.</p>
