    value: >-
      <p>Laying a hand upon an allied creature's jaw, claws, tentacles, or other
      natural weapons, you enhance the power of that creature's natural attacks.
      Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature
      were two sizes larger than it actually is (see page 302 of the
      <i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> for more information). If the creature is
      already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt by
      each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually change
      the creature's size; all of its statistics except the amount of damage
      dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged.</p>
