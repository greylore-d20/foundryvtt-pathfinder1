      "value": "<p>Street thieves in Absalom expect wares to be securely locked, and sometimes it takes high-quality tools and magic training to ensure there’s a meal at the end of the day. A rogue with this ability can use spell-trigger and spell-completion items as if the following spells were on a spell list to which he has access: detect secret doors, detect traps, knock, locate object, and obscure object. If the spell-trigger device allows a wielder to apply his own caster level (such as with a staff ), the rogue may use his class level as his caster level. The rogue may also use knock as a supernatural ability once per day, using his rogue level as his caster level.</p>"
