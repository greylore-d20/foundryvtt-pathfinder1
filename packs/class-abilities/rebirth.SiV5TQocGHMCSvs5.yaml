    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, the full power of a <em>phoenix</em> erupts from within
      you if you perish. When you die, you are brought back to life, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.mxqi375ya2rka7cp]{True Resurrection}, after 1
      minute. This ability can be used only once every 24 hours, and if you are
      slain again within this period, your death is permanent.</p>
