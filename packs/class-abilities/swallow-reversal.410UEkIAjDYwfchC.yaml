  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This technique, a creation of a legendary Minkaian duelist, mimics the
      movement of a bird in flight to pierce an opponent's defenses. As an
      attack action, the slayer can make a single melee attack against his
      studied target at his highest base attack bonus. When attempting a swallow
      reversal, the slayer rolls two attack rolls and uses the highest result.
      If the attack is a critical threat, the slayer attempts to confirm the
      critical hit as normal.</p>

      <p>The slayer can use swallow reversal at will, but it can only be used
      against a given target once per day.</p>
