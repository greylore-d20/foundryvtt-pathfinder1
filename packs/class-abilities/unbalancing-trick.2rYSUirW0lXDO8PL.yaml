  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The character gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.gTrGPxzN054GfpkM]{Improved
      Trip} as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th
      level, she is treated as if she meets all the prerequisites of
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.lNyMFFQaOxxTOW7M]{Greater Trip} (although she must
      take the feat as normal to gain its benefits).</p>
