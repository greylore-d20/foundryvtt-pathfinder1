    value: >-
      <p>You call upon the cleansing or searing fires of the Outer Rifts to burn
      your foes. As a standard action, one target within 30 feet is wreathed in
      screaming flames and takes 1d6 points of fire damage per level. A
      successful Reflex save halves this damage.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, the fireâ€™s howls cause any creatures damaged by it to be
      staggered for 1 round.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, creatures who fail their saves against the balefire are
      staggered for 1d4 rounds and stunned for 1 round.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day
      at 10th level.</p>
