      Engine</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Trebuchets are similar in form to
      catapults, with the payload placed into a basket, cup, or sling at the end
      of a long lever, and a counterweight (often with crew or animals pulling
      attached ropes) close to the fulcrum. The leverage imparted by a trebuchet
      allows it to hurl massive missiles that scatter to a number of squares
      around the target square based on the size of the trebuchet. Trebuchets
      are too bulky to move on wheels or vehicles and must be assembled on the
      battlefield. Trebuchets have a minimum range of 150
      feet.</p><p><em>Light</em>: These Large siege engines typically hurl large
      stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 15). A light trebuchet's
      ammunition scatters on contact, dealing full damage to the target square
      and half its damage to creatures and objects within 5 feet of the target
      square (creatures can make a DC 15 Reflex save to halve the damage again).
      Light trebuchets have a hardness of 5 and 50 hit points. One use of light
      trebuchet stones costs 15 gp and weighs 60
      pounds.</p><p><em>Standard</em>: These Huge siege engines typically hurl
      large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 20). A standard
      trebuchet's ammunition scatters on contact, dealing full damage to the
      target square and half damage to creatures and objects within 15 feet of
      the target square (creatures can make a DC 20 Reflex save to halve the
      damage again). Standard trebuchets have a hardness of 5 and 100 hit
      points. One use of standard trebuchet stones costs 30 gp and weighs 110
      pounds.</p><p><em>Heavy</em>: These Gargantuan siege engines typically
      hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 25). A heavy
      trebuchet's ammunition scatters on contact, dealing full damage to the
      target square and half its damage to creatures and objects within 30 feet
      of the target square (creatures can make a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the
      damage again). Heavy trebuchets have a hardness of 5 and 200 hit points.
      One use of heavy trebuchet stones costs 40 gp and weighs 120 pounds.</p>
