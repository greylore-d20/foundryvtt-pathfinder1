    value: >-
      <p>You implant a mental mine within your psyche that triggers against
      anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. Any creature that uses a
      mind-affecting effect against you triggers the mine, causing psychic
      backlash against the offending creature. This backlash deals 1d6 points of
      damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and staggers the target for 1d4
      rounds.  If the target succeeds at a Will saving throw, it takes only half
      damage and negates the staggered effect. The mine does not disrupt the
      mind-affecting effect that triggered the spell. You can use a swift action
      to suppress the trigger of your mine for 1 round to allow someone to use a
      mind-affecting effect on you. You can have only one mental mine active at
      a time.</p>
