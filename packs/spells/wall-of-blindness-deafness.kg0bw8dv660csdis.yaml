      <p>You create a translucent wall of energy, within which can be seen
      indistinct images of faces with their eyes or ears sewn shut. When you
      create the wall, decide whether it blinds or deafens. Any creature that
      passes through the wall must save or become permanently blinded or
      deafened (as blindness/deafness).  The wall must be vertical and either
      rectangular or a ring. It need not touch the ground. The wall must be
      continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any
      object or creature when it is cast, the spell fails.</p>
