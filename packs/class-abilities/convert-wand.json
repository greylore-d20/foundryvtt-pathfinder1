      "value": "<p>An arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a full-round action to convert one wand that is in her possession into a wand of a cure spell with the same spell level and caster level (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name). For example, she could convert a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=stone%20shape\">wand of stone shape</a>&nbsp;into a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=cure%20serious%20wounds\">wand of cure serious wounds</a>. This alteration lasts for 1 minute, after which the wand reverts to its original function. Charges expended while the wand was altered are still expended when it reverts.</p>"
