      "value": "<p>A witch can compel a plant within 30 feet to spread a message, which must be 25 words or fewer and in a language the witch speaks. This message can’t contain verbal spell components, command words, or other magical effects. An intelligent plant that’s targeted can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the save fails, the plant is magically compelled to “speak” this message in an audible voice, repeating it each time one or more intelligent creatures to whom the message has not yet been repeated comes within range, until 24 hours after the hex has been placed. The plant under the effect of the hex does not gain any special intelligence from this hex or gain any ability to understand the message if it does not normally understand the language the message is delivered in, and it is in no way otherwise compelled to act in any way it would not normally.</p>\n<p>A witch can have a number of heralding blooms active equal to her witch level + her Charisma modifier.</p>"
