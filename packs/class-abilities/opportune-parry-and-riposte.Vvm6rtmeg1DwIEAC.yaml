  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the
      swashbuckler, she can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack
      of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack. The swashbuckler makes an
      attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size
      category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the
      swashbuckler takes a -2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater
      than the attacking creature's result, the creature's attack automatically
      misses. The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the
      creature's attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon
      performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point, the
      swashbuckler can as an immediate action make an attack against the
      creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her
      reach. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that
      reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.</p><hr
