    value: >-
      <p>You utter a dire curse over the body of a dying creature, allowing you
      to consume its waning life force. Upon casting this spell, you touch a
      living creature that has –1 or fewer hit points. If the target fails its
      saving throw, it dies and you gain 1 hero point for every 5 Hit Dice
      possessed by the target (minimum 1, maximum 3). These hero points last for
      a number of minutes equal to the target’s Hit Dice. Any hero points
      remaining when this spell ends are lost.</p>
