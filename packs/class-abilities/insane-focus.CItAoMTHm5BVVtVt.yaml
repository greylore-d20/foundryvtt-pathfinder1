  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, granting it a +4
      bonus on all saving throws made against mind-affecting effects and
      immunity to confusion. This bonus lasts for 1 minute. If the creature
      fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect during this period,
      it loses its immunity to confusion and is immediately confused for one
      round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Visions of Madness power of the Madness
      Domain.</p>
