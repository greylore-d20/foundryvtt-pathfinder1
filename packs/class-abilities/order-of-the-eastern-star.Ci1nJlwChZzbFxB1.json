      "value": "<p>This cavalier order exists to keep dangerous secrets hidden from the world and secretly protect the world against unimaginable threats from beyond the mortal realms. These cavaliers scout and observe, concerning themselves not with the trivial pursuit of morality, but rather with ensuring the survival of society itself.<p><b>Edicts:</b> The cavalier must preserve the secrets of his order while acting to protect civilization against occult threats. He must thwart the schemes of otherworldly horrors and must give his order a full accounting of any potential threats.<p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever a cavalier of the order of the eastern star issues a challenge, he receives a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 insight bonus on saves against the attacks and abilities of the target of his challenge. He must be wearing light armor and carrying no more than a light load to receive these bonuses. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier possesses.<p><b>Skills:</b> A cavalier belonging to the order of the eastern star adds Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (planes) to his class skills. He can attempt Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (planes) checks untrained. If he has ranks in these skills, as long as a check involves knowledge of the occult or supernatural, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>\n<p><b>Feats:</b> A cavalier of this order gains <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Psychic%20Sensitivity\">Psychic Sensitivity</a> as a bonus feat.</p>"
