    "shortDescription": "<p>You exchange the crude matter of your material body with the insubstantial essence of the Plane of Shadow, becoming a living shadow yourself. You are visible as an unattached shadow in bright light or normal light, but you gain total concealment in dim light or darkness. Against creatures with darkvision, you gain concealment rather than total concealment. Your <i>shadow body</i> is incorporeal for most purposes, though you can't fly or pass through solid objects or creatures. However, you can move at your normal speed along any surface, including horizontal and vertical surfaces and liquids, and you are never slowed by difficult terrain. Your size doesn't change.  You can speak and cast spells and perform mental actions, but you have no physical substance and cannot manipulate objects or attack physically. You can deliver touch spells and effects as if making an incorporeal touch attack. Your equipment merges with your <i>shadow body</i>, so you can't cast spells with a material component unless those spells are prepared with Eschew Materials.</p>",
