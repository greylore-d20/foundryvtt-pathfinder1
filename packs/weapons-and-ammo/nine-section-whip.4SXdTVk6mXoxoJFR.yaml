  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The nine-section whip consists of steel bars linked together. The final
      bar is a 6-inch weighted spike. This weapon can be wielded as a
      single-handed weapon, a two-handed weapon, or in pairs. Nine-section whips
      often have colored cloth flags attached to the ends to make them easier to
      control.</p>
