      <p>Found most often in lands heavily modified by magic, this bulbous
      cactus is topped with twilight-blue flowers.</p>

      <p>The <em>sap</em> from the cactus can be used as an additive when
      crafting <em>potions</em>, causing all variable numeric effects of the
      <em>potion</em> to be determined as if the <em>potion's</em> <em>caster
      level</em> were 1 higher.</p>

      <p>When processed into a powder with a successful DC 15 <em>Craft</em>
      (alchemy) check, Twilight dagger can be used as an additional material
      component when casting spells, granting the user a +1 <em>alchemical
      bonus</em> on <em>caster level</em> checks to overcome <em>spell
      resistance</em>.</p>
