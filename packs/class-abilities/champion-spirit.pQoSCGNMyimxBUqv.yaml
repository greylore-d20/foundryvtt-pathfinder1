      <p><em>A champion spirit is a paragon of skill at arms.</em>

      <p><b>Spirit Bonus:</b> When you channel a champion, your spirit bonus
      applies on attack rolls, non-spell damage rolls, Strength checks,
      Strength-based skill checks, and Fortitude saves.</p>

      <p><b>Seance Boon:</b> You gain a +2 bonus on all non-spell damage
      rolls.</p>

      <p><b>Favored Locations:</b> Arenas, battlefields, places of violence,
      practice yards.</p>

      <p><b>Influence Penalty:</b> You are quick to violence and prefer a weapon
      to spells or contemplation. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus
      on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks, and to your
      caster level (to a minimum of caster level 0); as usual, a reduced caster
      level may render you unable to cast spells. You can’t benefit from effects
      that increase your caster level.</p>

      <p><b>Taboos:</b> Choose one: you are superstitious about arcane
      spellcasting, so you must not be the willing target of arcane spells or
      abilities and you must attempt a Will saving throw against even harmless
      arcane spells and abilities; you may not make an attack with any weapon
      except a specific manufactured weapon (such as “my father’s +2 falchion”)
      that you choose when you take the taboo, and you may not choose unarmed
      strike for this taboo; you must accept any challenge to prove your prowess
      in battle, including challenges to single combat—if you or an ally breaks
      the rules of the challenge, you break this taboo.</p>
