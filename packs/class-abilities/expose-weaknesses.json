      "value": "<p>The vigilante is able to use sneaky tricks to make it easier to damage a foe, whether it is throwing a bit of fine dust of cold iron over a fey creature or melting a glob of silver onto a lycanthrope’s hide. The vigilante can add the ability to reduce a creature’s damage reduction or hardness by 10 to the list of options when attempting a dirty trick combat maneuver check (Advanced Player’s Guide 320). This does not stack with itself, and it does not work against creatures with DR/—.</p>"
