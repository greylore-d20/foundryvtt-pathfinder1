  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Behind this long pole weapon's spearhead, several short branches
      project from the shaft at irregular intervals, each angled forward and
      tipped with a smaller leaf like blade. When you make attacks of
      opportunity provoked by movement, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls. You
      can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead
      of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with an elven branched spear
      sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. Elves treat elven
      branched spears as martial weapons.</p>
