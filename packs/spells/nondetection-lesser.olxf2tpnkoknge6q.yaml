      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.awia42zci8nufpfl]{nondetection}, except
      it blocks the effects of only divination spells and effects that target an
      area, rather than you or an object in your possession specifically. For
      example, lesser <em>nondetection</em> doesn't ward you against a
      spellcaster who is attempting to scry on you with the <em>scrying</em>
      spell or find an object in your possession with <em>locate object</em>,
      but it does protect you against effects that target an area you happen to
      be in, such as detect spells or <em>clairaudience/clairvoyance</em>.</p>
