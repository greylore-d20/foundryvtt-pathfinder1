  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can have a poison remain inert until a
      later time. When she delivers a contact or injury poison, instead of the
      poison’s normal onset time, the character can delay the poison’s effects
      until up to 1 day from when it is delivered (minimum 1 round). The delayed
      poison can be detected as normal by spells such as detect poison and
      similar abilities.</p>
