      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This item works like a standard wrist sheath, but releasing an item
      from it is a swift action. Preparing the sheath for this use requires
      cranking the sheathâ€™s tiny gears and springs into place (a full-round
      action that provokes an attack of opportunity).</p>
