      <p>You imbue a weapon with a faint silvery glow that dimly illuminates a
      5-foot square. An affected weapon also easily bypasses the physical
      defenses of undead creatures, ignoring 5 points of an undead creature's
      damage reduction, as long as the damage reduction is not DR/epic. For
      example, attacks with a weapon affected by this spell completely ignore a
      zombie's DR 5/slashing or reduce a lich's damage reduction to DR
      10/bludgeoning and magic.  You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon,
      such as an unarmed strike. <i>Funereal weapon</i> affects the DR of only
      undead creatures.</p>
