    value: >-
      <p>When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive
      energy that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
      +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage
      to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell
      resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.</p>
