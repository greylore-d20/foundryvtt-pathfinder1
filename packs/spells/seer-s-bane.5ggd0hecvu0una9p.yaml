      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.awia42zci8nufpfl]{nondetection}, except
      that those who cast divination spells targeting the warded creature or
      item must succeed on a caster level check (DC = 15 + your caster level).
      If the caster of the divination fails, deadly magical feedback strikes at
      him, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage per 2 caster levels you have
      (maximum 10d6 at 20th level). Alternatively, if you cast <em>bestow
      curse</em>, <em>chaos hammer</em>, <em>contagion</em>, <em>holy
      smite</em>, order's wrath, <em>poison</em>, or <em>unholy blight</em> in
      the round immediately following seer's bane, you can replace the spell's
      damaging effect with the effects of that second spell (the divination's
      caster-and potentially those around him-save as normal for the modifying
      spell).</p>
