      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements: </strong>Summoner level 5th.</p>\n<p>The eidolon grows large wings, like those of a bat, bird, insect, or dragon, gaining the ability to fly. The eidolon gains a fly speed equal to its base speed. The eidolon’s maneuverability depends on its size. Medium or smaller eidolons have good maneuverability. Large eidolons have average maneuverability, while Huge eidolons have poor maneuverability.</p>\n<p>For 2 additional evolution points, the eidolon flies by means of magic. It loses its wings, but its maneuverability increases to perfect. If the eidolon flies by magic, this is a supernatural ability.</p>\n<p>The eidolon can increase its fly speed by spending additional evolution points, gaining a 20-foot increase to its fly speed for each additional point spent.&nbsp;</p>"
