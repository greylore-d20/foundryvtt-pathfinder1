If the arcanist successfully disbelieves an illusion, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to try to negate or steal control of the illusion. The arcanist attempts a caster level check as if she were dispelling the effect with @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic}. If she succeeds, she can either end the effect or alter it as if she were the spell’s caster. If the spell’s duration is concentration, the arcanist must concentrate on the new effect or it ends.</p>\n<p>The arcanist must have the first-world face thief exploit to select this exploit.</p>"
