    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any <i>Small</i>
      or <i>Medium</i> corporeal creature of the undead type, which must be
      vaguely humanoid-shaped (like a ghoul, skeleton, or zombie). You gain a
      bite attack (1d6 for <i>Medium</i> forms, 1d4 for <i>Small</i> forms), two
      claw or slam attacks (1d6 for <i>Medium</i> forms, 1d4 for <i>Small</i>
      forms), and darkvision 60 feet. If the form you assume has any of the
      following abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 30 feet, fly 30
      feet (average maneuverability), swim 30 feet, low-light vision, and
      scent.</p><p>In this form, you detect as an undead creature (such as with
      <i>detect undead</i>, but not with magic that reveals your <i>true</i>
      form, such as <i>true</i> seeing) and are treated as undead for the
      purposes of channeled energy, <i>cure</i> spells, and <i>inflict</i>
      spells, but not for other effects that specifically target or react
      differently to undead (such as <i>searing</i> light).</p><p><i>Small</i>
      undead: If the form you take is that of a <i>Small</i> undead, you gain a
      +2 size bonus to your Dexterity and a +1 natural armor
      bonus.</p><p><i>Medium</i> undead: If the form you take is that of a
      <i>Medium</i> undead, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength and a +2
      natural armor bonus.</p>
