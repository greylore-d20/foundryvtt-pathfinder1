      <p>You concentrate feelings of competitiveness, envy, and ill will into a
      poltergeist-like haunt that wreaks havoc on its victim's long-term
      endeavors. Every time a creature in the affected area attempts a Craft or
      Profession check to generate income, create an item, or earn capital
      (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i> 85), any skill check required for
      crafting or repairing a magic item, or any skill check required for an
      occult ritual (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 208), the haunt
      imposes a -5 penalty on the check. If the creature fails its check by 5 or
      more, the haunt's mischief deals 1d6 points of damage to the creature in
      addition to any other negative effects from such a failure. If the
      creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or
      longer, the haunt becomes similarly disruptive, requiring the caster to
      succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) or lose the spell
      and take 1d6 points of damage from the mischief. Each time the haunt is
      disruptive, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that
      round.</p>
