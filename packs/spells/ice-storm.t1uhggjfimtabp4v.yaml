  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Great magical hailstones pound down upon casting this spell, dealing 3d6
    points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature
    in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the
    remaining duration of the spell, heavy snow and sleet rains down in the
    area. Creatures inside this area take a -4 penalty on Perception skill
    checks and the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of
    the duration, the snow and hail disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other
    than the damage dealt).</p>
