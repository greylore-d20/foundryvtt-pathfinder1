    value: >-
      <p>When she uses her powerful blow rage power, the barbarian also deals
      bleed damage equal to her bonus damage with the powerful blow. This bleed
      damage bypasses damage reduction.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the powerful blow rage power and be at least 8th
      level before selecting this rage power.</p>
