    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions exactly as the spell <i>nightmare</i>. In addition
      to the effects of that spell, you can cause a second spell to be delivered
      when the target wakes at the <i>nightmare</i>'s conclusion.</p><p>You must
      have this second spell prepared, and it must be cast immediately after
      <i>vision of Lamashtu</i> (effectively adding the two spells' casting
      times). This second spell "rides along" with the <i>nightmare</i>,
      affecting the target as soon as it wakes from its fitful sleep. Any spell
      can be sent along with the <i>nightmare</i>, so long as it is of 6th level
      or lower, affects one target (which is always the <i>nightmare</i>'s
      recipient), and does not deal hit point damage. The second spell's range
      is irrelevant for the purposes of <i>vision of Lamashtu</i>, and even
      touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must still make a
      successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with the
      act of touching occurring within the context of the victim's
      <i>nightmare</i>). The target is allowed to save against the second spell
      if a save is allowed. For example, a cleric of Lamashtu could send
      <i>bestow curse</i> along as part of a <i>vision of Lamashtu</i>, but not
      <i>blade barrier</i> (affects an area), <i>destruction</i> (too high
      level), or <i>inflict moderate wounds</i> (deals hit point damage).</p>
