      "value": "<p>At will as a standard action, the shaman can invoke whispers from spirits of the Dark Tapestry to speak directly into the mind of a single target within 30 feet. These whispers utilize no known language, yet the victim nevertheless feels convinced that, somehow, it was almost able to comprehend the message. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be confused for 1 round.</p>\n<p>At 8th level and again at 16th level, the confusion caused by this hex lasts for 1 additional round.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the save is successful, the shaman cannot target that creature with this hex again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>"
