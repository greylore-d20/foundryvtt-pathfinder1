      <p>You cause ammunition, including shuriken, to glow with faint silvery
      light. The ammunition counts as magic and silver for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction, in addition to the properties of any other
      special material the ammunition has. Incorporeal undead and shapechangers
      take an additional 1d8 points of damage from such ammunition. The targeted
      ammunition sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 round after it is
      fired or thrown.</p>
