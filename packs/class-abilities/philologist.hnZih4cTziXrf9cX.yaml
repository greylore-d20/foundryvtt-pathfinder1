    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent can reroll any Linguistics skill check made to
      decipher writing in an unfamiliar language, and never risks drawing a
      false conclusion from a failed Wisdom check after a failed Linguistics
      check. A rogue with this talent is allowed only one reroll per
      inscription, message, or text encountered.</p>
