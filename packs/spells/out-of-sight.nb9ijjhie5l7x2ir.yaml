      <p>The spell inhibits the memories of creatures that perceive you. While
      creatures can perceive you normally, when a creature stops observing you,
      it must attempt a Will save (spell resistance applies). If it fails, it
      loses all memory of its awareness of you and your actions while you were
      under the effects of this spell. The spell's duration listed above
      measures how long the <i>Out of Sight</i> effect lasts on you, but the
      memory alteration is instantaneous and can be reversed only by magic such
      as <i>modify memory</i>.  The creature is still aware of any other changes
      to itself or its environment. For instance, a guard will remember running,
      and may notice a newly unlocked door, but will not remember that he was
      chasing after you.</p>
