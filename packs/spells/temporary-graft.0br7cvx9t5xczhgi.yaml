  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You temporarily graft a dismembered body part onto yourself. You must
      have the body part in your possession or the spell has no effect. The
      graft must come from a creature the same size category as you. You can
      have only one graft active at a time. Grafting on a new body part
      immediately ends the effects of the older casting and causes that body
      part to fall off. The effect of the graft depends on the type of body part
      you choose to graft to yourself, as follows. <i>Fins</i>: The fins grant
      you a 40 foot swim speed. <i>Head</i>: The head grants you all-around
      vision. If the head came from a creature that had darkvision, low-light
      vision, or scent, you gain the appropriate senses at half the normal
      range. You can speak through either head, but not both simultaneously. You
      don't receive any additional special abilities the head might have had
      (like a medusa's petrifying gaze ability). <i>Leg</i>: The leg increases
      your base movement speed by 5 feet and grants you a +2 bonus to CMD
      against overrun and trip combat maneuvers (the usual bonus for having an
      extra leg). <i>Wings</i>: The wings grant you a 40-foot fly speed (poor
      maneuverability).</p>
