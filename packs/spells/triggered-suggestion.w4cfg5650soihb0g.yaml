      <p>This spell functions as <i>suggestion</i>, except you can use it only
      to specify a condition that triggers a special activity, and the subject
      does not remember that you made the <i>suggestion</i>.</p><p>For example,
      you could use triggered <i>suggestion</i> on a palace guard to make him
      attack the king the next time he and the king are alone, and the guard
      would not remember the <i>suggestion</i> to do so until the trigger
      occurred.</p>
