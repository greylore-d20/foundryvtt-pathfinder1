  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian howls during combat, agitating nearby fauna. Willing
      animals and magical beasts within 30 feet of the barbarian gain the
      benefits of the @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.8u1xa5javcxc6szk]{rage}
      spell for as long as she maintains her rage. After the barbarianâ€™s rage
      ends, creatures affected by her rage are fatigued for the same number of
      rounds as the barbarian.</p><p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to
      choose this rage power.</p>
