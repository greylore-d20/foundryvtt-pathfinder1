            <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot
            radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional
            20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light
            becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in
            normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it
            as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
            equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire
            damage.</p>

            <h3>Magic Containers</h3>

            <p>Magic containers come in almost as many varieties as there are
            <em>alchemists</em>, and so are of inestimable value to
            <em>alchemists</em> with specific needs. Some of the most well-known
            magic containers are described here.</p>

            <p>Because of a varied nature of alchemical items and their effects,
            not all combinations of alchemical items and magic bottles are
            viable or even make sense, even though they technically might be
            allowed by the rules. The GM should have the final say on whether or
            not a particular alchemical item can function within one of the
            magical containers listed in this section.</p>

            <h4>Rope</h4>

            <p><b>Hempen</b> The DC to escape hemp rope bonds is equal to 20 +
            the CMB of the creature that tied the bonds. Ropes do not need to
            make a check every round to maintain the pin. If the DC to escape is
            higher than 20 + the tying creatures CMB, the tied up creature
            cannot escape from the bonds, even with a natural 20 on the check.
            This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength
            check. <b>Price</b> 1 gp; <b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>FYI</b>: The <em>Equipment Trick</em> feat provides a number
            of options for using this item in combat.</p>

            <p><b>Silk Rope</b> This 50-foot length of silk rope has 4 hit
            points and can be broken with a DC 24 Strength check. <b>Price</b>
            10 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>Bloodvine Rope</b> This 50-foot length of tough, lightweight
            rope is made from alchemically treated bloodvine, a rare
            scarlet-colored vine that grows only in warm jungle environments.
            Though prized by climbers for its durability, bloodvine can also be
            used to bind creatures. Bloodvine rope has a <em>hardness</em> of 5
            and 10 <em>hit points</em>, and can be broken with a DC 30
            <em>Strength</em> check. A creature bound by bloodvine rope can
            escape with a DC 35 <em>Escape Artist</em> check or a DC 30
            <em>Strength</em> check. The DC to create bloodvine rope with
            <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) is 30. <b>Price</b> 200 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5
            lbs. <b>Source</b> <em>PRG:ACG</em></p>

            <p><b>Spider's Silk Rope</b> This 50-foot length of rope is woven of
            strands of silk from monstrous spiders. Rare to virtually
            nonexistent on the surface world, it is commonly used by the dark
            elves, though shorter spider's silk rope scraps (generally no more
            than 10 feet long) occasionally appear among goblins. Spider's silk
            rope has 6 hit points and can be broken with a DC 25 Strength check.

            <h4>Candle</h4>

            <p>A candle dimly illuminates a small area, increasing the light
            level in a 5-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light and
            dim light becomes normal light). A candle cannot increase the light
            level above normal light. A candle burns for 1 hour. <b>Price</b> 1
            cp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>

            <p><b>Candle, Helmet</b> This device consists of a helmet with a
            short, thin spike on top upon which a <em>candle</em> is stuck,
            freeing your hands for other tasks. <b>Price</b> 2 gp; <b>Weight</b>
            4 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>Candle Lamp</b> A candle lamp is a small lantern-like device
            with glass panels and a slot to hold a <em>candle</em>. It protects
            the <em>candle</em> from drafts and catches wax drippings. It
            provides the same light as a <em>candle</em>, but can be shuttered
            such that it only illuminates 1 to 3 adjacent squares. You can use a
            <em>candle lamp</em> to keep your hands warm. <b>Price</b> 5 gp;
            <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>

            <p><b>Candlestick</b> This saucer-like object has a flat bottom, a
            handle, and a spike on top. You can affix a <em>candle</em> onto the
            spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the candlestick by the
            handle. The flat bottom means you're able to set it down and not
            worry about the <em>candle</em> falling over and extinguishing
            itself. A typical candlestick is crafted from baked <em>clay</em> or
            a cheap metal such as copper, but elaborate and expensive ones
            exist. <b>Price</b> 1 cp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>
