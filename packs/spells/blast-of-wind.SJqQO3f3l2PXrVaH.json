This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.cnuin981hdq7ryit]{Gust of Wind}, except all creatures within the area are treated as though they were one size category smaller for the purpose of determining how the spell affects them. For every 4 caster levels beyond 7th, creatures in the area are treated as an additional size category smaller (to a maximum of three size categories smaller at 15th level).</p>"
