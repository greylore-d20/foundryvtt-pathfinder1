      "value": "<p>A bard of 14th level or higher can use his performance to cause fear in his enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the bard perform and be within 30 feet. Each enemy within range receives a&nbsp;<em>Will</em>&nbsp;save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s&nbsp;<em>Cha</em>&nbsp;modifier) to negate the effect. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save fails, the target becomes&nbsp;<em>frightened</em>&nbsp;and flees for as long as the target can hear the bard’s performance. Frightening tune relies on audible components.</p>"
