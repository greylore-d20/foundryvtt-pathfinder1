  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This ammunition is specifically crafted from silver, and though
      nonmagical, it is particularly detrimental to lycanthropes, automatically
      confirming any critical threats against such creatures. A firearm that is
      shooting a silver bullet takes a -1 penalty on damage rolls (with a
      minimum of 1 point of damage).</p>
