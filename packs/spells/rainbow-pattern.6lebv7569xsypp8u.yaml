    value: >-
      <p>A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those
      within it. <i>Rainbow pattern</i> fascinates a maximum of 24 HD of
      creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among
      creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of
      origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is
      fascinated by the pattern.</p><p>With a simple gesture (a free action),
      you can make the <i>rainbow pattern</i> move up to 30 feet per round
      (moving its effective point of origin). All fascinated creatures follow
      the moving rainbow of light, trying to remain within the effect.
      Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still
      try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area,
      each fascinated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is
      completely blocked, creatures who can't see them are no longer
      affected.</p><p>The spell does not affect sightless creatures.</p>
