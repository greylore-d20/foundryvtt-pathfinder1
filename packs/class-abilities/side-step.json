The fissure begins in any square you designate and allows you to teleport to any other square you can see within 10 feet per occultist level. Stepping between these locations requires you to expend 5 feet of movement, and the movement through the rift does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This otherwise functions as&nbsp;teleport.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>"
