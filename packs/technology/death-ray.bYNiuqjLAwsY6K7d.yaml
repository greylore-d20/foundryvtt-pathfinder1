      touch</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A death ray is a handheld, wandlike weapon
      that fires a harmless carrier beam of energy at a target. When the beam
      hits a target, the death ray then projects a stream of specialized nanites
      through the beam into the body of the target. When firing a death ray, the
      wielder must decide how many charges of nanites she is consuming, to a
      maximum of 10. Even if the wielder engineers a method of using a larger
      reserve of nanites than normally come in a canister, this maximum does not
      increase. Immediately upon being struck, the nanites inflict incredible
      pain on the target, which must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw to
      avoid a grisly fate (DC = 10 + twice the number of charges consumed by the
      attack). For example, if 1 charge is consumed, the target must succeed at
      a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist the death ray, but if all 10 charges are
      consumed in the attack, the DC to resist the effects is 30.</p><p>If the
      target fails this save, it takes 100 points of damage as the nanites tear
      apart the victim's cardiovascular system. On a successful saving throw,
      the victim takes only 6d6 points of damage. Creatures slain by a death ray
      die spectacularly, seeming to melt into a pool of blood that swiftly fades
      away. The victim's gear is unaffected by this attack. A death ray has no
      effect on creatures that aren't living (such as constructs or undead) and
      can't penetrate a force field. The wielder can't score critical hits with
      a death ray. A death ray has a maximum range of 200 feet with no range
      increment.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 32;
