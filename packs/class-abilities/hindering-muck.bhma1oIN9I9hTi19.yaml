      <p>As a standard action, you can create a 15-foot cone of sticky mud. Any
      creature in the cone must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your
      wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) or become entangled for 1 round
      for every wizard level you have. An affected creature can take a standard
      action that provokes attacks of opportunity to wipe off enough of the mud
      to remove the entangled condition. Jumping into a large body of water or
      being subject to an effect that creates a substantial amount of water
      (such as a casting of create water) removes all the mud on a creature. You
      can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Intelligence modifier.</p>
