      Thrown</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A net is used to entangle enemies. When
      you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A
      net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An
      entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to
      Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you
      control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while
      holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that
      the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it
      must succeed at a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level
      or be unable to cast the spell.</p><p>An entangled creature can escape
      with a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net
      has 5 hit points and can be burst with a successful DC 25 Strength check
      (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within
      one size category of you.</p><p>A net must be folded to be thrown
      effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a
      normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a -4
      penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user
      to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.</p>
