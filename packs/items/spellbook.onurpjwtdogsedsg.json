Compact spellbooks hold only 70 pages of spells, but they weigh significantly less than an ordinary spellbook. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>\n<p><b>Traveling Spellbook</b> A traveling spellbook is lighter and less cumbersome than its full-size counterpart. It has 50 pages. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO9410</em></p>\n<p>Spellbook Extras</p>\n<p><b>Book Lariat</b> This braided metal cord comes with a clasp that affixes to the lock of a standard <em>spellbook</em>. The other end of the cord attaches to a belt or belt loop. The cord is 10 feet long and retractable. If you drop your <em>spellbook</em> while it's attached to the lariat, you can recover the <em>spellbook</em> as a <em>standard action</em>. While attached to you, the book can never be farther than 10 feet from you. Unclasping the book requires a <em>move action</em>, or the cord can be cut to free the book (<em>hardness</em> 5, hp 10). <b>Price</b> 3 sp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1129</em></p>"
