If he is stunned, he is instead dazed. If he is exhausted, he is fatigued. If he is frightened, he is shaken. If he is paralyzed, he is staggered. The duration of the effect is unchanged; the effect is simply reduced to the lesser version. This spell has no effect on conditions not listed above.</p>"
