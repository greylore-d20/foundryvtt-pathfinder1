A dose of nightsage burns for 10 minutes and can be extinguished and reignited for multiple uses (but it is always used in 1 minute increments, regardless of the actual time spent burning).</p>\n<p>While nightsage burns, each corporeal <em>undead</em> creature within a 5-foot radius gains a +2 <em>profane bonus</em> on saving throws against positive energy effects (including <em>channel energy</em> effects). Necromancers are fond of supplying their <em>undead</em> minions with small thuribles containing a burning stick of nightsage that can be worn while carrying out their commands. A moderate or stronger wind extinguishes a burning stick of nightsage.</p>"
