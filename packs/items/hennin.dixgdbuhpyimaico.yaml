      <p>This high conical headpiece ends in a tip that usually has a piece of
      silk or similar diaphanous material dangling from it. Women of noble birth
      sometimes wear a hennin to formal or social occasions as a signal of their
      eligibility, and give the silk part of the headpiece as a token to suitors
      they favor.</p>
