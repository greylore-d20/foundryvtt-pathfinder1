  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can attach another spell that you cast to one of your
      blast runes, causing that spell to affect the creature that triggers the
      rune, in addition to the damage. This spell must be of at least one level
      lower than the highest-level cleric spell you can cast and it must target
      one or more creatures. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can
      normally affect, it only affects the creature that triggers the rune.</p>
