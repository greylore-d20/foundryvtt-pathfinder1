  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You make a conduit between the targeted master and her familiar, allowing
    you to target the master or the familiar with your spells in order to affect
    the other. If the master succeeds at its save to resist this spell but the
    familiar fails, you can choose to have your spells that target the master
    affect the familiar instead. If the familiar resists but the master doesn't,
    your spells that target the familiar can affect the master instead. If both
    the familiar and the master fail to resist this spell, you can affect either
    the familiar or the master when you target either with a spell. When you
    target the master to affect her familiar or vice versa, the target attempts
    a save (if one is allowed) with its own saving throw bonus, but the other
    creature is affected by the spell.  Only spells that target one or more
    creatures can be cast through <i>empathy conduit</i>. The creature to be
    affected must still be a valid target of the spell being cast; for example,
    you can't affect a familiar with <i>charm person</i> through an <i>empathy
    conduit</i>. Spells with a duration other than instantaneous that are cast
    through an <i>empathy conduit</i> last either their normal duration or until
    the <i>empathy conduit</i> expires, whichever comes first. Whenever the
    master or its familiar is targeted with a spell intended to affect the other
    creature, the targeted creature can attempt an additional save against the
    <i>empathy conduit</i>.</p>
