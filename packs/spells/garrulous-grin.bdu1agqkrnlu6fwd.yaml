      <p>This Nidalese spell plants a seed of supernatural fear deep in a
      subject's mind, causing self-doubt, stuttering, and evasiveness. Affected
      creatures have difficulty meeting anyone's gaze and seem dishonest or
      guilty. The target takes a -4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to 
      convince another of the truth of her words, and on Diplomacy or Intimidate
      checks to influence another creature's attitude.</p>
