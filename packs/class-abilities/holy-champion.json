      "value": "<p>At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-damage-reduction\">DR</a> increases to 10/evil. Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes an evil outsider, the outsider is also subject to a @Compendium[pf1.spells.trl849bibbe760xo]{Banishment}, using her paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the @Compendium[pf1.spells.trl849bibbe760xo]{Banishment} effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount.</p>"
