  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This heavy blade has a single sharp edge, concave at the bottom and
      convex at the top, with a hook-shaped hilt. Its shape distributes the
      weight to give it the momentum of an axe with the cutting edge of a sword,
      much like a larger version of a kukri. The hooked hilt is sometimes carved
      to resemble the head of a horse or bird of prey, and may have a thin chain
      stretched across its opening, acting as a partial guard for the hand and
      fingers.</p>
