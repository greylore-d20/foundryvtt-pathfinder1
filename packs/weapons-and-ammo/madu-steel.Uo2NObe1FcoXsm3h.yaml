      with two animal horns-usually from an antelope-extending from opposite
      sides. If you are proficient with the madu, you may use it to fight
      defensively with a -2 penalty instead of the normal -4, and your attack
      penalty for using Combat Expertise improves by +1 (minimum -1 penalty).
      You cannot hold anything else in the hand that bears a madu. If you are
      not proficient with the it, treat it as a light spiked shield. A madu
      can't be disarmed. It can be crafted entirely out of metal, but both
      versions offer the same basic protection and attack benefits, though they
      respond differently to some spells and effects. A druid can use a leather
      madu, but not a steel madu.</p>
