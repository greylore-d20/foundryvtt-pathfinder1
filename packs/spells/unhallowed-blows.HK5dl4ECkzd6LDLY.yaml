      <p>This spell empowers the natural attacks or unarmed strikes of undead
      creatures, granting a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls made
      by the target with its unarmed strikes or attacks with one natural attack.
      This spell can cause an undead creatureâ€™s unarmed strike to deal lethal
      damage, but in this case, the attack does not gain an enhancement
      bonus.</p><p><em>Unhallowed blows</em> can be made permanent with a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.nsxngq65mbrzgwnm]{permanancy} spell. In this case,
      the caster must be at least 9th level and must expend 2,500 gp worth of
      diamond dust as a material component.</p>
