  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian deals normal damage to incorporeal
      creatures even when using nonmagical weapons. She also gains a +3 morale
      bonus to touch AC, which increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels
      thereafter (to a maximum of +7 at 20th level). This canâ€™t raise her touch
      AC above her full AC..</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level before selecting this rage
      power.</p>
