  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, an inquisitor can imbue one of her weapons with the bane
      weapon special ability as a swift action. She must select one creature
      type when she uses this ability (and a subtype if the creature type
      selected is humanoid or outsider). Once selected, the type can be changed
      as a swift action. This ability only functions while the inquisitor wields
      the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability
      if it is returned to the inquisitor before the duration expires. This
      ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the inquisitorâ€™s
      level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
