      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.l01ajd0m4xgwq3fd]{magic aura}, except it
      extends its altered aura to similar items in a 5-foot radius. For this
      purpose, similar items must be alike in approximate shape, composition,
      and function, so a <em>potion of cure light wounds</em> targeted by this
      spell to appear nonmagical would also obscure the auras of nearby potions,
      elixirs, and oils, as well as flasks. Items other than the targeted item
      retain their altered aura for 1 round per caster level after being removed
      from the spell's area.</p>
