The hinged jaws of the <em>trap</em> are attached to a chain, which in turn is secured to a spike driven into the ground to ensure that the victim cannot simply crawl away. Prying open the jaws or pulling the spike from the ground requires a DC 20 <em>Strength</em> check.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Offset Bear Trap CR 1/2</h5>\r\n<p><b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.; <b>Price</b> 3 gp</p>\r\n<p><b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Notice</b> <em>Perception</em> DC 15; <b>Disable</b> <em>Disable Device</em> DC 20</p>\r\n<p><b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Reset</b> manual</p>\r\n<p><b>Effect</b> Atk +10 melee (1d6+2); jaws spring shut around the creature's ankle and hold the creature immobile; the creature can escape with a DC 20 <em>Disable Device</em> check, DC 24 <em>Escape Artist</em> check, or DC 28 <em>Strength</em> check.</p>\r\n<p>An offset <em>bear trap</em> is a specialized variety of a <em>bear trap</em> constructed with offset jaws coated in resin.</p>\r\n<p>It inflicts less damage on captured creatures but holds them more securely, and is therefore primarily used by <em>trappers</em> or bounty <em>hunters</em> who do not want to risk killing their prey. Offset bear traps are almost always secured to the ground by a heavy spike and <em>chain</em> so the captured creature can't wander far.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Sawtooth Bear Trap CR 5</h5>\r\n<p><b>Weight</b> 20 lbs.; <b>Price</b> 1,800 gp</p>\r\n<p><b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Notice</b> <em>Perception</em> DC 25; <b>Disable</b> <em>Disable Device</em> DC 25</p>\r\n<p><b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Reset</b> manual</p>\r\n<p><b>Effect</b> Atk +15 melee (3d6+9); serrated jaws spring shut around the creature's ankle and halve the creature's base speed (or hold the creature immobile if the <em>trap</em> is attached to a solid object); the creature can escape with a DC 25 <em>Disable Device</em> check, DC 28 <em>Escape Artist</em> check, or DC 32 <em>Strength</em> check.</p>\r\n<p>A sawtooth <em>bear trap</em> has vicious jaws and tighter springs.</p>\r\n<p>Used primarily against <em>humanoids</em> or monsters rather than <em>animals</em>, sawtooth bear traps are often painted in camouflaged colors to <em>blend</em> in with the <em>trap</em> site. Most include locking plates over the spring mechanisms to prevent tampering by intelligent victims.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n"
