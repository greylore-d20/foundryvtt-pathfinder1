      <p>With this spell, you create shafts of blue light that illuminate all
      undead creatures in the area. Affected undead take a -20 penalty on all
      Stealth checks. Invisible undead are not made visible by this effect, but
      the light does make it easy to pinpoint the exact squares in which such
      undead are located (they still retain the 50% miss chance granted by
      invisibility).</p><p>The <i>light of Iomedae</i> increases light levels by
      one step in a 5-foot radius around an affected undead creature. Once an
      undead is affected, it remains illuminated as long as remains within the
      spell's range, even if it leaves the spell's original radius, until the
      spell's duration ends.</p><p>Affected undead must also make a Will save
      when they are first illuminated by the <i>light of Iomedae</i>. Those who
      fail this save lose all benefits of channel resistance and take a -2
      penalty on all saving throws made against positive energy effects.</p>
