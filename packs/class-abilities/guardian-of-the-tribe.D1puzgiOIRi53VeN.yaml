      <p>The shaman can cast a harmless spell with a range of touch on a member
      of her tribal bond as long as that creature is within 30 feet. The shaman
      can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma
      modifier (minimum 1). In addition, she is constantly aware of the
      condition of all members of her tribal bond ability, as
