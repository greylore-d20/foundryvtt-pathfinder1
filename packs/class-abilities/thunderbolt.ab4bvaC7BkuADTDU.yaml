      <p>At 9th level, you can command a stroke of lightning to strike from
      above in a 5-foot-radius cylinder 60 feet high. The thunderbolt inflicts
      1d6 points of damage per sorcerer level; half of this damage is
      electricity and half is sonic. A <em>Reflex</em> save (DC 10 + 1/2 your
      sorcerer level + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier) halves this damage.
      Creatures failing their saves are <em>deafened</em> for 1 round. At 9th
      level, you can use this ability once per day, at 17th twice per day, and
      at 20th three times per day. This power has a range of 120 feet.</p>
