    value: >-
      <p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate Intrigue pg. 16</p><p>The vigilante’s
      wild attacks allow him to block his foes’ counterattacks. He gains Power
      Attack as a bonus feat. If he already has the Power Attack feat, he can
      immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level
      he chose Power Attack. When he takes an attack or full attack action, if
      he uses Power Attack on every attack to make melee attacks that use his
      Strength bonus on attack rolls, he gains a shield bonus to his AC until
      his next turn equal to his penalty on attack rolls from Power Attack. This
      bonus applies only if he actually takes that penalty on at least one of
      the attack rolls.</p>
