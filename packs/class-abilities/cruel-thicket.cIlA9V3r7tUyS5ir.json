      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can cause the ground in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on you to sprout twisting, thorny vines. Any creature moving through it must travel at half speed or take bleed damage equal to half your cleric level; if you activate this ability in an area with numerous plants (grass, weeds, trees, etc.), the area also becomes difficult terrain. These effects last for 1 minute, after which the vines crumble to dust. Creatures able to move through natural undergrowth unhindered ignore the effects of this ability. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Wooden Fist power of the Plant Domain.</p>"
