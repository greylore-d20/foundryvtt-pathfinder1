    value: >-
      <p>The repeating heavy crossbow holds 5 repeating crossbow bolts. As long
      as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a
      free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that
      provokes attacks of opportunity.</p><p>You can fire a repeating crossbow
      with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner
      as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire
      the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you
      must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.</p>
