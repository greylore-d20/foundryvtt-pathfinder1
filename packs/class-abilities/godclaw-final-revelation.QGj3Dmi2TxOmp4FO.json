      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 20th level, you can cast detect chaos, detect law, and discern lies at will as spell-like abilities, using your oracle level as your caster level. You no longer take armor check penalties for wearing armor, and your armorâ€™s maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 5. Once per day, you can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.1zyixa5b6aw7npub]{Crushing Hand} as a spell-like ability without requiring a focus component, treating your oracle level as your caster level. This hand manifests as a massive, spiked gauntlet.</p>"
