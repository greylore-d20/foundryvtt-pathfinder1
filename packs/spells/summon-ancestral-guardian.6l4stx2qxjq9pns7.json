Each appears as a transparent image of a powerful, wise dwarf armed with a traditional dwarven weapon of your choice. These spirits move and attack at your direction, each having the abilities of a <i>spiritual weapon</i>, except they can attack different targets and deal physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, according to the weapon the spirit wields) instead of force damage. Like creatures conjured with a <i>summon monster</i> spell, your ancestors are not harmed if these manifestations are destroyed.</p>"
