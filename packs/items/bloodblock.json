Using a dose gives you a +5 alchemical bonus on Heal checks for providing first aid, treating wounds made by caltrops or similar objects, or treating deadly wounds. A dose of bloodblock ends a bleed effect as if you had made a DC 15 Heal check. When treating deadly wounds, using a dose of bloodblock counts as one use of a healer's kit (and grants the +5 bonus stated above).</p>\r\n<p><b>Create</b>: <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a> (alchemy) DC 25</p>\r\n"
