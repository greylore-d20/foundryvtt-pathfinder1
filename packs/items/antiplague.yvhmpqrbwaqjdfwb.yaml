      <p>If you drink a vial of this foul-tasting, milky tonic, you gain a +5
      alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against disease for the next
      hour. If already infected, you may also make two saving throws (without
      the +5 bonus) that day and use the better

      For each vial of antiplague used as a power component, one creature eating
      the feast gains the benefits of antiplague for 12 hours. Antiplague's
      normally foul taste does not change the taste of the
      feast.</li><li><em>Remove Disease</em> (M): Add +2 on your <em>caster
      level</em> check to cure diseases on the target.</li></ul>
