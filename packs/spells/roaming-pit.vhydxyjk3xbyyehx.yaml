      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.8w67l6dzzsi6oz5f]{create pit}, except the
      pit is capable of movement. As a move action, you can direct the pit to
      move up to 20 feet, though it must always remain on a horizontal surface
      large enough to accommodate its area. If the pit's movement causes it to
      share a space with a creature on the same horizontal surface, that
      creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or fall into the pit. Any
      creature that avoids falling into the pit when it reaches its new
      destination moves to the nearest safe space. Creatures that fall into the
      pit move with it if it is relocated.</p>
