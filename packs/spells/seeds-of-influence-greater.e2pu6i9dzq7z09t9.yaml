      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.5sltdv83psx6wodr]{Seeds of Influence},
      except that if the target is protected by a spell that grants immunity,
      spell resistance, or a saving throw bonus against a divination or
      mind-affecting spell you cast on the target, you can attempt caster level
      checks to dispel each such effect before applying the effects of those
      protections against the spell. The DC of the caster level check to dispel
      each effect is equal to 11 + the effect's caster level. Such spells cast
      on the target while greater <em>Seeds of Influence</em> is active grant no
      protection against greater <em>Seeds of Influence</em>.</p>
