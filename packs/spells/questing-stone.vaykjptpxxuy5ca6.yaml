  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>arcane eye</i>, except that it uses an
      <i>ioun stone</i> as a visible scrying sensor. The <i>ioun stone</i> moves
      at the same rate as an <i>arcane eye</i>, and may pass through holes or
      spaces as small as 2 inches in diameter. It can enter another plane of
      existence using a <i>gate</i> or similar portal, but the caster loses
      contact with the sensor should this occur. The enhanced <i>ioun stone</i>
      has AC 24, 10 hp, hardness 5, fly speed 30 (perfect), and a +16 Stealth
      bonus. The stone does not provide you with its normal benefits while you
      are using it as a scrying sensor.</p>
