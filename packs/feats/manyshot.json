      "value": "<i>You can fire multiple arrows at a single target.</i>\n<p>\n<p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>\n<p>Dex 17, Point-Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Benefits</b></p>\n<p><p>When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires two arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as a ranger's favored enemy bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each arrow.</p></p>"
