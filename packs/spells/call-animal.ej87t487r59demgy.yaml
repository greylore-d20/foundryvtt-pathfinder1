  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you
      designate (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster
      level) to seek you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power,
      so the time it takes to arrivedepends on how close an animal of the
      desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal of that
      type capable of reaching you within the spell's duration, you are aware of
      this fact, but the spell is wasted. Knowledge of the local fauna makes
      this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a Knowledge (nature)
      skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an
      area.</p><p>When the called animal arrives, it approaches to within 5 feet
      of you and remains nearby for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Its
      starting attitude is indifferent, modified by circumstances and
      interaction. Other than starting attitude, this spell gives you no special
      influence or ability to communicate with the called animal, although you
      may use other spells or abilities to do so.</p><p>Once the spell's
      duration expires, the animal acts in accordance with its attitude. Most
      animals will likely wander off, but a hostile predatory animal may attack,
      especially if it is hungry or provoked.</p><p>Domesticated animals or
      animals trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars or
      animal companions, are unaffected by <i>call animals</i>.</p>
