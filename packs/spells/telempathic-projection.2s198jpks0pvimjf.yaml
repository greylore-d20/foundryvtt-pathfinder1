      <p>You alter the target's mood, adjusting its attitude toward you or
      another creature you designate by one step either positively or negatively
      (see the Diplomacy skill on page 94 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i>
      Rulebook). You can instead use this spell to assist your own or an ally's
      Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perform, or Sense Motive check, granting
      that check a +5 insight bonus against the target of your <i>telempathic
      projection</i> with no save. In this case, the spell's duration expires
      immediately when the skill check is complete.</p>
