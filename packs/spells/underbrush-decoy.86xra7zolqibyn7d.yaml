      <p>You cause a plant to rustle noisily, distracting nearby creatures. You
      can attempt a Bluff check to create a distraction to hide, using your
      caster level + your Wisdom modifier in place of your total Bluff skill
      bonus and applying the result to all creatures within 30 feet. You count
      the target as distracted, as do any creatures that knew about your
      distraction in advance. Creatures might not be distracted if they detect
      you casting the spell or otherwise anticipate your subterfuge.</p>
