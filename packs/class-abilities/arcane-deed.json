The magus can use that deed by using points from his arcane pool as the panache points required for that deed. Even if he gains a panache pool through another means, the magus is not considered to have at least 1 point in his panache pool for the purpose of deeds selected with arcane deed, and his effective swashbuckler level for determining such a deed's effect is 0.</p>\n<p>A magus can take this arcana multiple times, each time gaining a new deed.</p>\n<p>The magus must have the flamboyant arcana to select this arcana.</p>"
