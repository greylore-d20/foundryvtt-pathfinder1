      strap and holds about 2 cubic feet of material. Some may have one or more
      smaller pockets on the sides.</p><p>This leather backpack includes a small
      weapons rack. The rack holds up to four weapons, such as battleaxes,
      longswords, maces, or short swords. Allies adjacent to you can retrieve a
      weapon from the rack as a move action without provoking attacks of
      opportunity, as if they were simply drawing a weapon. Like a normal
      backpack, it can hold 2 cubic feet of material in its main
      compartment.</p>
