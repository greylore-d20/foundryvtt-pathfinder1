    "shortDescription": "<p>You create a <i>+1 longsword</i> of pure force sized appropriately for you that you can wield or give to another creature like any other longsword. At 8th level, the sword functions as a <i>+2 longsword</i>. At 13th level, it functions as a <i>+3 longsword</i>. A <i>force sword</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it.  If a creature you attack with the sword has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>force sword</i> strikes it. If you fail the check, the spell is dispelled. If you succeed, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>"
