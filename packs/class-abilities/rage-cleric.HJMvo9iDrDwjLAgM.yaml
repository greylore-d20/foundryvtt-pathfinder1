  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can enter a fearsome rage, like a barbarian, for a
      number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. At 12th and 16th
      level, you can select one rage power. You cannot select any rage power
      that possesses a level requirement, but otherwise your barbarian level is
      equal to 1/2 your cleric level. These rounds of rage stack with any rounds
      of rage you might have from levels of barbarian.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Destructive Aura power of the Destruction
      Domain.</p>
