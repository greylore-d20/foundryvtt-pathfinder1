  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you are constantly surrounded by ephemeral and invisible
      strands of aether, increasing your awareness of your surroundings. You are
      never denied your Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks made within 30
      feet of you because you are flat-footed or because your assailant is
      unseen. In addition, you gain a bonus on Perception checks to avoid being
      surprised equal to half your wizard level.</p>
