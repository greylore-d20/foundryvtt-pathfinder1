  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You place a curse upon a creature, causing it to avoid the sight of a
    specific trigger, which is a kind of creature, object, or condition
    designated by you. When the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and is
    aware of the trigger, it gains the sickened condition and feels an urge to
    leave. A successful Will save negates the urge to leave, but the sickened
    condition persists as long as the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and
    aware of it. Example triggers include beggars, filthy clothing, diseased
    creatures, the king, blood, spiders, rats, corpses, and sewage.</p>
