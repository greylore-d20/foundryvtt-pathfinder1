    value: >-
      <p>As any scholar of Desnan lore or astrologer can tell you, the music of
      the spheres is the harmonic constant that plays under and through all of
      reality. It is this constant song, this otherworldly music, that keeps the
      laws of reality constant and the connections between the planes of
      existence strong.</p><p>With this spell, one can amplify the underlying
      music of the spheres in the spell's area of effect to infuse yourself and
      all creatures within 20 feet of you, friend and foe alike. All creatures
      that begin their turn within the area of this spell's effect gain fast
      healing 5, resistance 10 to all energy types, and a +3 sacred bonus on all
      saving throws against poison and disease. Any creature that enters the
      area of effect does not gain the benefits of the music of the spheres
      until it begins its turn in that area. You must maintain concentration on
      the amplification of the music or the effects immediately end, but you can
      move around to prevent enemies from gaining the benefits of this
      spell.</p>
