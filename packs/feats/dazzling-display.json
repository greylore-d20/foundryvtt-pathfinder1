      "value": "<em>Your skill with your favored weapon can frighten enemies.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Weapon Focus, proficiency with the selected weapon.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>While wielding the weapon in which you have Weapon Focus, you can perform a bewildering show of prowess as a full-round action. Make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who can see your display.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>When wielding a melee weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you can make a single melee attack as a standard action against a foe. If the attack hits, you can select any number of foes within 30 feet who saw the attack, including that foe. Spend 2 stamina points per foe you have selected, then attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize those foes."
