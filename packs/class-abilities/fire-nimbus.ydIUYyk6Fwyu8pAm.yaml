    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to gain a nimbus of fire.
      Though this doesn’t harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit
      light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from
      concealment or invisibility. The target also takes a –2 penalty on saving
      throws against spells or effects that deal fire damage. The fire nimbus
      lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s level. A successful
      Will saving throw negates this effect.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the
      target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
