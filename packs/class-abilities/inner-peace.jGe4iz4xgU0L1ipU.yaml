  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the cavalier has learned that while not all things in the
      world will go as he wishes, he must remain calm and centered. Once per day
      as an immediate action, the cavalier may ignore an amount of damage from a
      single source (one attack, spell, or effect) equal to his cavalier level
      plus his Charisma modifier. He can only ignore hit point damage in this
      fashion. The cavalier can use this ability one additional time per day at
      12th level and every four levels thereafter (to a maximum of four times
      per day at 20th level).</p>
