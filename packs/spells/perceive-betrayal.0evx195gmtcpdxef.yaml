    value: >-
      <p>By donning a silver circlet anointed with blood, you gain the ability
      to sense traitorous intent toward a single person to whom you defer,
      designated when you cast the spell. The spell alerts you when a creature
      with traitorous intent is within 200 feet, although it doesn’t identify
      the source. By concentrating, you can learn the strength of the greatest
      threat, based on the following categories.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ill
      Will</strong>: Someone dislikes your liege, but isn’t planning to act
      against her.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plotting</strong>: Someone is actively
      conspiring against your liege.</p></li><li><p><strong>Imminent</strong>:
      Someone is in the process of carrying out a plot against your
      liege.</p></li></ul><p>Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting or
      thought-detecting effects cannot have their intent detected by perceive
      betrayal.</p>
