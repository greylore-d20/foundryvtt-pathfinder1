  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist
      learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these
      exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their
      essence to her arcane reservoir.</p>

      <p>At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new
      arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit
      cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been
      selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the
      arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function.</p>

      <p>Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is
      equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist’s level + the arcanist’s Charisma
      modifier.</p>
