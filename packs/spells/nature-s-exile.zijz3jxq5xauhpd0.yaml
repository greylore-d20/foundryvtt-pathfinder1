  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell curses the creature touched, making it inimical to the
      natural world. All animals have an initial attitude of hostile toward the
      target. Familiars, being magical beasts, are not affected by this spell,
      but animal companions are. If you have an animal companion, it does not
      become hostile, but as long as you remain cursed, your animal companion
      takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws.
      The target also takes a -10 penalty on Survival skill checks as the
      weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause
      trouble.</p><p>Nature's exile can be removed with <i>break
