  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.uab18yhecv8djvbg]{auditory
    hallucination}, except that you can include the image of any object,
    creature, or force you imagine or identify for the targets to imagine. You
    can move the image while you concentrate. After you cease concentration, you
    can define simple movements or changes for the phantasm to perform that can
    be explained in 25 words or fewer.  The image disappears when struck by an
    opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately or instruct it
    to do so. Its AC is equal to 10 + the level of this spell.</p>
