  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You invigorate your allies, who can hustle (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 170) as
    long as you continue to sing or chant (which requires your concentration).
    This movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing
    nonlethal damage and fatigue. You can concentrate on this spell and hustle
    at the same time.</p>
