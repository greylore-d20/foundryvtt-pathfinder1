    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack
      that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this
      intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target
      takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving
      throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler’s level + the higher of the brawler’s
      Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each
      round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw
      to end the effect as a fullround action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are
      immune to this ability.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th
      level, she may use it three times per day.</p>
