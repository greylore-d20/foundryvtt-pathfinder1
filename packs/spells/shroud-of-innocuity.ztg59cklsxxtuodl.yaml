  shortDescription: >-
    <p>All affected creatures are veiled with a commonplace appearance. This
    appearance varies based on the viewer, but is always an ordinary member of
    that viewer's race, ethnicity, or nationality. This familiarity grants a +2
    bonus on Diplomacy checks attempted by affected targets against those not
    affected by the spell.  Creatures with an attitude of unfriendly or hostile
    toward an affected target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect
    the first time they encounter that target.</p>
