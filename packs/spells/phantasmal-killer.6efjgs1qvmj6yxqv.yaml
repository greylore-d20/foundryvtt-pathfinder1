    value: >-
      <p>You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable
      to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious
      mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most
      horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the <i>phantasmal
      killer</i>. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save
      to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches
      the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from
      fear.</p><p>Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes
      3d6 points of damage.</p><p>If the subject of a <i>phantasmal killer</i>
      attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a
      <i>helm of telepathy</i>, the beast can be turned upon you. You must then
      disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.</p>
