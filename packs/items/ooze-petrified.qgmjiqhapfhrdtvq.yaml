      <p>This tiny blob of <em>ooze</em> looks like a small disc of green stone
      when inactive, and is stored in a circular dish with an airtight cover.
      When the cover is removed and the <em>ooze</em> is exposed to air, the
      user has 1 minute to handle the rapidly softening <em>ooze</em> before it
      regains its former viscosity (as well as toxicity) and springs back to
      life. Although much smaller than an actual <em>ooze</em> creature, this
      coin-sized blob still deals 1d6 points of acid damage to anything it comes
      in contact with. Due to its unpredictable nature, <em>petrified</em>
      <em>ooze</em> is typically only good for breaking or melting whatever
      object or device on which the user originally sets the ooze, after which
      the blob quickly scurries into the nearest corner or crevice so it can
      feed on particles of dust and diminutive prey. Once restored to its
      viscous form, a <em>petrified</em> <em>ooze</em> moves at a rate of 60
      feet per round, and any creature that comes in contact with the
      <em>ooze</em> must succeed at a DC 12 <em>Reflex</em> save to avoid taking
      acid damage from it.</p>
