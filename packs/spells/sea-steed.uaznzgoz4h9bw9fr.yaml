      <p>The target adapts to life in the water, gaining piscine scales that
      cover its body and growing fins in place of feet. It gains the aquatic
      subtype, the amphibious quality, and a swim speed equal to its base speed
      before it came under the effect of this spell. While under the effects of
      this spell, the target's base speed is reduced by 10 feet (minimum 10
      feet).</p>
