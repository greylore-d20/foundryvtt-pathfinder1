      <strong>Special</strong> -</p><h3>Description</h3><p>While powered down,
      this sturdy, 2-foot truncheon functions as a light mace. Once it is
      activated (this is a swift action that consumes 1 charge), a high-density
      power core housed in the weapon's head generates a high-pitched whine that
      causes momentary disorientation in a creature struck. Each time the weapon
      hits a target, it consumes 1 charge and the creature struck must succeed
      at a DC 12 Fortitude save or suffer trauma to its central nervous system.
      For 1 round, a creature that fails its saving throw takes a -1 penalty on
      attack rolls, skill checks, and Will saving throws, as well as a -4
      penalty on concentration checks. The duration of this effect stacks with
      multiple hits from the neural inhibitor. This is a mind-affecting
      effect.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 20;
