    value: >-
      <p>While the barbarian is raging, any morale bonuses or bonuses for
      flanking she gains on attacks rolls are added to her damage rolls instead
      of her attack rolls. They are still morale bonuses, and they donâ€™t stack
      with other morale bonuses on damage rolls.</p>
