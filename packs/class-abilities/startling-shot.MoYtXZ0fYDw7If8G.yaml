  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a standard
      action to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a
      firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes flat-footed until the
      start of its next turn.</p>
