  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can transform your body into pure life
      energy, resembling a golden-white fire elemental. In this form, you gain
      the elemental subtype and give off a warm, welcoming light that increases
      the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. Any undead
      creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal
      damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of positive
      energy damage + 1 point per oracle level. Creatures wielding melee weapons
      with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. If you
      grapple or attack an undead creature using unarmed strikes or natural
      weapons, you may deal this damage in place of the normal damage for the
      attack.</p>

      <p>Once per round, if you pass through a living allied creature's square
      or the ally passes through your square, it heals 1d6 hit points + 1 per
      oracle level. You may use this ability to heal yourself as a move action.
      You choose whether or not to heal a creature when it passes through your
      space. You may return to your normal form as a free action. You may remain
      in energy body form for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle
      level.</p>
