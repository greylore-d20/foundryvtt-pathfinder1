    value: >-
      <p>A cone of tiny, sparkling slivers as hard and sharp as filed diamonds
      springs from your outstretched fingers at tremendous speed. Any creature
      in the area of the torrent takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per caster
      level (maximum 10d6). These magical slivers are treated as adamantine and
      cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition,
      this spell bypasses up to 1 point of an object's hardness per 2 caster
      levels (maximum 10).</p>
