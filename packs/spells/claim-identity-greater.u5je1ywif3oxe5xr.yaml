  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as per
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.6rs8aoks1cqkr6o5]{claim identity}, except it
    transforms its target into a helpless, inanimate porcelain mask for the
    spell's duration. The target remains aware of everything it can see or hear
    while transformed. The target can't speak or move, but can still take purely
    mental actions (such as casting certain spells) or be targeted by spells
    that affect its mind. Any creature donning this mask is transformed into a
    flawless imitation of the spell's target, as if affected by <em>claim
    identity</em>, and reverts to its natural form upon removing the mask. Any
    damage dealt to the mask immediately ends this spell.</p>
