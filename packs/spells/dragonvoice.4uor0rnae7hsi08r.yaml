  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By magically altering the way your vocal cords create sounds, you can
      emulate the vocal inflections of dragons. This grants a +6 circumstance
      bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-related skill checks when dealing
      with dragons.  In addition, your voice is much louder than normal, halving
      the penalties to others' Perception checks to hear you due to distance,
      intervening doors, and so on.</p>
