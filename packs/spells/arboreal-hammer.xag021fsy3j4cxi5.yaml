  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell animates a tree's branch and directs it against your foes.
      At caster level 10th or lower, you can target a Huge tree. At caster level
      11th-15th, you can target a Gargantuan tree, and at caster level 16th or
      higher you can target a Colossal tree. The animated branch makes slam
      attacks with a Strength score equal to 10 + your caster level. The branch
      strikes once per round with an attack bonus equal to your caster level +
      the branch's Strength modifier, adjusted by the appropriate size modifier
      (-2 for Huge, -4 for Gargantuan, -8 for Colossal). A Huge tree's slam
      deals 2d6 points of damage, a Gargantuan tree's slam deals 3d6 points of
      damage, and a Colossal tree's slam deals 4d6 points of damage; the tree
      adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to this damage. A Huge tree has
      reach 15 feet, a Gargantuan has reach 20 feet, and a Colossal has reach 30
      feet. The tree attacks the creature you designate when you cast the spell,
      and is unable to move. You can direct the tree against a new target as a
      move action. The tree does not gain a bonus for flanking, nor can it help
      another combatant flank. It cannot attack a foe you cannot see.</p>
