  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can fill an area with the smoky miasma of the Outer Rifts. Once per
      day when you cast a spell that has an area, as a swift action you may also
      fill that area with a thick haze that acts as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.tuh5vc2bojaws3ig]{Obscuring Mist}, except it
      originates at the center of your spell effect and cannot expand beyond the
      spellâ€™s area.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, the haze functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud}.</p>

      <p>You may use this ability one additional time per day at 7th level, and
      one additional time per day at 14th level.</p>
