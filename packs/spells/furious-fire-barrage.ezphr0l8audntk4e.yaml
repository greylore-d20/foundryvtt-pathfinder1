      <p>Upon casting this spell, you conjure forth one or two balls of flame,
      each resting in a free hand. As part of casting this spell or as a
      standard action, you can throw one flame ball a maximum of 300 feet,
      dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level you have (maximum 10d6)
      to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius spread.  So long as the spell's
      duration lasts, you can channel your anger as a full-round action to
      create one new ball of flame, which can be thrown as a standard action.
      You cannot create additional balls of flame while you are under the
      effects of a <i>calm emotions</i> spell or are otherwise unable to feel
      anger or outrage.</p>
