This <em>plant's</em> unsettlingly <em>humanoid</em>-shaped tuber-like roots increase fertility and vitality. Gather DC 20; <b>Yield</b> 1d4 doses</p>\r\n<p><b>Terrain</b> any plains or swamps</p>\r\n<p><b>Preparation</b> A bloody mandrake must be pulped so that its sticky red sap can be gathered, skimmed, and then refined into an even stickier paste; this process requires a successful DC 15 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check and 1d4 hours of work per yield.</p>\r\n<p><b>Use</b> One dose of bloody mandrake paste smeared on the lips (this is a <em>free action</em>) during spellcasting can be used as an additional material component when casting spells that remove afflictions and conditions or that provide a <em>morale bonus</em>. Doing so grants a +1 bonus to the spell's effective <em>caster level</em>.</p>\r\n"
