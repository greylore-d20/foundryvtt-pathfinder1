  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift
      action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much
      by the shifter’s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The
      claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4
      points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses
      one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand,
      the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead.<p>As the shifter
      gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws
      ignore DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw
      damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage
      increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases
      to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase,
      but the critical multiplier becomes ×3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws
      ignore DR/adamantine and DR/—.<p>While a shifter uses wild shape to assume
      her aspect’s major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits
      granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw
      attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the
      damage of the form’s claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not
      have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would
      deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks
      instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws.</p>
