      <p>At 8th level, you receive divine guidance on the goals of your
      political allies and rivals. Once per day, you can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.p2kosvizylhy8vfa]{Commune} as a spell-like ability
      using your inquisitor level as your caster level, but only to ask
      questions about othersâ€™ goals.</p>
