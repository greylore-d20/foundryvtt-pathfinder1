      charges</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A lock coder is a bulky device capable
      of encoding an access card (see page 39) with the capability to open
      specific electronic locks of a rating equal to or lower than its own. The
      device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color
      code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A
      lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color.
      Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful
      Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an
      electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color
      code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required
      to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock
      coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't
      timeworn. An e-pick (see page 43) can be used with a lock coder to
      increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an
      e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians. See
      page 5 for more information on how the Disable Device skill works in
      regard to
      technology.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Encode</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Brown</td><td>DC
