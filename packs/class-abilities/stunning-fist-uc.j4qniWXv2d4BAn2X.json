      "value": "<p>At 1st level, the monk gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.GsjouI6B8X7BA5wN]{Stunning Fist} as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.</p><p>At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his <em>Stunning Fist</em>. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect.</p><p>At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued.</p><p>At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute.</p><p>At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target.</p><p>At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds.</p><p>The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by <em>Stunning Fist</em> cannot become exhausted if hit by <em>Stunning Fist</em> again), but additional hits do increase the duration.</p>"
