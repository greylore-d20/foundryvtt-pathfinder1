      "value": "<p>This discovery is popular among necromancers and necrologists alike; aside from its offensive potential, necrologists sometimes use it to turn uncooperative live creatures they wish to question into pliable undead. The alchemistâ€™s bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, and creatures that take a direct hit from a boneshard bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of bleed damage in addition to normal damage. If a creature is killed by a boneshard bomb or the resulting bleed effect, its corpse immediately reanimates as an undead creature with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Human%20Skeleton\">skeleton template</a>. Skeletons that are created in this manner count as undead created by @Compendium[pf1.spells.8uwmrygxgih1fb57]{Animate Dead}&nbsp;for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must possess the alchemical zombie discovery to select this discovery.</p>"
