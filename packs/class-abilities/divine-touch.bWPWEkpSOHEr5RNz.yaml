  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, an omdura can deliver divine energy by touch. She can
      deliver either positive energy or negative energy. A good omdura (or a
      neutral omdura of a good deity) must select positive energy. An evil
      omdura (or a neutral omdura of an evil deity) must select negative energy.
      An omdura who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor
      evil can select either positive or negative energy. This choice is made
      when the omdura gains this ability and cannot be changed.</p>

      <p>Each day the omdura can use this ability a number of times equal to
      half her omdura level plus her <em>Charisma</em> modifier. With one use of
      this ability, an omdura can use divine energy to restore to a target 1d6
      <em>hit points</em> for every 2 omdura levels she has. Using this ability
      is a <em>standard action</em>, unless the omdura targets herself, in which
      case it is a <em>swift action</em>. An omdura who delivers negative energy
      with her <em>touch</em> can instead deal 1d6 points of damage to a living
      creature for every 2 omdura levels she has. Alternatively, an omdura can
      use this divine energy to affect <em>undead</em> creatures, dealing damage
      when delivering positive energy or restoring <em>hit points</em> when
      delivering negative energy.</p>

      <p>An omdura needs only one freehand to use this ability. Using divine
      touch to harm a creature requires a successful melee <em>touch attack</em>
      and doesnâ€™t provoke an <em>attack of opportunity</em>. Creatures do not
      receive a saving throw against the damage from divine touch. Divine touch
      is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the
      <em>lay on hands</em> <em>paladin</em> class feature. For example, the
      <em>Extra Lay On Hands</em> feat grants an omdura two additional uses of
      the divine touch class feature.</p>
