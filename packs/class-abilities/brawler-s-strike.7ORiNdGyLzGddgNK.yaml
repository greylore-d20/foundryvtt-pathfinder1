    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, a brawler’s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

      <p>At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and
      silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

      <p>At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil,
      good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the
      purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot
      be the opposite of the brawler’s actual alignment, such as a good brawler
      choosing evil strikes.)</p>

      <p>At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine
      weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing
      hardness.</p>
