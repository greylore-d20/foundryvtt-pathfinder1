  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make
      the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood,
      commanding unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still
      others seek to meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might
      of innate casters. These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of
      magic and through will and expertise bend those forces to their whims.
      Arcanists are the shapers and tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic
      can resist their control.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Arcanists are
      scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of
      magic to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy
      of such magic for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless,
      more concerned with the potency of magic than the ramifications of
      unleashing such power.</p><p><strong>Parent Classes</strong>:
      <em>Sorcerer</em> and <em>wizard</em>.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The
      arcanistâ€™s class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex),
      Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft
      (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>
