      "value": "<p>The alchemist knows how to make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/EquipmentMisc.aspx?Category=Tincture\">tinctures</a>&nbsp;that last much longer than normal. The durations of the effects of any tinctures the alchemist brews using the Craft skill are doubled. When the alchemist uses this discovery to brew a longer-lasting tincture, the tincture imposes its normal penalties on the alchemist even if the alchemist has an ability that reduces tincturesâ€™ penalties (such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Alchemist%20Fermenter\">substance tolerance ability of the fermenter alchemist archetype</a>&nbsp;presented in this section). An alchemist with this discovery can brew tinctures with normal durations.</p>"
