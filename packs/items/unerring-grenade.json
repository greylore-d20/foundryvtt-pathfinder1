An unerring grenade can be lit as a move action and thrown like a splash weapon. An unerring grenade veers toward its target, whether a creature or a grid intersection, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. The thrower still has to aim at the right square or grid intersection. An&nbsp;unerring grenade&nbsp;otherwise functions as a normal fuse grenade (Reflex DC 16 half).</p>\n<h3>Construction</h3>\n<p>Requirements&nbsp;Craft Magic Arms and Armor,&nbsp;true seeing;&nbsp;Price&nbsp;186 gp</p>"
