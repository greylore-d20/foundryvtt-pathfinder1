  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Whispering in the dense, information-rich machine language of the First
    Ones, you bring a destroyed construct back to operational status for a short
    time, restoring it to 1 hit point. The construct can be further healed with
    spells like <i>make whole</i>, but it returns to its destroyed state as soon
    as this spell's duration expires or it is brought to 0 hit points, whichever
    comes first. As long as the construct is active, it obeys your commands to
    the best of its ability, fighting on your behalf and carrying out tasks that
    it is capable of performing.</p><p>Constructs with more than twice as many
    Hit Dice as your caster level cannot be targeted by this spell.</p>
