      <p>This small metal rod has a tiny sharp wheel on one end and a bulb on
      the other. You score the glass with the wheel and tap it with the bulb to
      break it. If you succeed at a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check, you can break
      the glass very quietly (DC 15 <em>Perception</em> check to hear). Most
      thieves use <em>glue paper</em> with a <em>glass cutter</em> to reduce
      noise and capture glass fragments.</p>
