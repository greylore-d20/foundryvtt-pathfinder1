    value: >-
      <p>Your ever-changing nature allows you to misdirect aura-reading
      divinations with ease. You are constantly under the effects of a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.8nrt26t37v7koqr8]{Misdirection} spell, except that
      you can take a standard action to select a creature or object within 60
      feet to serve as the target of detection spells used against you until you
      select a different creature or object.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
