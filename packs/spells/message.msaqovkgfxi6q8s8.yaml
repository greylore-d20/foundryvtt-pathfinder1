      <p>You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies.</p><p>Those
      nearby can hear these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point
      your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you
      whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within
      range.</p><p>Magical <i>silence,</i> 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common
      metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the
      spell.</p><p>The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It
      can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the
      subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The
      creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The
      spell transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn't transcend language
      barriers. To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper.</p>
