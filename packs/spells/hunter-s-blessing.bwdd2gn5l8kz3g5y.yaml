    <b>Target</b>s of the spell gain a +2 sacred bonus on Bluff, Perception,
    Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against creatures of the
    selected type, and a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made
    against creatures of that type. Furthermore, they gain a +2 sacred bonus on

    creature type in the chosen terrain, the targets can follow the tracks of
    such creatures untrained, even if the DC for the task is 11 or higher.</p>
