      <p>This dish is a meaty pudding made of sheep organs (mainly heart, liver,
      and lungs) minced with onion, oats, fat, spices, and salt, wrapped in a
      sheep stomach and slow-cooked. Though its ingredients discourage cautious
      eaters, fans of haggis consider it a hearty meal with a wonderful texture.
      It is usually served with turnips, potatoes, and whiskey.</p>
