      Groups</b> Flails</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This weapon consists of one or
      two spherical weights attached by a 10-foot chain. You whirl the weights
      and wrap them around an opponent's body. If you succeed at a trip attempt
      with a meteor hammer, you can drag your opponent 5 feet closer to you
      rather than knocking her prone. You may use this weapon in two different
      ways: In meteor mode you use it as a double weapon, while in fortress mode
      you cannot use it as a double weapon but gain reach and a +1 shield bonus
      to AC. Switching between these two modes is a free action decided at the
      start of your turn.</p>
