    value: >-
      <p>A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to
      present a paradox, riddle, or complicated question to a creature within 30
      feet. The creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monkâ€™s
      level + his Wisdom modifier) or be confused for 1 round. This is a
      mind-affecting, language-dependent effect.</p>

      <p>A monk must be at least 8th level before selecting this ki power.</p>
