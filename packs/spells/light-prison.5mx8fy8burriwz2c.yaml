      <p>Rays of light burst forth from your outstretched hand, encircling each
      target's space with a cage of light. If a target fails its Reflex save, it
      becomes enclosed in the <i>light prison</i>. A creature enclosed in a
      <i>light prison</i> can attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally as
      long as it stays within the <i>light prison</i>. However, if a creature
      passes through the walls of a <i>light prison</i> enclosing it, it takes
      1d6 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round.</p><p>Creatures do not
      receive saves to negate these effects. Once a creature passes through the
      walls of a <i>light prison</i> surrounding it, the effect ends for that
      creature.</p>
