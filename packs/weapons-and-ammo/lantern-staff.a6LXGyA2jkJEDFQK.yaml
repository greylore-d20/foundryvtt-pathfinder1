  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This long metal staff has reservoirs for lamp oil, and a lantern-like
      structure at its head. The lantern staff is fueled as and provides light
      as a hooded lantern. While lit, attacks with the lantern staff deal 1
      point of fire damage in addition to the normal damage. Any effects that
      apply to a quarterstaff, except those that require it be used as a double
      weapon, also apply to a lantern staff.</p>
