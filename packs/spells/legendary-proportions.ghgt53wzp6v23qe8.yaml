  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You call upon the primordial power of ancient megafauna to boost the size
    of your target. Because of its connection to living creatures of the distant
    past, the spell does not function on outsiders, undead, and summoned
    creatures. Your target grows to legendary proportions, increasing in size by
    one category. The creature's height doubles and its weight increases by a
    factor of 8. The target gains a +6 size bonus to its Strength score and a +4
    size bonus to its Constitution score. It gains a +6 size bonus to its
    natural armor, and DR 10/adamantine. Its carrying capacity changes to
    reflect its new size. The creature's equipment and weapons, if any, also
    increase in size. Any enlarged item that leaves the creature's possession
    returns to its original size (though thrown weapons and ammunition deal
    damage at their enlarged size before returning to their true proportions). 
    If insufficient room is available to accommodate the creature's growth, it
    attains the maximum possible size and can attempt a Strength check (using
    its increased Strength score) to burst any  enclosures in the process. If it
    fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it. The
    spell cannot crush a creature by enclosing it.</p>
