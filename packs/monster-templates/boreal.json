These boreal creatures mostly resemble members of their kind that dwell in more temperate climates, but their fur and skin are much paler, and it is not uncommon for parts of these creatures to be cloaked in frost.<br><br><br><strong>Challenge Rating: </strong>Same as the base creature +1.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature gains the cold subtype. If this subtype is applied to a creature with the animal or vermin type, the creature’s type changes to magical beast. Do not recalculate its Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Attacks:</strong> A boreal creature’s natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Abilities: </strong>Str +2, Con +2.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Skills:</strong> The creature receives a +4 bonus on Stealth and Survival checks in snow. An aquatic boreal creature receives a +4 racial bonus on Stealth and Survival checks at all times in frigid waters (its natural habit), instead of in snow.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Environment: </strong>The creature’s natural environment changes to a cold climate.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A boreal creature gains the following special quality.</p>\n<p><br><em>Trackless Step (Ex):</em> A boreal creature does not leave a trail in snow and cannot be tracked. It can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires. This special quality does not apply to aquatic boreal creatures.</p>"
