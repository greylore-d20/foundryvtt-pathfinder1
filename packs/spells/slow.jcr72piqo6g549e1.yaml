      <p>An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically
      <i><i>slow</i>ed</i> rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered
      and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but
      not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1
      penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A <i><i>slow</i>ed</i>
      creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot
      increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for
      decreased speed.</p><p>Multiple <i>slow</i> effects don't stack.
      <i>Slow</i> counters and dispels <i>haste</i>.</p>
