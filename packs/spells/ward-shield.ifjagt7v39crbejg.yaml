    value: >-
      <p>With a touch, you enchant a shield and enable it to protect its wielder
      from hostile spells. The shield grants spell resistance 10 + your caster
      level against spells so long as the shield can be interposed between the
      wielder and the spell effect. A <i>spell shield</i> does not provide spell
      resistance against area effect spells such as <i>fireball</i>, but does
      provide a +5 bonus on Reflex saving throws against such spells.</p>
