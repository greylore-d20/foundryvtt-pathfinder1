  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monk within armâ€™s reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent by
      expending 1 point from his ki pool. When he uses this ability, he takes no
      damage from the fall (as if using feather fall), but he must be adjacent
      to a wall for the length of the fall (although this can be used to reduce
      the damage from a fall if only part of it is adjacent to a wall).</p>
