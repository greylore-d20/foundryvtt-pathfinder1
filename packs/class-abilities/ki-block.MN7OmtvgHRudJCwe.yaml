  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this trick/talent can prevent a creature from using
      its ki pool. Whenever the character deals sneak attack damage, the target
      must make a Will save or be unable to spend any points from its ki pool
      for a number of rounds equal to the characters's Charisma modifier. The DC
      of this save is 10 + 1/2 the character's class level + the character's
      Charisma modifier. The number of points in the target's ki pool is
      unaffected, and abilities that do not require the subject to spend ki
      still function.</p>
