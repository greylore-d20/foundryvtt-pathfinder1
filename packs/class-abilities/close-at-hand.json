      "value": "<p>At 8th level, when the cavalier is within 30 feet of his ward, he gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. If his ward is captured, stolen, or otherwise in the possession or control of the cavalierâ€™s enemies, the cavalier loses these benefits. In their place, he gains the effects of a @Compendium[pf1.spells.tcnirpnzjdaym1fd]{Locate Object}&nbsp;or @Compendium[pf1.spells.4ya1fs9tyvsqnwqx]{Status}&nbsp;spell (depending on the nature of his ward) targeting his ward and lasting 24 hours. When moving toward his ward, the cavalier and his mount increase their speed by 10 feet. At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonus on attack and damage rolls and on saving throws increases by 1 and the bonus to speed increases by 5 feet.</p>"
