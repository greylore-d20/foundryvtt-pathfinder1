  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice--highly
      nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible
      after 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by
      casting a <i>purify food and water</i> spell on it. The water created by
      this spell is just like clean rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the
      food does.</p>
