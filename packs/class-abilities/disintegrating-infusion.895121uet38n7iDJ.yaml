      Fortitude partial; see text</p>

      <p>You can use force to rip your targets apart. Against creatures, your
      kinetic blast deals double its normal amount of damage, but targets
      receive a saving throw to reduce the damage to half the blast’s normal
      amount of damage (for a total of 1/4 of the blast’s increased damage). Any
      creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by the blast is disintegrated,
      as the spell disintegrate.</p>

      <p>You can use the infused blast to destroy force effects or objects as
      disintegrate, but for each force effect or 10-foot cube of nonliving
      matter you destroy in this way, you must accept 1 point of burn, which
      can’t be reduced by effects such as infusion specialization or gather
      power.</p>
