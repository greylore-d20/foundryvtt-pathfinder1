  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast an <em>evocation</em> spell that does acid, cold,
      electricity, or fire damage, you may change the damage dealt to one of the
      other four energy types. This changes the descriptor of the spell to match
      the new energy type. Any non-damaging effects remain unchanged unless the
      new energy type invalidates them (an
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.t1uhggjfimtabp4v]{Ice Storm} that deals fire damage
      might still provide a penalty on <em>Perception</em> checks due to smoke,
      but it would not create difficult terrain). Such effects are subject to GM
      discretion. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3
      + your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>
