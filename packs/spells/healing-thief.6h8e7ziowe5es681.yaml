  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With this spell you can steal the healing of the target creature. You
      must succeed at a melee touch attack to strike the target. If you do,
      until the effect ends, whenever your target is subject to a healing spell
      or a supernatural effect that heals hit points, the target only receives
      half the healing (rounded down) and you receive the other half (also
      rounded down). You must remain within 25 feet (plus 5 feet per two caster
      levels) of the target to gain this benefit. If you move outside that
      range, the spell is discharged. Once you steal 5 hit points per your
      caster level (maximum 50 hit points) of healing from this spell's effect,
      the spell is discharged.</p>
