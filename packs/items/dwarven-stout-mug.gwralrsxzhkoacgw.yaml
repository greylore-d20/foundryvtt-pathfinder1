      <p>More a family of beers than one single drink, dwarven stout is known by
      different names in human lands. Dwarven stouts are dark beers
      characterized by a slightly burnt flavor and a foamy head; they are said
      to be as filling as a meal. Most dwarven clans use a recipe unique to that
      clan, and family rivalries over the best brew may date back for hundreds
      of years.</p>
