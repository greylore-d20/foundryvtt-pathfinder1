  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause the target to become invisible and silent, but only to his
    allies. Any creature with an attitude of indifferent or worse toward the
    target, and any creature that wishes the target harm, can see the target
    normally. The target can see and hear himself, can cast spells with verbal
    components, and can use command words normally, but any effect that requires
    allies to see or hear the target does not function. An ally that can see
    invisible creatures can both see and hear the target of <i>isolate</i>.  If
    the target succeeds at its save, the duration of the spell is reduced to 1
    round.</p>
