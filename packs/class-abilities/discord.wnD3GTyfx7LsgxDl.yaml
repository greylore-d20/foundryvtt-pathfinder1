  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can make an animal or humanoid within 30 feet distrust
      another creature within line of sight. The target’s attitude toward the
      other creature decreases by one step. A successful Will save negates this
      effect. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch’s
      Intelligence modifier. The duration can be extended with the cackle hex.
      Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of
      this hex again for 1 day.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, this effect decreases the attitude of the target creature
      by two steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p>
