    value: >-
      <p>You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized
      object.</p><p>You can search for general items, in which case you locate
      the nearest of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to
      find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the
      image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails.</p><p>You
      cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item
      firsthand (not through divination).</p><p>The spell is blocked by even a
      thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. <i>Polymorph
      any object</i> and <i>nondetection</i> fool it.</p>
