This increases the saving throw DCs of your psychic spells by 1, and the increase lasts a number of minutes equal to your psychic level. You must have at least one piece of cybertech (Technology Guide 35) implanted in you to use this ability.</p>\n<p>Additional implants do not increase the duration or the number of uses of this discipline ability.</p>"
