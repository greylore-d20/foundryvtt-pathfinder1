    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create
      a glowing orb of swirling lights that obeys your commands. This orb
      illuminates the area like the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.ip9onjfp6nf1vlv9]{light} spell. The orb
      can be commanded to hover over your shoulder, moving with you. As a move
      action, you can direct it to move up to 30 feet away from you. If the
      light matrix is ever more than 30 feet away from you, it returns to hover
      over your shoulder.</p><p>If you are at least 5th level, you can direct
      the light matrix to make a melee touch attack against one foe within 30
      feet. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or
      be blinded for 1d4 rounds by a flash of light. If the attack hits,
      regardless of whether the target succeeds at the save, the light matrix
      immediately ends. The light matrix otherwise has a duration of 1 hour per
      occultist level you possess.</p><p>You canâ€™t have more than one light
      matrix in existence at one time. If you use this power again, any previous
      light matrices immediately end.</p>
