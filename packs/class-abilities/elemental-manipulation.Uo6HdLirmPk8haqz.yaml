  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that transforms magical
      energy. Choose an energy type from acid, cold, electricity, and fire, and
      a second type to transform it into. Any magical source of energy of this
      type with a <em>caster level</em> equal to or less than your wizard level
      is altered to the chosen energy type. This includes <em>supernatural</em>
      effects from creatures with <em>Hit Dice</em> no greater than your
      <em>caster level</em>. For example, you could transform a <em>white
      dragon’s</em> frigid breath weapon (a <em>supernatural</em> ability), but
      not a <em>fire elemental’s</em> fiery touch (an extraordinary ability). If
      an effect lies only partially within your aura, only the portions within
      the aura are transformed. You can use this ability for a number of rounds
      per day equal to your wizard level. The rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>
