      "value": "<em>You can strike two adjacent foes with a single swing.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Str 13, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>When using the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you can spend 4 stamina points to negate the -2 penalty to Armor Class until your next turn."
