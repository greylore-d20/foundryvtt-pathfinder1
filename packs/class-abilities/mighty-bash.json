      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, the cavalier does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she attacks foes while unarmed so long as she is dealing nonlethal damage. In addition, the cavalier’s unarmed strikes deal more nonlethal damage than usual; she is treated as having a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Monk\">monk levels</a>&nbsp;equal to her cavalier level for the purpose of determining how much nonlethal damage her unarmed strikes deal. For example, a 12th-level cavalier of the order of the hammer would deal 2d6 points of nonlethal damage with her unarmed strike. The cavalier must still select the @Compendium[pf1.feats.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed Strike}&nbsp;feat if she wants to deal lethal damage with her unarmed strike, and lethal damage dealt with her unarmed strike is not increased by this ability.</p>"
