      <p>By touching a creature with a bladed instrument, you cause the
      creature's flesh to loosen and slide against its skeletal moorings. A
      living creature touched becomes staggered by the disturbing and
      uncomfortable sensation for 1 round per level. Each round on its turn, the
      subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a
      standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A corporeal
      undead creature targeted by this spell instead takes 1d6 points of damage
      per caster level (maximum 5d6 at 5th level) as wet, oozing chunks of flesh
      slough off its desiccated bones (a successful Fortitude save halves this
      damage). Incorporeal creatures, or creatures that do not have flesh, are
      immune to this spell's effects.</p>
