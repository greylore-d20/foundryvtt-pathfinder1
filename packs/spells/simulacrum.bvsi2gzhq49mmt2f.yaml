      <p><i>Simulacrum</i> creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The
      duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It
      appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half of the real
      creature's levels or HD (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill
      ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or
      HD).</p><p>You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels
      exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you
      cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is.</p><p>A creature
      familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful
      Perception check (opposed by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense
      Motive check.</p><p>At all times, the simulacrum remains under your
      absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be
      exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more
      powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit
      points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into
      nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit
      point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to a
      simulacrum.</p>
