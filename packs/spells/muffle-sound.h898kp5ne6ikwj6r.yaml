      <p>You suppress sounds made by the targets, granting them a +4 bonus on
      Stealth checks. The targets have a 20% chance of spell failure when
      casting spells with verbal components or using abilities that have audible
      components (such as some bardic performances). This spell does not hamper
      the targets' ability to hear other sounds and provides no protection
      against language-dependent or sonic spells and effects.</p>
