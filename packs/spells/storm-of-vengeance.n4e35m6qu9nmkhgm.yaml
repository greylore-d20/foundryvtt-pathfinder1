      <p>You create a huge black storm cloud in the air. Each creature under the
      cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 x 10
      minutes. Each round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates
      additional effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your
      turn.</p><p><i>2nd Round</i>: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6
      points of acid damage (no save).</p><p><i>3rd Round</i>: You call six
      bolts of lightning down from the cloud.</p><p>You decide where the bolts
      strike. No two bolts may be directed at the same target. Each bolt deals
      10d6 points of electricity damage. A creature struck can attempt a Reflex
      save for half damage.</p><p><i>4th Round</i>: Hailstones rain down in the
      area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save).</p><p><i>5th
      through 10th Rounds</i>: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility.
      The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A
      creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).
      Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the
      attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by
      three-quarters.</p><p>Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are
      impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster
      succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the <i>storm of
      vengeance's</i> save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to
      cast.</p>
