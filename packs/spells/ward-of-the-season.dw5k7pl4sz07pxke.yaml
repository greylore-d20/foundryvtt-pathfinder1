  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell harnesses the power of the seasons to protect the target and
    grant a number of bonuses. This spell has one of four different effects. The
    caster of the spell can select any one of the following four effects, but
    can change the effect as a standard action that reduces the total remaining
    duration by 1 hour. <i>Spring</i>: The target is wrapped in light vines,
    culminating in a crown of bright, beautiful flowers. While the spell remains
    in effect, the target is immune to bleed effects and regains 1 hit point per
    round whenever below 0 hit points, as long as the target is still alive.
    This stabilizes the target. For each hit point restored in this way, the
    spell's total remaining duration is reduced by 1 hour. <i>Summer</i>: The
    target is surrounded by tiny motes of light. While the spell remains in
    effect, the target's base speed increases 10 feet. The target may instead
    increase its base speed by 30 feet for 1 round by reducing the spell's total
    remaining duration by 1 hour. <i>Fall</i>: A cloak of autumn leaves appears
    on the target. While the spell remains in effect, the target gains a +2
    morale bonus on Fortitude saves. The target can decide to roll twice on any
    saving throw against disease or poison and take the higher result by
    reducing the spell's total remaining duration by 1 hour. <i>Winter</i>: A
    flutter of snow and crisp air surrounds the target. While this spell remains
    in effect, the target automatically succeeds at Acrobatics skill checks made
    to avoid falling while moving across slick or narrow surfaces. The target
    can move freely through difficult terrain for 1 round by reducing the
    spell's remaining duration by 1 hour. Difficult terrain created by magic
    affects the target normally.</p>
