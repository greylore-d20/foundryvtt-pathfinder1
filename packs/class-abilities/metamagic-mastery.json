      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can apply any one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\" rel=\"nofollow\">metamagic feat</a>&nbsp;that you know to a spell you are about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every two wizard levels you possess beyond 8th. Any time you use this ability to apply a metamagic feat that increases the spell level by more than 1, you must use an additional daily usage for each level above 1 that the feat adds to the spell. Even though this ability does not modify the spell’s actual level, you cannot use this ability to cast a spell whose modified spell level would be above the level of the highest-level spell that you are capable of casting.</p>"
