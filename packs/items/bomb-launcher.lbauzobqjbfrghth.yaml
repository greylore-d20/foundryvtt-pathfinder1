  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These odd looking, egg-shaped contraptions have cleverly placed fins
      that improve bombs' accuracy. <em>Goblin alchemists</em> use these special
      containers to make their bombs more accurate when thrown long distances.
      Using a bomb launcher when throwing a bomb increases the bomb's range
      increment to 30 feet (or increases the range increment of a bomb with the
      rocket bomb discovery to 70 feet). Bomb launchers are destroyed when
      used.</p>
