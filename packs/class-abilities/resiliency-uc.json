      "value": "<p>Once per day, a rogue with this ability can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice her rogue level. Activating this ability is an immediate action that can be performed only when the rogue is brought to below 0 hit points. This ability can be used to prevent the rogue from dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If the rogueâ€™s hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit points, she falls unconscious and is dying as normal.</p>"
