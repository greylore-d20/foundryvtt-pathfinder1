      <p>This clear resin protects a weapon from harmful attacks from
      <em>oozes</em>, <em>rust monsters</em>, and similar effects that corrode
      or melt weapons, rendering the weapon immune for 24 hours. One pot can
      coat one two-handed weapon, two one-handed or light weapons, or 50
      ammunition items. Applying it takes 1 full round. Immersing the weapon in
      water or similar liquid washes it off.</p><p><strong>Create</strong>:
