  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You call to mind prophecies regarding a person, place, item, or event.
    These might be predictions made in the past, lost to history, or entirely
    new. If the person or item is present or if you are at the desired location,
    the casting time is 1d4×10 minutes; if you have general but specific
    information about the subject, the casting time is 1d4×2 hours. If you have
    only rumors, you cannot cast this spell with any effect.</p><p>More than one
    prophecy can come to mind when you cast this spell, and each are of varying
    detail and accuracy. Roll d% and add your caster level (maximum 10) to
    determine results this spell returns, as listed
    below.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>d%</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>1-25</td><td>Your
    prophecy is vague, difficult to interpret, or does not offer any new
    subjects for further investigation.</td></tr><tr><td>26-50</td><td>You
    divine multiple prophecies for the subject, but you are unsure which
    applies. You have enough information to gain a +5 bonus on Knowledge,
    Perception, and Sense Motive checks about the subject. If you discover more
    information about the subject using these skills, you gain a +10 bonus when
    rolling on this table the next time you cast this spell within 24 hours. You
    can gain this bonus only once in a single 24-hour
    period.</td></tr><tr><td>51-75</td><td>You identify multiple prophecies and
    know which single prophecy is most likely to take effect and which is most
    likely to be false or fraudulent. If no prophecy is accurate, you become
    aware of this. Even accurate prophecies are often vague, and how easy it is
    to determine details from one is up to the
    GM.</td></tr><tr><td>76-100</td><td>You gain accurate visions of a single
    prophecy regarding the subject. You know what this prophecy means and what
    it foretells, it is generally accurate, and it comes in the form of a single
    statement, though the timeline for when the prophecy will come true might be
    vague. (For example, “Flames shall consume it within a month” if the subject
    is a tavern destined to burn, or “The murderer shall be discovered by a
    hero” if the subject is a murder victim.)</td></tr></tbody></table>
