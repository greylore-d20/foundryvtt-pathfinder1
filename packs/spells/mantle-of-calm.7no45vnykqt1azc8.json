    "shortDescription": "<p>You surround yourself with a Mantle of Calm serenity. You take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells you cast. Any creature affected by a <i>rage</i> effect (barbarian's <i>rage</i>,  blood<i>rage</i>r's blood<i>rage</i>, blood <i>rage</i> monster ability, <i>rage</i> spell, skald's inspired <i>rage</i> raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt a Will saving throw, without the <i>rage</i> effect's bonus to Will; failure means the <i>rage</i> effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate).  If you become affected by a <i>rage</i> effect while this spell is active, this spell immediately ends. If your <i>rage</i> effect comes from a skald's raging song, then it ends only for you, and you cannot regain the effects of the song.</p>"
