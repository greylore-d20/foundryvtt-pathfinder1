      <p>You identify the stage of a given soul's judgment, or determine its
      fate post-judgment. You must either unambiguously identify  the soul you
      seek or use the skull of the body the soul vacated as a focus. If the
      subject does not share your alignment, the soul can attempt a Will save to
      resist this spell's effects as if it were still alive. If the subject is
      still alive or its soul has been destroyed, this spell fails without
      providing any information.  If the soul has not yet been judged and moved
      on to its final reward or punishment, <i>soulseeker</i> provides an
      estimate of its location; in most cases, this is somewhere in the River of
      Souls or the Boneyard. While this may assist in physically traveling to
      the soul's location, especially in cases involving effects such as <i>soul
      bind</i> or a devourer's devour soul ability, the spell's primary purpose
      is to identify how long the subject has been dead (and what form of
      life-restoring magic is necessary). If the soul has already been judged,
      <i>soulseeker</i> instead identifies the plane to which the soul has been
      sent as a petitioner and the petitioner's general location on that plane
      (such as "Elysium, beneath the boughs of the Witchwood").  If
      <i>soulseeker</i> is cast on the same plane on which the soul's new
      petitioner form currently exists, it guides you along the shortest, most
      direct physical route to the petitioner, as described in <i>find the
      path</i>. In this case, the spell's duration is 1 hour per level.</p>
