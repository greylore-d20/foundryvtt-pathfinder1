Inside the locket is a small, spring-loaded vial that can hold a single dose of powdered <em>poison</em>. Loading the locket with poison carries the same risks as applying poison to a weapon. When the locket is opened, the vial is shattered by a ball bearing, releasing the powder into the air and treating the poison's type as if it were inhaled. The airborne poison affects all creatures within 10 feet of the locket.</p>"
