      <p>One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he
      became a god, Aroden's <em>spellbane</em> creates an area within which
      spells selected by you simply do not function.</p><p>Select one spell per
      five caster levels at the time of casting.</p><p>The spells selected
      cannot be changed after the spell is cast. Aroden's <em>spellbane</em>
      otherwise functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.niqxt53lhxrjfaty]{antimagic field},
      except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells.
      Only the exact spells mentioned are affected-a <em>spellbane</em> set to
      prevent the casting of summon nature's ally II would not prevent castings
      of summon nature's ally I or summon nature's ally III. If you move into an
      area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is
      in effect, that spell is affected as if by <em>antimagic field</em>. If
      the spell affects a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must
      make a caster level check against the creature's spell resistance to make
      it wink out.</p><p>Aroden's <em>spellbane</em> can even negate an
      <em>antimagic field</em>, another Aroden's <em>spellbane</em>, or any
      spell that specifies immunity to <em>antimagic field</em> (such as
      <em>Wall of Force</em>, <em>prismatic sphere</em>, and <em>prismatic</em>
      wall). Multiple <em>spellbane</em> effects can overlap.</p><p>Their
      effects stack, preventing the functioning of every spell targeted by any
      of the multiple <em>spellbane</em> emanations. Spell effects created by
      artifacts or deities cannot be suppressed by Aroden's
      <em>spellbane</em>.</p>
