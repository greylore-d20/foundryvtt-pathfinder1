      "value": "<p><b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.</p>\n<p>This fluid is used to preserve corpses, whether for later dissection, taxidermy, necromancy, or magic such as raise dead. Embalming fluid is technically a poison, and using it makes a corpse unpalatable to most animals and vermin, though corpse-eating undead don't mind the taste. Treating a corpse with embalming fluid takes 1 hour and a successful DC 25 Heal check. The embalmed corpse decays at half the normal rate (each day dead counts as half a day for the purpose of raise dead).</p>"
