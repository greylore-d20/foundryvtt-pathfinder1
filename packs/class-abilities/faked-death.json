The subject seems to fall down dead (as programmed image), but actually turns invisible (as invisibility) for a number of rounds equal to the mesmeristâ€™s level or until she attacks. Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment; the invisibility is a glamer.</p>"
