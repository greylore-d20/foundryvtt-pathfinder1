  description:

      <p>You dim your targets' perceptions of light and shadow, convincing them
      the space they occupy is dark. Each creature that fails its save perceives
      the world around it as one light level darker than its true illumination
      level. The spell does not change the light level outside of the targets'
      perception, and does not create magical darkness. However, the spell
      creates an illusion of darkness rather than actual darkness, so low-light
      and darkvision don't allow a target to see in the conditions created by
      the spell. Even targets that see normally through magical darkness suffer
      a loss of vision from this spell.</p>
