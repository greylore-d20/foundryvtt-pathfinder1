  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target is surrounded by a glowing green aura of ill fate. Each time
    the spell's subject makes an attack or casts a spell, it must succeed at a
    Will saving throw with a DC = 10 + 1/2 caster level + Charisma (in the case
    of oracles), Intelligence (in the case of witches), or Wisdom (in the case
    of clerics). If it fails the saving throw, it deals half damage with the
    attack or spell. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when the
    target confirms a critical hit; doing so negates the critical hit. The
    attack that you negated still hits, but only deals half damage.</p>
