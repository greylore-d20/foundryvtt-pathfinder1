    value: >-
      <p>A touched creature becomes invisible (as per invisibility) as long as
      it is in direct sunlight (or bright light shed by a <i>daylight</i>
      spell). If an action the target creature takes causes the invisible
      creature to become visible but does not end the <i>sunstalker</i> spell's
      duration, the creature can use this spell's magic to become invisible
      again as a standard action as long as it stands in an area of sunlight (as
      defined above). The creature gains only concealment (20% miss chance) in
      normal light.</p>
