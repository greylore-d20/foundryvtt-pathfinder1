      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>No description provided.<p>“Mutant
      goblin” is an acquired template that can be added to a goblin (referred to
      hereafter as the base creature). A mutant goblin uses the base creature’s
      statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<p><b>CR:</b> Same
      as the base creature + 1.</p>

      <p><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor bonus increases by 4.</p>

      <p><b>Mutations:</b> A mutant goblin gains four of the following
      mutations, determined randomly when it gains the template. For every 5 Hit
      Dice it has (5, 10, and so on), it gains another random mutation. (Other
      possible mutations include tusks, a spiked tail, and gills.)<p><em>Breath
      Weapon (Su): </em>The goblin can spew a line of foul acidic blood from its
      mouth (20-foot line, Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 Hit Die + its Constitution
      modifier for half damage, 1d4 points of acid damage per HD, usable every
      1d4 rounds). If it has 5 or more HD, the range increases to 30 feet and
      the damage increases to 1d6 points of acid damage per HD.</p>

      <p><em>Claws (Ex): </em>The goblin’s hands become claws. It gains a
      natural claw attack for each hand that deals damage appropriate to its
      size, and gains the grab ability with its claws.</p>

      <p><em>Extra Arm (Ex): </em>The goblin gains an extra arm with a
      functional hand, as the vestigial arm discovery. If it gains this mutation
      again, it gains another arm.</p>

      <p><em>Fast Healing (Ex): </em>The goblin gains fast healing 1. If it has
      5 Hit Dice or more, this increases to fast healing 2. If the creature has
      10 HD or more, this increases to fast healing 5.</p>

      <p><em>Venomous Bite (Ex): </em>The mutant goblin grows large fangs,
      gaining a poisonous bite as a natural attack that deals damage appropriate
      to its size. The poison functions like wyvern poison, except its DC is 10
      + 1/2 HD + its Constitution modifier.</p>

      <p><em>Wings (Ex): </em>The goblin gains dragonfly wings, granting it a
      fly speed of 30 feet with clumsy maneuverability.<p><b>Abilities:</b> Str
      +4, Int –2.</p>
