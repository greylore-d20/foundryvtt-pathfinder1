    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the barbarian rages, the light level within 20 feet of her
      lowers by two steps instead of one. She still canâ€™t decrease the light
      level below normal darkness with this ability.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 10th level and have the eclipsing rage
      power to choose this rage power.</p>
