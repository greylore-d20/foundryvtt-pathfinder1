  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>detect thoughts</i> except that you sense
    significant anxieties of creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or
    higher, regardless of whether they are conscious or not.  Instead of
    Intelligence, the second round of concentration reveals each mind's Wisdom
    score and current degree of fear (shaken, frightened, panicked, cowering, or
    paralyzed with fear). If the highest Wisdom score is 26 or higher (and at
    least 10 points higher than your own Wisdom score), you are stunned for 1
    round and the spell ends.  Instead of surface thoughts, the third round of
    concentration reveals the most pressing current anxiety of any mind in the
    area (Will negates).  Presenting a creature with the threat of its anxiety
    grants you a +2 bonus (or higher, at the GM's discretion) on checks to
    Intimidate that creature.</p>
