  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, the occultist learns to draw magic circles very quickly.
      He can draw a magic circle as a full-round action, but any circle drawn in
      this way has a duration of 1 minute per occultist level (unless itâ€™s drawn
      in conjunction with the outside contact class feature, in which case it
      lasts for 10 minutes as normal). If he draws a binding circle in this way,
      its duration is 1 round per occultist level.</p>
