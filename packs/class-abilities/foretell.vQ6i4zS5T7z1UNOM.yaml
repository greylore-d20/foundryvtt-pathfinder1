  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can utter a prediction of the immediate future. While
      your foretelling is in effect, you emit a 30-foot aura of fortune that
      aids your allies or hinders your enemies, as chosen by you at the time of
      prediction. If you choose to aid, you and your allies gain a +2 <em>luck
      bonus</em> on ability checks, attack rolls, <em>caster level</em> checks,
      <em>saving throws</em>, and skill checks. If you choose to hinder, your
      enemies take a â€“2 penalty on those rolls instead. You can use this ability
      for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do
      not need to be consecutive.</p>
