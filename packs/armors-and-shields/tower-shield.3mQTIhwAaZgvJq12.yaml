  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as its user. In most
      situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. As a
      standard action, however, you can use a tower shield to grant you total
      cover until the beginning of your next turn. When using a tower shield in
      this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as
      a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for
      attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not
      pass through this edge (see cover, Core Rulebook 195). The shield does
      not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can
      cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot
      bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything
      else.<p>When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a –2 penalty on
      attack rolls because of the shield’s encumbrance.</p>
