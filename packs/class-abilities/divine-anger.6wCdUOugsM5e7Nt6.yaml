  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to rage like a barbarian. Your
      effective barbarian level for this ability is your inquisitor level â€“ 3.
      If you have levels in barbarian, these levels stack when determining the
      effect of your rage. You do not gain any rage powers from this granted
      power, though if you have rage powers from another class, you may use them
      with these rages. You can rage a number of rounds per day equal to your
      Wisdom bonus, plus 1 round for every inquisitor level above 4th.</p>
