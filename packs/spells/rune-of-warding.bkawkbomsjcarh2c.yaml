    value: >-
      <p>You inscribe a series of runes upon the surface of a door or around the
      border of an entryway. They function as a <i>Glyph of Warding</i> (blast
      glyph), though unlike a <i>Glyph of Warding</i>, these runes are always
      visible. The runes count as a <i>Glyph of Warding</i> for the purpose of
      what spells can defeat it, placing multiple glyphs in the same area, and
      so on.</p>
