    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, as a swift or immediate action, you can inflict a curse
      on any adjacent creature that scores a critical hit against you or deals
      precision damage to you. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or
      be cursed. Select one of the following effects: the target takes a –2
      penalty to one ability score of your choice (the ability cannot be reduced
      below 1); the target takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws,
      ability checks, and skill checks; each turn, the target has a 25% chance
      of taking no action (otherwise, it acts normally). This curse lasts for 1
      hour.</p>

      <p>A creature can be subjected to only one instance of retributive curse
      at a time. This otherwise functions as bestow curse.</p>
