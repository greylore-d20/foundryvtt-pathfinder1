      "value": "<p>The rogue has picked up Sczarni tricks for making masterful forgeries and using bribery to evade trade rules. The rogue needs to learn only the approximate appearance of a document that doesn’t require a particular person’s signature to accurately forge the document with Linguistics (gaining a +8 bonus on the check to create the forgery, as if she had seen a similar document before). The rogue needs only a small sample of a person’s handwriting to make a convincing forgery of great length in that person’s handwriting. The rogue can always take 10 on Diplomacy checks to offer bribes. In addition, the rogue automatically gains an extra advantage at the start of a pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142) in an urban environment.</p>"
