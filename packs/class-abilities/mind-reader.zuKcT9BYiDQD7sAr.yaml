  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you can read minds as a spell-like ability. This ability
      acts like @Compendium[pf1.spells.xllxylvvqr82o2d5]{Detect Thoughts},
      except it lasts only 1 round, you use it on a single target as a
      <em>standard action</em>, and if the target fails its <em>Will</em> save,
      you gain information as if you had concentrated on it for 3 rounds. You
      may use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per
      day for every four sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five
      times per day at 20th level.</p>
