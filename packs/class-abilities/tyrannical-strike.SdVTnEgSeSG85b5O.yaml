  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, as an immediate action upon successfully landing a melee
      attack on an opponent, you can choose to forgo the damage (but not any
      other effects of the attack) to instead affect the creature you hit as per
      a greater command spell, with a caster level equal to your class level.
      You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time
      per day for every 4 levels beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Staff of Order power of the Law Domain.</p>
