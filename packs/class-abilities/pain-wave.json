      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash a wave of pain. This wave hits all creatures other than you in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on a point that you designate within 100 feet. All living creatures in this area are wracked with pain, gaining the sickened condition for 1 round per occultist level you possess. Affected creatures can attempt a Will save to reduce the duration to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting pain effect.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>"
