  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a
      battle ward. The next time a foe makes an attack roll against the target,
      the ward activates and grants a +3 deflection bonus to the warded
      creature’s AC. Each subsequent time she’s attacked, the defection bonus
      reduces by 1 (to +2 for the second time she’s attacked and +1 for the
      third). The ward fades when the bonus is reduced to +0 or after 24 hours,
      whichever comes first.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the ward’s starting bonus increases to +4.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, it increases to +5.</p>

      <p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24
      hours.</p>
