    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you can exude small tendrils of ectoplasm that can be
      used to make melee <em>touch</em> attacks as part of a spell with a range
      of touch. You can make melee <em>touch</em> attacks as if you had an
      additional 5 feet of reach. You must have a free hand with which to direct
      the ectoplasm.</p>

      <p>This ability does not otherwise increase your <em>threatened</em> area.
      At 11th level, this additional reach increases to 10 feet. At 17th level,
