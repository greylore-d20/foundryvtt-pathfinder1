      leather thong that attaches to a standard javelin. Before throwing, the
      amentum is wound about the javelin's shaft. You then throw the javelin
      while gripping the amentum, imparting spin on the weapon and greatly
      improving its range. Attaching an amentum to a javelin is a move action,
      and winding it is a full-round action. Javelins can be stored with amenta
      already wound about them. A javelin wound with an amentum is considered a
      martial weapon.</p>
