    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, you cast your psyche into the void of space to attract
      the attention of a terrible otherworldly being. The dweller in darkness
      behaves in all ways as if you had cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.6efjgs1qvmj6yxqv]{Phantasmal Killer}. At 17th
      level, the dweller in darkness can be perceived by more than one creature,
      as if you had cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.3wdx7fjulsohi1lk]{Weird}.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level to choose this revelation.</p>
