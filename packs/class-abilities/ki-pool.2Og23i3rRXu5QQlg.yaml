  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he
      can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk's ki
      pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his <em>Wisdom</em> modifier. As
      long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki
      strike.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><b>At 4th level</b>, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be
      treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage
      reduction</em>.</li>

      <li><b>At 7th level</b>, his unarmed attacks are also treated as <em>cold
      iron</em> and <em>silver</em> for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage
      reduction</em>.</li>

      <li><b>At 10th level</b>, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful
      weapons for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage reduction</em>.</li>

      <li><b>At 16th level</b>, his unarmed attacks are treated as
      <em>adamantine</em> weapons for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage
      reduction</em> and bypassing <em>hardness</em>.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool, a monk can do one of the
      following:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Make one additional attack at his highest <em>attack bonus</em> when
      making a flurry of blows attack, or</li>

      <li>Increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round, or</li>

      <li>Give himself a +4 <em>dodge bonus</em> to <em>AC</em> for 1
      round.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Each of these powers is activated as a <em>swift action</em>.</p>

      <p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or
      meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>
