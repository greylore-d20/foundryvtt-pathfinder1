      "value": "<p>At 20th level, the oracleâ€™s body takes on the consistency of rock, and her touch carries the heat of a volcano. She gains the fire and earth subtypes and becomes vulnerable to cold. Any fire damage she deals ignores the first 10 points of fire resistance, but not fire immunity. The oracle gains a +4 bonus to natural armor. Her attacks with natural weapons, unarmed strikes, and metal-hafted weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. Any creature that strikes the oracle with a natural weapon or unarmed strike, or that succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check against her, takes 1d6 points of fire damage. This damage stacks with other sources of fire damage. You can suppress or reestablish this heat as a standard action.</p>"
