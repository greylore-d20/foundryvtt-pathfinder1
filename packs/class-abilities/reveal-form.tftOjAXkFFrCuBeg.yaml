  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, you can invoke the
      name of your deity and order one shapechanged target within 30 feet to
      reveal its true form. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2
      your inquisitor level + your Wisdom modifier) or be forced on its next
      turn to dispel any ongoing polymorph effects or innate shapechanging
      abilities to assume its natural form. If a creature affected by this
      ability fails its save and is for some reason unable to dispel any ongoing
      polymorph effects or innate shapechanging abilities, it is instead
      staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>
