    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, your body becomes truly unnatural. You are immune to
      critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, you gain blindsight with a
      range of 60 feet and your bloodrager damage reduction increases by 1. You
      have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.</p>
