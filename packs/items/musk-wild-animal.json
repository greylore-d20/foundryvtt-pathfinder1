      "value": "<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO9410</em></p>\n<p>This emerald-colored adhesive is a concoction made from animal glands, urine, and other powerful scents combined with a strong alchemical binding agent that is difficult to wash off. A target splashed with it smells like weak prey to predators. Creatures with the <em>scent</em> ability can detect a marked creature at five times the normal range, note its direction as a <em>free action</em>, pinpoint it when it is within 25 feet, and track it by scent with a +5 bonus on its <em>Survival</em> checks. Immersion in water within 1 round of exposure washes it off; otherwise the effect decreases by one range increment per day (four times normal range after 1 day, three times range after 2 days, and so on) until the creature is again at normal scent levels.</p>\n<p><b>Create</b>: <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC 20</p>"
