      "value": "<p>The vigilante’s transformation between identities is assisted by magic. This makes it faster than usual, but also more noticeable. The vigilante can complete the switch between his identities in 5 rounds, improving to a standard action if he has the quick change social talent, and to a swift action if he has the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation causes quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions.</p>\n<p>A vigilante can select this talent only if he is able to cast spells or spell-like abilities (this needn’t be from his vigilante class).</p>\n<p>A vigilante with the magical child archetype effectively gets this social talent for free at 1st level.</p>"
