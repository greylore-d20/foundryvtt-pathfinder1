  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You emit a calming subsonic drone that allows the targets to temporarily
    refocus and restore their balance when they're suffering from debilitating
    conditions. A target with the dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or sickened
    condition ignores the penalties of those conditions for the duration of this
    spell. A target with one of the following conditions is treated as having
    the associated lesser condition for the duration of the spell, as shown by
    the following table.</p><p><table border
    ='1'><tr><th>Condition</th><th>Lesser
    Condition</th></tr><tr><td>Blinded</td><td>Dazzled</td></tr><tr><td>Exhausted</td><td>Fatigued</td></tr><tr><td>Frightened</td><td>Shaken</td></tr><tr><td>Nauseated</td><td>Sickened</td></tr></table>
    At the end of the spell's duration, the targets are again subject to the
    appropriate penalties if the original conditions affecting the target are
    still in effect.</p>
