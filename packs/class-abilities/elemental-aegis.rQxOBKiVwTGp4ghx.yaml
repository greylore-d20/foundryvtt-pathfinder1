      <p><strong>Source</strong> Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 28</p><p>When
      you take this revelation, choose one element: air, earth, fire, or water.
      You can conjure an enveloping, protective force made of this element that
      grants you a +4 armor bonus to AC (this manifests as a solid rush of air
      over your body, rocky plates covering your skin, and the like).</p><p>At
      7th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by
      2.</p><p>You can use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This
      duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour
      increments.</p><p>At 13th level, you receive an additional boon depending
      on the element you chose. If you chose air, you gain a +2 bonus on Reflex
      saving throws. If you chose earth, you gain a +2 bonus to CMD. If you
      chose fire, you gain fire resistance 2 (this stacks with any other fire
      resistance you have). If you chose water, you gain a +4 bonus on Swim
      checks.</p>
