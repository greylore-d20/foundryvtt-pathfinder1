    value: >-
      <p>You overlay a realistic illusion of a terrifying hellscape upon an
      area. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden,
      though environmental features take on an infernal appearance. While you
      are prepared for these images and are not affected by them, any other
      creature within the area must make a Will save or become shaken and also
      take a -2 penalty on saves versus fear effects; the fear and penalty
      persists as long as the creature remains in the area. Devils and any
      lawful evil creatures suffer no negative effects from this spell.</p>
