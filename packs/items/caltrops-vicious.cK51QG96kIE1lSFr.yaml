    value: >-
      <p>These specially modified caltrops have clusters of needle-sharp spines
      that are slightly longer and more brittle than those on normal caltrops.
      Like standard caltrops, a 2-pound bag of vicious caltrops covers a
      5-foot-square area. Vicious caltrops work just like normal caltrops, save
      that they have an attack bonus of +4, do 1d2 points of damage, and require
      a DC 20 Heal check to fully treat.</p>
