  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, a monkâ€™s <em>evasion</em> ability improves. He still
      takes no damage on a successful <em>Reflex</em> <em>saving throw</em>
      against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed
      save. A <em>helpless</em> monk does not gain the benefit of <em>improved
      evasion</em>.</p>
