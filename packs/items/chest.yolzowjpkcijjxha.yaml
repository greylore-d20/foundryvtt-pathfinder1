      <p>A treasure chest begins as a common wooden chest, and is then treated
      with resin to make the wood water-resistant. Metal bands, usually bronze
      to prevent rusting, are strapped around the treasure chest for extra
      reinforcement, and the lock is also made of bronze. A treasure chest uses
      the same statistics as an ordinary wooden chest of its same size, but its
      <em>hit points</em> increase by 25% and its break DC increases by 2.
      Treasure chests stand up better to water travel and to being buried
      compared to ordinary chests.</p>
