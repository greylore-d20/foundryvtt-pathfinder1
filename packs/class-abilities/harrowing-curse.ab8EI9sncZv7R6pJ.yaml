  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can curse a target creature by touching it with a card
      randomly drawn from a harrow deck she owns. The target is affected as if
      by the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.lsboosfk26m0ycqv]{Bestow Curse} using
      the witch’s caster level, except that the witch can decrease only the
      ability score that corresponds to the suit of the card drawn. Whether or
      not the save is successful, a creature cannot be targeted by this hex more
      than once in 24 hours.</p><p>At 15th level, this hex acts as a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.dzctlcf0sy7o2fa3]{major curse} spell.</p><p>A
      witch with the cartomancer archetype can combine this hex with her spell
      deck’s deliver touch spell ability.</p>
