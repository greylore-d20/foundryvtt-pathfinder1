      <p>You conjure protective wisps of darkness made from shadow. If you are
      reduced below 0 hit points or rendered unconscious, <i>shadow
      endurance</i> immediately discharges, shunting your injured body into a
      hidden alcove on the Shadow Plane. You immediately stabilize, but cannot
      awaken or take any further actions until the second duration expires.  As
      you vanish, a quasi-real duplicate of you made from shadow substance
      appears where you fell, as if created by <i>shadow conjuration</i>. The
      duplicate acts on your initiative and is under your control. Your
      duplicate is 1/4 as real as you and appears with 25% of your full hit
      point total, and any creature that fails a Will saving throw believes it
      to be you. The duplicate has the same equipment-based bonuses as you, but
      deals only 1/4 of your normal damage against enemies. It can cast any
      spells you can, drawing on your reserve of magic, but the duplicate's
      caster level is 1/4 your actual level. Regardless of your alignment, your
      shadow duplicate is neutral evil, though it will not harm your friends and
      allies.  When the second duration of the spell expires, your duplicate
      disappears and your body reappears in the location from which you
      vanished. If the image is destroyed, the spell immediately expires and
      your body reappears.</p>
