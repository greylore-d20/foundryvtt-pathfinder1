As a standard action, you can raise or lower the level of water as if using @Compendium[pf1.spells.7yf67b7y4byj96w7]{Control Water}, or move an amount of water equal to 1/1,000th the amount controlled by that spell to a different location in range. The water remains where you placed it for as long as you remain motionless and take a standard action each round to concentrate on this effect. This wild talent causes a slow effect on creatures made of water, just like control water (Will negates).</p>\n<p>When you cease concentrating, the water flows normally unless you accept 1 point of burn to extend the duration and hold the water in its current position for 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess.</p>"
