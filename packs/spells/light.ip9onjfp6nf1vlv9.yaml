  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding
      normal light in a 20-foot radius from the point touched, and increasing
      the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light
      (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an
      area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is
      immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.</p><p>You can only have
      one light spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while
      another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If
      you make this spell permanent (through permanency or a similar effect), it
      does not count against this limit. Light can be used to counter or dispel
      any darkness spell of equal or lower spell level.</p>
