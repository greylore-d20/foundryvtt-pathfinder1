  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You rapidly catalog and collate all available data on a person, place,
    thing, or event, calling to mind scraps of memory and assembling clues in a
    logical and systematic order. Immediately after casting the spell, you can
    begin spending the necessary time to perform an Intelligence check, a
    Linguistics check to detect a forgery or decipher a hidden message, or a
    Knowledge check. If the check requires at least 3 rounds, you can perform it
    five times as quickly (minimum 1 round). If the check required fewer than 3
    rounds, you can perform it instantly. Either way, you gain an insight bonus
    on the check equal to your caster level (maximum bonus +10), but this bonus
    can't raise your result above what you could have achieved on a natural
    20.</p>
