    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to surround yourself in fire as a
      <em>swift action</em>. This fire burns for a number of rounds per day
      equal to your character level plus your <em>Charisma</em> bonus. These
      rounds do not have to be consecutive.</p>

      <p>Any unarmed attacks you make while affected by immolation deal an
      additional 1d6 points of fire damage, and any creature that ends its turn
      adjacent to you while youâ€™re affected by immolation also takes 1d6 points
      of fire damage.</p>
