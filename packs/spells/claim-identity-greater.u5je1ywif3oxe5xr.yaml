      <p>This spell functions as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.6rs8aoks1cqkr6o5]{claim identity}, except it
      transforms its target into a helpless, inanimate porcelain mask for the
      spell's duration. The target remains aware of everything it can see or
      hear while transformed. The target can't speak or move, but can still take
      purely mental actions (such as casting certain spells) or be targeted by
      spells that affect its mind. Any creature donning this mask is transformed
      into a flawless imitation of the spell's target, as if affected by
      <em>claim identity</em>, and reverts to its natural form upon removing the
      mask. Any damage dealt to the mask immediately ends this spell.</p>
