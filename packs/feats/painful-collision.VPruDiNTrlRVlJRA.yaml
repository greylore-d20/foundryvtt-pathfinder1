      damaging collisions.</em></p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Str 13, Improved
      Bull Rush, Power Attack.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you bull rush an enemy
      into another creature, both creatures take 1d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 5
      feet your original target has moved as a result of your bull rush. For
      instance, if you successfully bull rush a goblin 10 feet and it then
      collides with another goblin, both creatures would take 3d6 points of
      bludgeoning damage.</p>
