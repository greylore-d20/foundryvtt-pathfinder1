    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus
      (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect
      that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic
      spells, he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p>
