    value: >-
      <p>The shaman gains DR 2/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for every 4
      levels beyond 8th the shaman possesses. In addition, as a standard action,
      she can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode from her body in a
      10-foot-radius burst. This deals 1d6 points of piercing damage per 2
      shaman levels she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this
      damage.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait
      1d4 rounds between each use.</p>
