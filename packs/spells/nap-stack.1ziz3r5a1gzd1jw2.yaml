      <p>You reduce the amount of uninterrupted sleep or rest creatures within
      the spell's area need in order to recover from injuries, regain spells, or
      other special abilities to 2 hours instead of the normal eight. In
      addition, if creatures continue to sleep or rest beyond the initial 2
      hours, every additional 2 hours counts as a day of rest for the purpose of
      recovering hit points, ability damage, as well as for enduring diseases,
      poisons, or other afflictions. This means 8 total hours of sleep counts as
      4 days for natural healing and for saving throws as diseases or similar
      afflictions run their course. When suffering from diseases, poison, or
      other afflictions, sleepers experience vivid dreams that help them track
      their recovery. If things go poorly they can, at any time, wake themselves
      up in order to seek a better alternative. If awoken or otherwise disturbed
      during this 8-hour period, creatures may return to sleep but they no
      longer enjoy the benefits of the accelerated recovery time. Creatures can
      only enjoy the benefits of this spell once in any 1-week period.</p>
