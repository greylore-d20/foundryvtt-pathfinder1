There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p>\n<p><b><em>Salt Shot Cartridge</em>:</b> (<b>Source</b> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</em>) This mix of black powder and rock salt can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or other scatter weapon. It deals nonlethal instead of lethal damage, and increases the misfire value by 1. You can use it only with a scatter weapon's cone attack.</p>"
