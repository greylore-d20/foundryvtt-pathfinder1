    value: >-
      <p>With a touch, you cause the victim of this spell to suffer a painful
      curse that causes it to grow hideously disfigured. The physical appearance
      of the deformity is subject to the caster's whim (most demon worshipers
      choose deformities that reflect their Abyssal patron's shape or form). The
      target takes one of the following penalties. </p><ul><li> -2 decrease to
      an ability score (minimum 1). </li><li> -2 penalty on attack rolls or
      saving throws. </li><li> Land speed reduced by 5 feet.  You may also
      invent other effects, but they should be no more powerful than those
      described above.</li></ul><p></p>
