    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to disrupt spellcasting with a
      touch. As a melee <em>touch attack</em>, you can place a disruptive field
      around the target. While the field is in place, the target must make a
      <em>concentration</em> check to cast any spell or to use a <em>spell-like
      ability</em> in addition to any other required <em>concentration</em>
      checks. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell’s level. If
      the check is failed, the target’s spell is wasted. This field lasts for a
      number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). You can use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>
