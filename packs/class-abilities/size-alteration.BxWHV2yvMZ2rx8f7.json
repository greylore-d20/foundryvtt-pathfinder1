You can increase or decrease the creature’s size by one step, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.jnlr9cuepka1l26e]{Enlarge Person} or @Compendium[pf1.spells.2y9e1l6zso9tdg0a]{Reduce Person} but not limited by the creature’s type.</p>\n<p>If the creature is hostile toward you, using this ability requires a successful melee touch attack, and the creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect.</p>\n<p>This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>You can’t use this ability on a creature that is already subject to an effect that alters its size.</p>"
