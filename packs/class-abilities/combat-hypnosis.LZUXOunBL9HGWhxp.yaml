  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can lull her enemies into a trance, even in the chaos of
      combat. This hex functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.3ntxp3zun1j9mf0m]{Hypnotism}, except it can affect
      only one creature at a time, and the target creature does not receive the
      usual +2 bonus on its saving throw while in combat. Whether or not the
      save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for
      1 day.</p>
