      <p>A <i>sleep</i> spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of
      creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among
      creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of
      origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature
      are wasted. <i>Sleep</i>ing creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding
      awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a
      creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).
      <i>Sleep</i> does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead
      creatures.</p>
