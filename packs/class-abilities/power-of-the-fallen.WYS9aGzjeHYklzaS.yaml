  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can touch a dying creature and channel its life energy into another
      living creature. This ability acts as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.k0k8gvqyy3rd5gke]{Death Knell}, except you can
      choose any ally (including yourself ) within 30 feet to gain the benefit
      of this effect, and you can apply the +2 enhancement bonus to either
      Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. You can use this ability a number of
      times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 5th level to select this revelation.</p>
