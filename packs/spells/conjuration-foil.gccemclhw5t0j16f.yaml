      <p>All creatures in the area gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against
      teleportation effects. If any creature would enter or depart the area via
      a summoning or teleportation effect, that creature takes 1d6 points of
      damage per spell level of the triggering effect (or half the HD of the
      originating creature if the effect has no spell level) and arrives in a
      random similar location within the triggering effect's range, rather than
      the intended destination. A successful Will save halves the damage and
      negates the altered destination.</p>
