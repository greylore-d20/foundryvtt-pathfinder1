    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes ammunition already loaded into the target firearm is
      ruined with moisture. Any attempt to fire that ammunition fails, with no
      chance for misfire, and the user must then take a full-round action to
      clear the weapon before reloading and firing it. If aware of this spell's
      effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to
      identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can
      spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm.
      Doing so destroys that ammunition.</p>
