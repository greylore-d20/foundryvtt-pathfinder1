  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can perform a 1-minute ritual that infuses a flask of water with
      one of your prepared spells, creating an improvised potion that lasts
      until consumed or the next time you prepare spells. You can use this
      ability only with spells that target one or more creatures, and the
      maximum spell level you can infuse in this way is equal to 1 + 1 for every
      4 cleric levels you have. These potions are treated as alchemist extracts
      for the purpose of your domain spells. You can use this ability a number
      of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Artificer's Touch power from the Artifice
      Domain or the Hand of the Acolyte power from the Magic Domain.</p>
