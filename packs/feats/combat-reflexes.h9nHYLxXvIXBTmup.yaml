    value: >-
      <p><em>You can make additional attacks of
      opportunity.</em><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You may make a number of
      additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to your Dexterity bonus.
      With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while
      flat-footed.<p><strong>Normal</strong>: A character without this feat can
      make only one attack of opportunity per round and can't make attacks of
      opportunity while flat-footed.<p><strong>Special</strong>: The Combat
      Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability more
      than once per round.<h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>When you miss with an attack
      of opportunity, you can spend 5 stamina points to make a second attack for
      the same provoking action. That second attack of opportunity takes a -5
      penalty on the attack roll and costs one of your attacks of opportunity
      for the round.</p><p><b>Usage</b>: spend 1 charge after use.</p>
