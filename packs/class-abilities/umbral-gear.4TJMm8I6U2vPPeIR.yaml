    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action while in an area of dim light or darkness, a
      character with this talent can coalesce wisps of shadow into a quasi-real,
      functional item. The character must choose whether to make a crowbar, 50
      feet of silk rope, a glass cutter, a light melee weapon with which she is
      proficient, a reversible cloak, thieves’ tools, or a wire saw; the GM may
      allow other similar items. The character can use such items for a number
      of minutes per day equal to 10 plus her character’s class level. This
      duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute
      increments.</p><p>An item created with this ability remains until the
      character is no longer touching it, or until the character runs out of
      duration for this talent, at which time it dissolves. A character can
      select this talent more than once, gaining an additional 10 minutes of
      duration each time this talent is selected. If a character has selected
      this talent at least twice, she adds 50 feet of silk rope with a grappling
      hook, a masterwork light melee weapon with which she is proficient, and
      masterwork thieves’ tools to the list of things she can create.</p>
