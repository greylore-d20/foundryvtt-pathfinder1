Once per round, before he makes an attack of opportunity, he can declare it to be a vital punishment. If the attack hits, the vigilante can apply the Vital Strike feat. The vigilante can apply the @Compendium[pf1.feats.DorPGQ2mifJbMKH8]{Improved Vital Strike} or @Compendium[pf1.feats.zKNk7a4XxXsygJ67]{Greater Vital Strike} feat as his vital punishment instead if he later gains those feats.</p>\n<p>A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent</p>"
