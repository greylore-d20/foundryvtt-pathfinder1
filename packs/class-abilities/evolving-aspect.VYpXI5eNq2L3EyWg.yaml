      <p>At 8th level, you gain
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.dPLj98GIzbwcoOjn]{Aspect of the Beast} as
      a bonus feat even if you donâ€™t meet the prerequisites. As normal for the
      feat, you must choose one of the manifestations, and you gain its benefits
      even while not bloodraging. When you enter a bloodrage, you can choose a
      second manifestation to affect you simultaneously for the duration of your
      bloodrage.</p>
