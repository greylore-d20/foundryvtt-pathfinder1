  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You call upon the frigid depths of outer space to bring a terrible
      chill to your enemies. As a standard action, one target within 30 feet is
      cloaked in the void and takes 1d6 points of cold damage for every oracle
      level you possess. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, the interstellar void is so extreme that a creature that
      fails its save is fatigued.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, a creature that fail its save is exhausted and stunned
      for 1 round.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day
      at 10th level.</p>
