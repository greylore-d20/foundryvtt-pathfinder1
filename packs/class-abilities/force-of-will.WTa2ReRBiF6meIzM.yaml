  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can send thoughts and instructions telepathically to any creature
      within 60 feet that you have charmed or dominated as though you shared a
      common language. At 11th level, affected creatures can communicate back to
      you via the telepathic link as well. At 20th level, any creature that
      succeeds at a <em>saving throw</em> against an <em>enchantment</em> spell
      you have just cast is still affected for 1 round if the spell has a
      duration greater than 1 round.</p>
