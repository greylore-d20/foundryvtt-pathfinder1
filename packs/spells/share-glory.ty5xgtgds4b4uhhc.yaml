      <p>You imbue the targets with a fraction of your mythic nature. They count
      as mythic creatures for the purpose of path abilities, spells, and other
      effects that function differently for mythic creatures. This doesn't grant
      the targets mythic tiers or any uses of mythic power; it merely gives them
      a greater advantage when others use abilities that work differently for
      mythic creatures. You must be at least a 1st-tier mythic character to cast
      this spell.</p>
