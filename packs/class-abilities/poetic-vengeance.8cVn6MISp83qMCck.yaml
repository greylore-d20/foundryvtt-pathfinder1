    value: >-
      <p>You constantly plot and scheme to take your revenge against those who
      wrong you. Once per day as an immediate action, after an enemy
      successfully affects you with an attack (whether with a spell, a physical
      attack, or any other sort of attack), you can force the enemy to take half
      the effects of its own attack unless it succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 +
      1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier). Any damage from the
      attack is halved, and non-damaging effects have a 50% chance to apply. If
      the non-damaging effect has a DC, the enemy receives a saving throw
      against it, at either the DC of the original effect or the DC of this
      ability, whichever is lower.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, you can use this ability twice per day, and at 20th
      level you can use it three times per day.</p>
