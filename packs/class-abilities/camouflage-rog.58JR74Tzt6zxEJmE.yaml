  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, a rogue with this talent can craft simple but effective
      camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The rogue needs 1 minute to
      prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is good for the rest of the
      day or until the rogue fails a saving throw against an area effect spell
      that deals fire, cold, or acid damage, whichever comes first. The rogue
      gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks while within terrain that matches the
      foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability cannot be used in areas
      without natural foliage.</p>
