    value: >-
      <p>You touch the target and place it into a deathlike state that persists
      for the duration. The target appears to be dead, and any creature that
      interacts with the target must succeed at a DC 20 Heal check to recognize
      it is actually alive.  Until the spell ends, the target counts as if it
      were dead for the purpose of resolving any effects that target or affect
      only living creatures, but it doesn't count as undead. The subject is
      helpless, and can still be killed normally.  Any effect that would bring
      the creature back to life or animate it as an undead fails, but ends the
      <i>catatonia</i>. The target can be affected by spells that affect only
      objects, including <i>animate objects</i> (if the creature is Small) and
      <i>teleport object</i>. However, anything that would cause the body to
      change form (such as <i>shrink</i> item) fails and ends the
      <i>catatonia</i>. This doesn't prevent the effects of spells that simply
      deal damage or otherwise destroy objects.</p>
