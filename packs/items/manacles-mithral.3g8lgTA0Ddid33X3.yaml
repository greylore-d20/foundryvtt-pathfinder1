      <p>These bindings are more difficult to break than standard
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.zompehbhvegvncwu]{manacles} and are
      particularly useful against lycanthropes. They have hardness 15, 30 hit
      points, and a break DC of 30. They are otherwise treated as masterwork
      manacles</p><h3>Expanded Information</h3><p><strong>Fetters</strong>:
      These manacles are specifically designed to fit around the ankles, and use
      the same rules for breaking, escape, and cost relative to size. A creature
      in fetters is entangled and can move at only half speed. In addition, a
      fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15 <em>Acrobatics</em> check to
      move more than its (reduced) speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5
      or more, the creature falls prone.</p><p><strong>Frontal
      Restraint</strong>: A creature whose wrists are bound with manacles can
      wield only one melee weapon or shield in combat (the weapon may be a
      two-handed weapon). It cannot make use of ranged weapons, except for
      crossbows (but even these cannot be reloaded by the bound creature). Any
      attack the creature makes while manacled takes a -4 penalty. The creature
      can attempt skill checks using its hands, but at a -5 penalty (-15 on
      Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is
      wearing).</p><p><strong>Rear Restraint</strong>: Manacles might be
      employed to keep a creature's hands behind its back. In such cases, the
      creature cannot use its hands to effectively employ any weapon or shield.
      The creature can attempt to use its hands to perform a skill, but at a -10
      penalty (-25 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the
      creature is wearing). While manacled, a creature can attempt to flip its
      arms beneath its legs, bringing its hands in front of itself. This
      requires a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a separate Escape Artist
      check is then required to escape the manacles).</p><p><strong>Restraining
      Two Individuals</strong>: Two creatures might share one set of manacles.
      While manacled together, the manacled individuals must remain adjacent to
      one another. If they are not working together, they are both treated as
      grappled. If they are working together, they can move together in the same
      round (using the movement speed of the slower creature). A manacled
      creature can forfeit its turn during combat to mimic the other manacled
      creature's movements, allowing that creature to act as if
      unrestrained.</p>
