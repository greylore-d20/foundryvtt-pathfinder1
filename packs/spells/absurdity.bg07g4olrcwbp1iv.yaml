      <p>Your targets perceive intimidation and threats as laughably absurd. A
      character attempting to intimidate your targets is instead perceived as
      having exaggerated facial features or babbling and awkward speech. Effects
      that impose fear conditions become objects of ridicule, with the targets
      making fun of the source of the object as it attempts to scare them.
      <i>Absurdity</i> protects your targets from gaining lesser fear conditions
      (spooked, shaken, and scared), granting them immunity to spooked and a 50%
      chance to negate shaken or scared conditions instead of gaining them from
      any effect, including uses of the Intimidate skill to demoralize. Any
      other effect related to a spell or ability that generates fear (such as
      dying from a <i>phantasmal killer</i>) affects them normally, and effects
      that ignore immunity to fear also ignore <i>absurdity</i>.  However,
      target creatures also have serious difficulty noticing potential threats;
      they take a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to avoid surprise or to
      notice that a creature is actively threatening or malicious and a -2
      penalty on initiative checks. The spell doesn't prevent spells or effects
      that provide early warning or a form of danger sense (like <i>anticipate
      peril</i> or <i>find traps</i>) from alerting the affected character to
      danger.</p>
