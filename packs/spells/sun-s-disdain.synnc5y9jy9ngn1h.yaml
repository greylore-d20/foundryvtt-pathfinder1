    value: >-
      <p>You alter a creature so the touch of the sun is hostile to it. The
      cursed creature gains <i>light</i> blindness and is blinded for 1 round if
      exposed to bright <i>light</i>, such as sun<i>light</i> or the
      <i>daylight</i> spell. The cursed creature is dazzled as long as it
      remains in areas of bright <i>light</i>, and it is treated as being
      particularly susceptible to sun<i>light</i> for the purposes of resolving
      spells like searing <i>light</i>, <i>sunbeam</i>, and <i>sunburst</i>.</p>
