      <p>You can determine whether or not two or more creatures are related by
      blood. The amount of information gleaned depends on how long you study a
      particular area or set of subjects. <i>1st round</i>: Whether or not the
      subjects are related by blood. <i>2nd round</i>: Number of related
      subjects and their general relation to one another (for example, this
      would reveal that one subject is a descendant of the other, but it would
      not specify "mother" or "grandmother"). <i>3rd round</i>: Precise
      relationship between subjects in the area. A target's Will save prevents
      you from determining its exact relationship with another creature, and
      only one subject needs to succeed at this save to prevent you from
      determining its relationship with another creature. (So, for instance, if
      two brothers are in the area and one succeeds at his Will save, you could
      tell that they are siblings, but could not distinguish whether they are
      full- or half-siblings.)  Each round, you can turn to detect relations in
      a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 6 inches of stone, 1
      inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 1 foot of wood or dirt will
      block it.  This spell functions by analyzing the blood and minds of
      creatures in the area, collectively examining these traits and comparing
      them to those of others in the area while looking for patterns. Thus,
      adoptive siblings and parents cannot be detected with this spell, since
      they share no blood.</p>
