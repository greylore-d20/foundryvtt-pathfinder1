      <p>This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst
      in front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled for 1 minute
      unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. Sightless creatures, as well
      as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by flare.</p>
