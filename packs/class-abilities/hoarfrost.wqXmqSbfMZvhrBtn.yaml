    value: >-
      <p>The target is rimed with a shell of frost needles that slowly work
      their way into its flesh (Fortitude negates). The target turns pale and
      blue, and takes 1 point of Constitution damage per minute until it dies,
      saves (once per minute), or is cured. Break enchantment, dispel magic,
      remove curse, and similar spells end the effect.</p>

      <p>If the target saves, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold
      effect.</p>
