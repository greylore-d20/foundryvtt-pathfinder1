      S</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Pirates who lose a hand in the course of their
      adventures sometimes attach hooks to their wrists. Hook hands can't be
      disarmed. They generally don't interfere with day-to-day activities, but
      can't be used for tasks that would require an actual hand (such as
      completing somatic components, drawing arrows, or holding a weapon with
      both hands).</p>
