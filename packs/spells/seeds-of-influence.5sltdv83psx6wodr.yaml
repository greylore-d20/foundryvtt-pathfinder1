    value: >-
      <p>You leave a magical trace in the mind of a creature with an attitude of
      at least indifferent toward you. The target takes a cumulative -2 penalty
      on its Will save to negate the spell for each step by which its attitude
      is better than indifferent.  The target takes a -2 penalty on saving
      throws against divination spells you cast. You can target that creature
      with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than <i>Seeds of
      Influence</i> as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the
      modified spell doesn't take longer to cast and doesn't use a higher-level
      spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a
      divination or mind-affecting spell you cast, <i>Seeds of Influence</i>
      ends for that target. A creature can  be subject to only one <i>Seeds of
      Influence</i> spell at a time; later castings of <i>Seeds of Influence</i>
      remove any previous casting.</p>
