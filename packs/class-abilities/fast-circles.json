He can draw a magic circle as a full-round action, but any circle drawn in this way has a duration of 1 minute per occultist level (unless itâ€™s drawn in conjunction with the outside contact class feature, in which case it lasts for 10 minutes as normal). If he draws a binding circle in this way, its duration is 1 round per occultist level.</p>"
