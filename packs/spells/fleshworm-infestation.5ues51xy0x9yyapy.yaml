    value: >-
      <p>With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest in
      the target's flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save every round.
      Failure means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity
      damage, and is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no
      hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than
      staggered. <i>Fleshworm infestation</i> cannot be ended early by <i>remove
      disease</i> or <i>heal</i>, as the infestation starts anew if the current
      worms are slain. <i>Protection from Evil</i> negates this spell's effects
      for as long as the two durations overlap.</p><p><i>Dispel evil</i>
      automatically ends a <i>fleshworm infestation</i>.</p>
