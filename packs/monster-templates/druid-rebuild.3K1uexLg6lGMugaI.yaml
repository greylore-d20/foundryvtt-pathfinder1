      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      Yes<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Drawn to the raw might and power of
      nature, a druid creature gains the ability to change shape and cast druid
      spells. A druid creature's CR increases by 2 if the creature has 7 or more
      HD, and it increases by 3 if the creature has 13 or more HD.<p><b>Quick
      Rules:</b> +2 on all rolls based on Wis; can use wild shape† if it has 7
      or more HD (using its HD – 3 as its druid level to determine the effect of
      the wild shape); can cast a small number of druid spells (see the Cleric,
      Druid, and Wizard Spell Slots table above) using its HD as its CL;
      woodland stride†.<p><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> Special Attacks wild shape† (if
      it has 7 or more HD, using its HD – 3 as its druid level to determine the
      effect of the wild shape); Druid Spells can cast a small number of druid
      spells (see the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard Spell Slots table above) using
      its HD as its CL; Ability Scores +4 Wisdom; SQ woodland
      stride†.<p><b>Animal Companion:</b> These rules assume the druid creature
      doesn't have an animal companion. If you want to add one, select a
      creature from the list of a summon nature's ally spell. The spell must
      have a level no higher than 1/2 the creature's CR. Treat the companion as
      an additional creature in the encounter, awarding XP for defeating it as
      if it was not an animal companion.</p>
