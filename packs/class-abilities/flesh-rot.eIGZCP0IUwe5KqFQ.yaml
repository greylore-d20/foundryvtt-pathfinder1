  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack and expend 1
      point of mental focus to cause the flesh of a living creature to rot and
      wither. If the attack hits, the target takes 1d8 points of damage + 1
      point per occultist level you possess.</p>

      <p>For every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 3rd, the target takes
      an additional 1d8 points of damage (to a maximum of 5d8 at 19th level). If
      you miss with the melee touch attack, this power is wasted with no
      effect.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>
