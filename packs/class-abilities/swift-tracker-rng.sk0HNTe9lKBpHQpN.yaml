  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while
      using <em>Survival</em> to follow tracks without taking the normal –5
      penalty. He takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when
      moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
