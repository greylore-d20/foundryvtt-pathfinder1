    "shortDescription": "<p>A <i>grease</i> spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery <i>grease</i>. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of <i>grease</i> at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.</p><p>The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.</p><p>Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the <i>grease</i>d item. A creature wearing <i>grease</i>d armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.</p>"
