  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area,
    causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things
    for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust,
    which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each round
    at the end of their turn blinded creatures may attempt new saving throws to
    end the blindness effect.</p><p>Any creature covered by the dust takes a -40
    penalty on Stealth checks.</p>
