This functions as if you possessed your familiar using <i>magic jar</i>; your familiar simultaneously possesses your body in the same manner. You can't freely transfer your soul between your body and your familiar's-if you choose to return to your body as a standard action, the spell ends. If either body is killed, both spirits return to their original bodies, the spell ends, and the original owner of the slain body dies.</p>"
