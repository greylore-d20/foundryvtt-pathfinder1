  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a
      move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A hand crossbow fires
      standard crossbow bolts, like those used by light and heavy
      crossbows.</p><p>You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one
      hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you
      take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.</p>
