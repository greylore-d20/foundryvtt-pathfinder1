  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You conjure up an extradimensional meadow that can be accessed from a
    single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point
    looks like a circle of toadstools enclosing a 10-foot square. Only those you
    designate can enter the meadow before you do, and the portal is shut and
    made invisible behind you when you enter. You can open it again from your
    own side at will. Once a visitor has passed through the entry point, they
    find themselves in an idyllic twilight meadow surrounded by an impassable
    grove of fruit and nut trees. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and
    warm.</p><p>You can configure the meadow into any shape you desire, to the
    limit of the spell's effect. The place is comfortable and temperate. The
    trees can provide enough food to sustain 4 people per caster level for a
    day. A staff of near-transparent animal or feylike servants (as many as two
    per caster level) wait upon all who enter. The servants function as
    <i>unseen servant</i> spells except that they are visible and can go
    anywhere in the meadow.</p><p>Since the place can be entered only through
    its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the meadow, nor do
    conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.</p>
