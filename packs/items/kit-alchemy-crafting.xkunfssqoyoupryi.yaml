      <p>An @Compendium[pf1.classes.JcaqlAawhf14q1lq]{Alchemist} with an alchemy
      crafting kit is assumed to have all the material <em>components</em>
      needed for his extracts, mutagens, and bombs, except for those
      <em>components</em> that have a specific cost. An alchemy crafting kit
      provides no bonuses on
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.3E8pxbjI8MD3JbfQ]{Craft
      (alchemy)} checks. (This item was previously called an "alchemist's kit",
      and was renamed to avoid confusion with the set of adventuring gear called
      an "alchemist's kit.")</p>
