      "value": "<p>At 14th level, the summoner's life becomes linked to his eidolon's. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to 0 hit points is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but don't deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.t8ei2mrmqg7252vw]{baleful polymorph}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.361rc74674l3zt9a]{flesh to stone}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.esia6azb5g68tfs7]{imprisonment}, or other spells that don't deal damage.</p>"
