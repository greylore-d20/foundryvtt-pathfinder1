Her understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of reality has also become so advanced that she can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.nnj51dwfkwd15ngj]{Wish} once per day. This doesn’t require a material component, but the wish cannot be used to grant ability score bonuses or replicate spells with expensive material components.</p>"
