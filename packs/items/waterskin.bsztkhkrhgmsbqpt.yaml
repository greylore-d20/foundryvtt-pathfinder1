      <p>A water or wineskin holds 1/2 gallon of liquid and weighs 4 lb when

      one-quarter the normal amount when made for Small characters. Weighs twice
      the normal amount when made for Large characters. Containers carry

      <h3>Magic Containers</h3>

      <p>Magic containers come in almost as many varieties as there are
      <em>alchemists</em>, and so are of inestimable value to
      <em>alchemists</em> with specific needs. Some of the most well-known magic
      containers are described here.</p>

      <p>Because of a varied nature of alchemical items and their effects, not
      all combinations of alchemical items and magic bottles are viable or even
      make sense, even though they technically might be allowed by the rules.
      The GM should have the final say on whether or not a particular alchemical
      item can function within one of the magical containers listed in this
      section.</p>
