  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>bestow curse</i>, except that you must state a
    condition under which the curse is broken, ending its effect. An intelligent
    target, even one of animal intelligence, innately understands this condition
    even if it doesn't understand your language. The condition must be possible
    for the target to bring about within a year and a day without ensuring its
    own death and stated in 25 or fewer words. The curse is more difficult to
    remove via magic. The DC to remove <i>conditional curse</i> with <i>break
    enchantment</i> or <i>remove curse</i> increases by 5.</p>
