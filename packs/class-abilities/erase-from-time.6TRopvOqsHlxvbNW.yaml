    value: >-
      <p>As a melee touch attack, you can temporarily remove a creature from
      time altogether. The target creature must make a Fortitude save or vanish
      completely for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum
      1 round). No magic or divinations can detect the creature during this
      time, as it exists outside of time and spaceâ€”in effect, the creature
      ceases to exist for the duration of this ability. At the end of the
      duration, the creature reappears unharmed in the space it last occupied
      (or the nearest possible space, if the original space is now
      occupied).</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
      at 11th level.</p>
