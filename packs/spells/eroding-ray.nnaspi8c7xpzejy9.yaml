  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You channel a fraction of the tumultuous ecosystem of the Hao Jin
      Tapestry and redirect it through your hands as a beam of deteriorating
      energy. You can fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every 4 levels
      beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a
      ranged touch attack to hit and can target only a construct or an object.
      If a ray hits, the target begins to crumble, taking 2d6 points of damage.
      This damage ignores hardness and damage reduction.</p>
