A typical <em>holy text</em> for an experienced adventuring priest is durable, with a leather cover, chapter illustrations, quality paper; it costs 25 gp and weighs 2 pounds. The most expensive versions have detailed illustrations, gilded initials and border decorations, covers made of fine leather, wood, or even metal, and are often oversized and difficult to carry around. <b>Price</b> 1-100 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1-20 lbs.</p>"
