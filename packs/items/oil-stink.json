You can throw a vial of stink oil as a <em>splash weapon</em> with a range increment of 10 feet. If a creature with the <em>scent</em> ability is standing in the square of impact, it must succeed at a DC 14 <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>nauseated</em> for 1d4+1 rounds. Any creature with <em>scent</em> in an adjacent square must succeed at a DC 12 <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>sickened</em> for 1 round. Creatures without the <em>scent</em> ability are not affected by stink oil.</p>"
