    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, your ultimate destiny is drawing near. Once per day,
      when an attack or spell that causes damage would result in your death, you
      may attempt a DC 20 <em>Will save</em>. If successful, you are instead
      reduced to â€“1 hit points and are automatically stabilized. The bonus from
      your fated ability applies to this save.</p>
