A cheating gambler's kit is very similar, except its cards are marked and its games are rigged, giving a knowledgeable user a +4 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Profession</em> (gambler) checks when using these materials. A DC 25 <em>Perception</em> or DC 20 <em>Profession</em> (gambler) check exposes the ruse.</p>"
