  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create an arrow made of crackling electricity, which you may use
      for one of two effects.</p><p><i>Attack</i>: You may throw the arrow up to
      Medium range or fire it from a bow up to the bow's maximum range. Either
      use is a ranged touch attack. The arrow deals 1d6 points of electricity
      damage + 1 point per level (maximum +5).</p><p><i>Beacon</i>: You throw or
      fire the arrow straight up. When it reaches maximum range or a solid
      surface (such as the roof of a cave) it explodes in a peal of thunder and
      forms a forked bolt of electricity resembling Erastil's holy symbol, which
      lingers for 1 round. The thunder and lightning are as loud and bright as
      natural thunder and lightning, but they do not harm any nearby
      creatures.</p>
