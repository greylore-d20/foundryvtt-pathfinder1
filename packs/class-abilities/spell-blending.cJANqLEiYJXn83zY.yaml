  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a magus selects this arcana, he must select one spell from the
      wizard spell list that is of a magus spell level he can cast. He adds this
      spell to his spellbook and list of magus spells known as a magus spell of
      its wizard spell level. He can instead select two spells to add in this
      way, but both must be at least one level lower than the highest-level
      magus spell he can cast.</p>

      <p>A magus can select this magus arcana more than once.</p>
