    value: >-
      <p>Those who seek to slay with a single shot must have keen eyes and
      perfect poise. As an attack action, the slayer makes a single ranged
      attack at his highest attack bonus with a ranged weapon he wields. The
      target of the attack must be the slayerâ€™s studied target. On a successful
      hit, the slayer doubles the number of sneak attack dice applied to the
      attack; if the attack was not a sneak attack, this benefit does not
      apply.</p>
