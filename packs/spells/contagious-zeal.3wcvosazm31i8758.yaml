      <p>The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage
      rolls, 1d6 temporary hit points, and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws
      against fear effects and to the DC of  Intimidate checks attempted against
      her. Once per round, the target can select one other creature to gain this
      bonus as well. The chosen creature can be no farther from the target than
      25 feet + 5 feet for every 2 caster levels you possess, and a creature
      can't be selected more than once in this way. Such allies gain only the
      bonuses and temporary hit points; they don't continue to spread it to
      other creatures. The additional creatures' bonuses and temporary hit
      points share the original spell's duration, so when that duration ends,
      all affected creatures lose their bonuses and any remaining temporary hit
      points from this spell.</p>
