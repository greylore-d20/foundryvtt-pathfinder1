Until the next time your burn is removed, you can begin or end the cold aura at will as a swift action. The temperature in the area 30 feet around you lowers by 5° F per kineticist level you possess, to a minimum modified temperature of –10° F. If this brings the temperature in the area below 40° F, all creatures within 5 feet of you take a –4 penalty to Dexterity. You are immune to these effects, as are creatures that are immune to cold or that benefit from effects that protect against temperature, such as&nbsp;endure elements.</p>"
