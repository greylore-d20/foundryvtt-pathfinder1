    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his
      studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against
      a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following
      effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6
      rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must
      succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The
      DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer’s level + the slayer’s
      Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be
      targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p>
