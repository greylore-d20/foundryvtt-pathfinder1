      "value": "<p>The alchemist can mask murder behind beneficence. When preparing an extract with the infusion discovery, he can lace the extract with one of his bombs as long as the extract has a duration greater than instantaneous. If he chooses, the alchemist can reduce the duration of the extract to 1 round. As soon as the extract’s duration expires, it detonates, dealing 150% of the alchemist’s bomb damage to the drinker. This effect does not produce a splash radius. Producing a tainted extract consumes both an infusion slot and a daily bomb use.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must know both the delayed bomb and infusion discoveries to select this discovery.</p>"
