  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you can turn your fists into metal for 1 round,
      allowing you to make unarmed strikes that deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage plus your Strength modifier. These unarmed strikes do not provoke
      attacks of opportunity, but attacking with both uses the two-weapon
      fighting rules as normal. In addition, these unarmed strikes ignore the
      hardness of items with a hardness of 10 or less. You can use this ability
      a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Acid Dart power of the Earth Domain.</p>
