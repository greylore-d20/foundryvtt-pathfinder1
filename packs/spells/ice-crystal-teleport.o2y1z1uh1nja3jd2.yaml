    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>teleport</i>, except you use it to
      <i>teleport</i> yourself or one other creature to a safe location you
      specify (the target can bring along objects as long as their weight
      doesn't exceed the target's heavy load). You can only send the target to a
      location with which you are very familiar. The target is first trapped in
      ice (hardness 0, 3 hit points per inch of thickness, 1 inch thick per
      caster level) for 1d4 rounds, during which time it is paralyzed, aware but
      unable to take any physical actions, and begins to fade away as the
      <i>teleport</i>ation aspect takes effect. At the end of the 1d4 rounds,
      the target <i>teleport</i>s to the specified location, and the ice's hit
      points drop to 0 and it quickly melts away. If the ice is destroyed before
      the target <i>teleport</i>s, the spell ends and the <i>teleport</i>
      doesn't occur.</p>
