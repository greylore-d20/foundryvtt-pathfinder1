  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You make your target look like a younger version of itself. You select
      how much younger it looks (for example, "10 years" or "as a young adult").
      You cannot otherwise change details of the target's appearance other than
      those directly associated with aging (for example, gray hair returns to
      its original color). The target cannot appear so much younger that it
      changes size.</p><p>This spell does not affect any age-based modifications
      to ability scores or other age-related effects.</p>
