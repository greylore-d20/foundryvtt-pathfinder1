    value: >-
      <p>You invoke the mystical power of the moon to drive the target into a
      mad, bestial frenzy. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1
      round, dropping held items as its nails and teeth elongate and sharpen.
      The target gains a bite attack and two claw attacks that deal damage
      appropriate for the creature's size, and for the remainder of the spell's
      duration the target behaves as if under simultaneous <i>rage</i> and
      <i>confusion</i> spells, attacking with its natural weapons in preference
      to other actions. During the final round of the spell's duration, the
      target is again dazed as it returns to its normal state.</p>
