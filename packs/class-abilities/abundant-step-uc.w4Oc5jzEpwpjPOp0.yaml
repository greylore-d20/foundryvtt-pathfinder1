    value: >-
      <p>A monk with this ki power can slip magically between spaces, as if
      using the spell dimension door. Using this ability is a move action that
      consumes 2 points from his ki pool. The monk's caster level for this
      effect is equal to his monk level. He cannot take other creatures with him
      when he uses this ability.</p>

      <p>A monk must be at least 8th level before selecting this ki power.</p>
