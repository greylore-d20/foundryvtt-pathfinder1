      <p>This spell provides the subject with some degree of protection from the
      harmful effects of the sun. The cloaked subject treats environmental heat
      due to sun exposure as one level less: severe heat is considered very hot
      conditions, while very hot is considered average temperature (see page 444
      of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> for heat dangers). The <i>cloak of shade</i>
      also reduces any penalties from sunlight by 1. The spell does not,
      however, eliminate the effects of direct sunlight on creatures vulnerable
      to sunlight. <i>Cloak of shade</i> has no effect on environmental heat
      from sources other than the sun.</p>
