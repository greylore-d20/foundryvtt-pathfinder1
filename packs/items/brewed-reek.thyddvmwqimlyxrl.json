When boiled, this mixture becomes a thick alchemical slime that adheres to anything it touches. You can hurl brewed reek as a <em>splash weapon</em> with a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck with a direct hit must succeed at a DC 15 <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>sickened</em> for 2d6 rounds. If the target fails its save, it must make a second <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>nauseated</em> for 1 round. Creatures in the splash area must make a <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>sickened</em> for 1 round. A creature that drinks brewed reek does not get a saving throw and is <em>sickened</em> for 2d6 rounds and <em>nauseated</em> for 1 round.</p>\n<p><b>Create</b>: <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC 25</p>"
