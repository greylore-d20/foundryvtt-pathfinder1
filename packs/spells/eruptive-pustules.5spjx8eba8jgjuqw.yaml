  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your skin erupts in swollen, pus-filled bumps that burst open if you
      are struck. Any creature that strikes you with its body or a hand-held
      weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6
      points of acid damage and must save or be sickened for 1 round. If the
      attack against you is a critical hit, the attacker must save or be
      nauseated instead of sickened. This damage can harm a swarm.</p>
