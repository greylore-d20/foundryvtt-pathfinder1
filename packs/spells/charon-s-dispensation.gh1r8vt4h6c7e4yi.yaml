  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target of this spell gains immunity to the harmful effects of
    touching or drinking from the River Styx and a +4 profane bonus on saves
    against effects that alter or suppress memory (such as <i>modify memory</i>
    or mindwipeOA). This does not grant the target the ability to breathe water,
    nor does it grant any protection against creatures or mundane hazards such
    as rapids. The spell has no power to restore memory to a creature already
    suffering from an existing fugue or amnesia state.</p>
