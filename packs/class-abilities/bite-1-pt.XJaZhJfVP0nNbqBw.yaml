  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon's maw is full of razor-sharp teeth, giving it a bite attack.
      This attack is a primary attack. The bite deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8
      if Large, 2d6 if Huge). If the eidolon already has a bite attack, this
      evolution allows it to deal 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage
      rolls made with its bite.</p>
