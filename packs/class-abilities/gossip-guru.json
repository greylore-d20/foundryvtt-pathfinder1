You can use the @Compendium[pf1.spells.piwj11ynlsji0i7a]{Rumormonger} spell once per day as a spell-like ability, using your oracle level as your caster level. Each time you do so, it ends the duration of any previous activation.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, you can use this ability three times per day, and at 15th level, you can use it at will, but regardless, each use still ends the duration of any previous activation.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
