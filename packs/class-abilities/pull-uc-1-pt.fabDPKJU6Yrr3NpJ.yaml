  description:
    value: >-
      <p><b>Requirements:</b> Reach of 10 feet or more.</p>

      <p>The eidolon gains the ability to pull creatures closer with a
      successful attack. Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the eidolon
      makes a successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free
      combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, it pulls the
      target of the attack 5 feet closer to it. This ability works only on
      creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon.
      Creatures pulled in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not
      stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a
      different natural attack.</p>
