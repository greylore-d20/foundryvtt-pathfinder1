While wearing a handle <em>harness</em>, you automatically succeed at checks to aid an adjacent ally of your size or smaller with <em>Climb</em> or <em>Ride</em> checks, or <em>Acrobatics</em> checks to balance on narrow surfaces or uneven ground. A handle <em>harness's</em> ungainly construction gives you a -2 penalty on <em>Escape Artist</em> checks.</p>"
