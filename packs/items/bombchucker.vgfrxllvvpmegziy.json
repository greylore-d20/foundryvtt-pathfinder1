The basket extends approximately 2 feet in a steady curve, allowing you to launch a thrown splash weapon at incredible speeds and over long distances. Using a bombchucker increases the range increment of any thrown splash weapon by 10 feet. Loading a bombchucker requires a free hand, as the hand wielding the bombchucker can't be used for any other purpose. A bombchucker doesn't get in the way of preparing and throwing a bomb created with the bomb class feature.</p>"
