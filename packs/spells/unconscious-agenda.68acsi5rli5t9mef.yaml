      <p>This spell plants a subconscious directive in the target's mind that
      forces him to act as you dictate when specific circumstances arise. The
      target humanoid can be either conscious or unconscious, but must
      understand your language. Upon casting this spell, you must state a course
      of action you <em>wish</em> the target to take. This course of action must
      be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under
      which you <em>wish</em> the target to take this action, also describing it
      in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words
      cause the spell to fail. <em>Unconscious agenda</em> cannot compel a
      target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly
      dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course
      of activity.</p><p>You cannot issue new commands to the target after the
      spell is cast. If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not
      compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are
      encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell
      affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might
      come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can
      function as he <em>wish</em>es until the events you detailed as the
      condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the
      target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the
      spell <em>dominate person</em>. (If the compelled action is against the
      victim's nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus
      against the spell to end its effects.) For the next hour, the target acts
      as you dictated, doing all he can to fulfill your command. If, at the end
      of the hour, the target still has not completed your command, the target
      is released from the enchantment and the spell ends. Once the course of
      action is completed, the spell ends. The target has full memory of acts
      performed during this hour.</p><p>It's difficult to detect an
      <em>unconscious agenda</em> before the spell is triggered. Casting
      <em>detect magic</em> on one affected by it only reveals an aura of
      enchantment if the caster of <em>detect magic</em> has a higher caster
      level then the caster of <em>unconscious agenda</em>. Even if the spell is
      detected, it can only be removed by <em>break enchantment</em>,
      <em>limited wish</em>, <em>remove curse</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or
      <em>wish</em>. <em>Dispel magic</em> does not affect <em>unconscious
      agenda</em>.</p>
