  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When using the Acrobatics skill to jump, a rogue with this talent is
      always considered to have a running start and adds her rogue level to the
      check result. Whenever she deliberately falls, a successful DC 15
      Acrobatics check allows her to ignore the first 20 feet fallen. For every
      5 by which she exceeds the DC of this check, she can ignore an additional
      10 feet of distance fallen.</p>
