  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to make more accurate charge attacks
      while mounted. The cavalier receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a
      charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier
      does not suffer any penalty to his AC after making a charge attack while
      mounted.</p>
