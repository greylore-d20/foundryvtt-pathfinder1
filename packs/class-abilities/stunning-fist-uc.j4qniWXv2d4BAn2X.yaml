    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, the monk gains
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.GsjouI6B8X7BA5wN]{Stunning Fist} as a bonus feat,
      even if he does not meet the prerequisites.</p><p>At 4th level, and every
      4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition
      to the target of his <em>Stunning Fist</em>. This condition replaces
      stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still
      negates the effect.</p><p>At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the
      target fatigued.</p><p>At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1
      minute.</p><p>At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1
      rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the
      target.</p><p>At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1
      rounds.</p><p>The monk must choose which condition will apply before the
      attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a
      creature fatigued by <em>Stunning Fist</em> cannot become exhausted if hit
      by <em>Stunning Fist</em> again), but additional hits do increase the
      duration.</p>
