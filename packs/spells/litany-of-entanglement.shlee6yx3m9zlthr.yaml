    value: >-
      <p>Your litany conjures chains of energy that lash upward from the ground
      and hamper the target's movement. The target is entangled. This spell has
      no effect on flying creatures, or creatures not standing upon solid
      ground.  While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of
      another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.</p>
