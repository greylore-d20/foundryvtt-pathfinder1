      <p>Powdered chalk, flour, and similar materials are popular with
      adventurers for their utility in pinpointing <em>invisible</em> creatures.
      Throwing a bag of powder into a square is an attack against AC 5, and
      momentarily reveals if there is an <em>invisible</em> creature there. A
      much more effective method is to spread powder on a surface (which takes 1
      full round) and look for footprints.</p>
