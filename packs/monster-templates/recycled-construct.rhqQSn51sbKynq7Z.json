The patchwork nature of a recycled construct renders it fragile and leaves key circuitry exposed. reducing its bonus hit points by 5.<p>“Recycled construct” is an acquired template that can be added to a construct with 3 or more Hit Dice made predominantly of solid material. A recycled construct uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Base creature’s CR – 1.<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Reduce any damage reduction or hardness by 5. Replace any immunity to magic with spell resistance equal to the base creature’s CR + 11. Any exceptions to the base creature’s immunity to magic automatically bypass the recycled construct’s spell resistance and function as described for the base creature.<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> A recycled construct gains the following weakness.<p><em>Malfunction (Ex):</em> A recycled construct that takes precision damage or extra damage from a critical hit becomes staggered for 1 round and immediately triggers a malfunction. To determine the nature of this malfunction, roll 1d10 and consult the table on page 52 (CL = the base creature’s HD; save DC = 10 + the base creature’s HD). A creature can use a move action to attempt a special Disable Device check before dealing precision damage to a recycled construct (DC = 20 + the base creature’s HD). On a success, the attacking creature can roll twice and choose the malfunction result.</p>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>d10</b></td>\n<td><b>Malfunction</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>No additional effect</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Sparks fly from the construct, dazzling each adjacent creature that can see it (Fortitude negates).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>The construct flails wildly, making one melee attack against each adjacent creature.
