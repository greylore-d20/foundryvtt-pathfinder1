  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can apply a dose of contact or
      injury poison to it, as if applying poison to a weapon. If the poisoned
      bomb hits its target, the bomb deals damage as normal, but the target must
      also succeed at a saving throw against the poison or be affected by that
      poison. No other creatures are affected by the poison.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level and have the poison use class
      feature before selecting this discovery.</p>
