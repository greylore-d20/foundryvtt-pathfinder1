      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.27o3msobhyghmfid]{minor image}, except it
      always creates an animated illusion of you presenting to a vampire a
      material, object, or sound that it is averse to, such as garlic, a holy
      symbol, or bells ringing. You specify what aversion the illusion depicts
      when you cast the spell. The vampire reacts to the illusion as if it were
      real; it can overcome the effect by succeeding at a disbelief save or a
      normal Will save against the illusion's DC (instead of the normal DC 25 to
      overcome its revulsion). The illusion is only quasi-real and cannot
      otherwise affect creatures.</p>
