      "value": "<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium <em>animal</em> and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the <em>animal</em> type. This ability functions like the <em>beast shape I</em> spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to <em>animal</em> or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>\n<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in <em>animal</em> form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>\n<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, <em>elementals</em>, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny <em>animal</em> or a Small <em>elemental</em>. When taking the form of an <em>animal</em>, a druid’s wild shape now functions as <em>beast shape II</em>. When taking the form of an <em>elemental</em>, the druid’s wild shape functions as <em>elemental body I</em>.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive <em>animal</em>, a Medium <em>elemental</em>, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid’s wild shape now functions as <em>beast shape III</em>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid’s wild shape now functions as <em>elemental body II</em>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid’s wild shape functions as <em>plant shape I</em>.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large <em>elemental</em> or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an <em>elemental</em>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as <em>elemental body III</em>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as <em>plant shape II</em>.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge <em>elemental</em> or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an <em>elemental</em>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as <em>elemental body IV</em>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as <em>plant shape III</em>.</p>"
