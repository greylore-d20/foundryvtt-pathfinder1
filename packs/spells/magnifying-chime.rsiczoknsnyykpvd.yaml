      <p>You cause the touched object to vibrate and release sonic energy once
      per round as a loud, dangerous chime. The sound grows in strength as time
      passes. On your turn in the round after you cast the spell, the chime
      deals 1d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures and objects within 5
      feet of the target. Each round after that, the damage increases by 1d6 and
      reaches 5 feet farther in all directions. A successful Fortitude save
      halves the damage for that round only.</p>
