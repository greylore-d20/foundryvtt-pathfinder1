  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This staff has a cradle at the end, designed to hold alchemical weapons
      such as acid. A flask thrower significantly extends the range of thrown
      substances that deal splash damage, such as acid, alchemist's fire, or
      holy water, as well as that of tools such as tanglefoot bags,
      thunderstones, or caltrops.</p>
