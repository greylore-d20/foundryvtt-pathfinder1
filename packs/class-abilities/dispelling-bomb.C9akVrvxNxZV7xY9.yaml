  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel
      magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit
      from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic} spell, using the
      alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a
      specific spell effect.</p><p>The alchemist must be at least 6th level
      before selecting this discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link
