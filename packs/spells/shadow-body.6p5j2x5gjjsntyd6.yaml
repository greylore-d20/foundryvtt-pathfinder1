  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You exchange the crude matter of your material body with the
      insubstantial essence of the Plane of Shadow, becoming a living shadow
      yourself. You are visible as an unattached shadow in bright light or
      normal light, but you gain total concealment in dim light or darkness.
      Against creatures with darkvision, you gain concealment rather than total
      concealment. Your <i>shadow body</i> is incorporeal for most purposes,
      though you can't fly or pass through solid objects or creatures. However,
      you can move at your normal speed along any surface, including horizontal
      and vertical surfaces and liquids, and you are never slowed by difficult
      terrain. Your size doesn't change.  You can speak and cast spells and
      perform mental actions, but you have no physical substance and cannot
      manipulate objects or attack physically. You can deliver touch spells and
      effects as if making an incorporeal touch attack. Your equipment merges
      with your <i>shadow body</i>, so you can't cast spells with a material
      component unless those spells are prepared with Eschew Materials.</p>
