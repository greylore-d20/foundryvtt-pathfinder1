    value: >-
      <p>By rearranging the threads of fate, you disrupt fortunate outcomes for
      other creatures. A creature affected by this spell is unable to benefit
      from effects that grant the ability to roll multiple times and take the
      higher result (like the swashbuckler's charmed life ability) or to choose
      the die result in lieu of rolling (like the wizard's prescience school
      power or the cyclops's flash of insight ability). This doesn't affect
      abilities that force a creature to take the lower of two rolls, such as
      <i>ill omen</i> or a pugwampi's unluck aura (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
      2</i> 144). A cyclops can't use its flash of insight ability to save
      against this spell.</p>
