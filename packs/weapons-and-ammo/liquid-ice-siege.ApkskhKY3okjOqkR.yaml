    value: >-
      <p>This hard, ceramic canister filled with alchemical liquid ice can be
      used as ammunition in catapults and trebuchets.</p>

      <p>When it hits its target square, it deals <b>4d6 points of cold
      damage</b> to each creature within 5 feet of the targeting space, and each
      creature must make a <b>DC 20 Fortitude save</b> or become entangled for 1
      round.</p>

      <p>Every creature within the area between 5 and 30 feet of the target
      space must make a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take half damage.</p>

      <h3>Mishap</h3>

      <p>On a siege engine mishap, this ammunition explodes before it is
      launched, dealing its damage to all nearby creatures as if one of the
      spaces of the siege engine (crew leader's choice) were the target
      square.</p>
