    value: >-
      <p>A creature that fails its save uses an immediate action to hand you
      whatever object it's currently wielding or holding. If the target doesn't
      have an immediate action available, it uses a move action at the beginning
      of its next turn to hand you the object. If it's currently holding or
      wielding more than one item, determine randomly which item it gives you.
      If you're no longer adjacent to the creature when it has to give you the
      item, the spell ends with no effect. A creature that isn't holding an item
      when you cast this spell is unaffected.</p>
