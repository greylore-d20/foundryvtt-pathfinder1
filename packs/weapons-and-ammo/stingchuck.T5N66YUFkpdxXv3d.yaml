      <b>Critical</b> x2; <b>Range</b> 10 ft.; <b>Type</b>
      B</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A stingchuck is a foul bag made of a
      humanoid's head with the brain removed and the skull heavily scored so
      that it bursts open when thrown. Normally filled with biting vermin, it
      acts as a splash weapon. When it hits, the vermin bite and sting the
      target, dealing 1d6 points of damage and forcing a DC 11 Fortitude save to
      avoid being nauseated for 1d3 rounds. Each round a creature remains
      nauseated by a stingchuck, it takes 1 additional point of damage from the
      biting vermin. All creatures within the splash effect take 1 point of
      damage from the vermin but do not risk being nauseated.</p>
