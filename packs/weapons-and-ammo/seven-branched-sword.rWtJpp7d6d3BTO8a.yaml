  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This unusual sword has a straight 2-foot-long blade with six shorter
      L-shaped blades protruding from it, three on each side in a staggered
      pattern. The shorter blades can be used to snag opponents' clothing or
      armor, or can target weapons in order to disarm them. To snag armor or
      clothing, the attacker makes a trip attempt. If successful, the victim
      doesn't fall prone, but instead is snagged and stumbles forward, leaving
      the victim flat-footed for the remainder of the round.</p>
