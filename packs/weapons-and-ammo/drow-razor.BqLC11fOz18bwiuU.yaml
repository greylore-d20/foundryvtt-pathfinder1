  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Meant for quick strikes and slashes, this long, slender knife is
      incredibly sharp along one edge. Drow swashbucklers and assassins are
      particularly fond of these weapons. A confirmed critical hit or successful
      sneak attack with a drow razor deals an additional 2 points of damage;
      this damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A
      character with the drow's weapon familiarity racial trait treats the drow
      razor as a martial weapon.</p>
