      <p>Capable of calling upon the power of the gods in the form of blessings
      and spells, warpriests blend divine magic with martial skill. They are
      unflinching bastions of their faith, shouting gospel as they pummel foes
      into submission, and never shy away from a challenge to their beliefs.
      While clerics might be subtle and use diplomacy to accomplish their aims,
      warpriests aren’t above using violence whenever the situation warrants it.
      In many faiths, warpriests form the core of the church’s martial
      forces—reclaiming lost relics, rescuing captured clergy, and defending the
      church’s tenets from all challenges.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Warpriests can serve as capable healers or spellcasters,
      calling upon their divine powers from the center of the fight, where their
      armor and martial skills are put to the test.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: A warpriest’s alignment must be within one step of
      his deity’s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>

      <p><b>Parent Classes</b>: <em>Cleric</em> and <em>fighter</em>.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175 gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>

      <h2>Class Skills</h2>

      <p>The warpriest’s class skills are Climb (Str),
      Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),

      Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex),
