      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that transforms magical energy. Choose an energy type from acid, cold, electricity, and fire, and a second type to transform it into. Any magical source of energy of this type with a <em>caster level</em> equal to or less than your wizard level is altered to the chosen energy type. This includes <em>supernatural</em> effects from creatures with <em>Hit Dice</em> no greater than your <em>caster level</em>. For example, you could transform a <em>white dragon’s</em> frigid breath weapon (a <em>supernatural</em> ability), but not a <em>fire elemental’s</em> fiery touch (an extraordinary ability). If an effect lies only partially within your aura, only the portions within the aura are transformed. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>"
