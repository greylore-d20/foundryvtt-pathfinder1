  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can enter a deep meditation, blocking out visual and auditory
      stimuli and allowing you to concentrate on a single problem, philosophical
      issue, or memory. This trance lasts 1d6 rounds, during which time you can
      only take move actions. During this period, you gain a bonus equal to your
      level on all saves against sonic effects and gaze attacks. When you come
      out of your trance, you may make a single Intelligence-based skill check
      with a +20 circumstance bonus. You may enter your focused trance a number
      of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
