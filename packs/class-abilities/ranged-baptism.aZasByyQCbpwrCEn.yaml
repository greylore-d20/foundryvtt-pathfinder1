    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist uses holy water as a splash weapon, any squares
      subject to its effects (including creatures affected by splash damage) or
      that contain creatures subject to its effects are also affected as if by
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zpav8ywcqwkcuojw]{Consecrate}, for a number of
      rounds equal to the alchemistâ€™s Intelligence modifier. Undead struck by
      holy water remain affected by the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zpav8ywcqwkcuojw]{Consecrate} effect even if they
      leave the affected area.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
