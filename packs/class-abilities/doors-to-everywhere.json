      "value": "<p>As a standard action, the shaman can step through any door and instantly exit through another distant doorway. Regardless of what spell this functions as, it can transport only you, and both your departure and arrival spaces must be adjacent to a door or similar opening. Initially, this functions as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.99ihqk5u93smyy9x]{Jester's Jaunt}.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, the shaman can use this ability as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{Dimension Door}.</p>\n<p>At 14th level, the shaman can use this ability as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.6x6epf4g5wgzl1gh]{Tree Stride} (treating all doors as generic coniferous trees).</p>\n<p>You can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and at 20th level.</p>"
