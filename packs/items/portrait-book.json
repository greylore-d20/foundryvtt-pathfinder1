      "value": "<p><b>Portrait Book</b> This 100-page book contains face drawings of male and female dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, halflings, and humans. By selecting an appropriate drawing and adding hair, beard, or other small features such as moles or scars, even a poor artist can quickly create a reasonable likeness of a specific person- for example, an inquisitor making wanted posters of a half-elven witch. <b>Price</b> 10 gp; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1115</em></p>"
