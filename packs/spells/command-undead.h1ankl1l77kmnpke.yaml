  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead creature. If the
    subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions favorably (treat
    its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You
    can give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to
    convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. Retries are not
    allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously
    harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is
    worth doing.</p><p>A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw
    against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate
    only basic commands, such as "come here," "go there," "fight," "stand
    still," and so on. Nonintelligent undead won't resist suicidal or obviously
    harmful orders.</p><p>Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens
    the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the
    spell.</p><p>Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be
    able to hear you.</p>
