      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Black powder is the key explosive component within a firearm that
      enables it to function, but in larger amounts this alchemical material can
      be quite destructive on its own as well. A single dose of black powder is
      enough to power a single shot from most one-handed and two-handed
      firearms, while 10 doses are required to fire a cannon. Black powder is
      often stored and transported in kegs (which hold 100 doses), but in this
      quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous. Exposure to fire,
      electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder to explode—a
      single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of fire damage to
      anyone within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing black powder in
      a powder horn protects the powder from explosion.</p>
