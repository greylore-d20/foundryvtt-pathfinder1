      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>A skilled artificer can revitalize a
      ruined construct by jury-rigging the pieces left intact. The patchwork
      nature of a recycled construct renders it fragile and leaves key circuitry
      exposed. reducing its bonus hit points by 5.<p>“Recycled construct” is an
      acquired template that can be added to a construct with 3 or more Hit Dice
      made predominantly of solid material. A recycled construct uses all the
      base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted
      here.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Base creature’s CR – 1.<p><b>Defensive
      Abilities:</b> Reduce any damage reduction or hardness by 5. Replace any
      immunity to magic with spell resistance equal to the base creature’s CR +
      11. Any exceptions to the base creature’s immunity to magic automatically
      bypass the recycled construct’s spell resistance and function as described
      for the base creature.<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> A recycled construct gains the
      following weakness.<p><em>Malfunction (Ex):</em> A recycled construct that
      takes precision damage or extra damage from a critical hit becomes
      staggered for 1 round and immediately triggers a malfunction. To determine
      the nature of this malfunction, roll 1d10 and consult the table on page 52
      (CL = the base creature’s HD; save DC = 10 + the base creature’s HD). A
      creature can use a move action to attempt a special Disable Device check
      before dealing precision damage to a recycled construct (DC = 20 + the
      base creature’s HD). On a success, the attacking creature can roll twice
      and choose the malfunction result.</p>
