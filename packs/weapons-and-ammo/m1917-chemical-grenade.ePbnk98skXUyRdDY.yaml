  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The M1917 is a modified M1914 grenade specially modified and enlarged
      to release a cloud of toxic gas upon detonation. Resembling an overlarge
      metal can with a small lever and handle protruding from the bottom, the
      grenade is armed by pulling back on a metal firing pin held in place by
      the handle's depressed lever, which is released when thrown.</p>

      <p>At the beginning of your next turn, the grenade spews forth a cloud of
      mustard gas (see the sidebar on this page) in a 20-foot radius. The cloud
      disperses naturally after 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the
      cloud in 1 round.</p>
