      "value": "<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using <em>Survival</em> to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a <em>standard action</em>, make a single attack against a <em>favored enemy</em> at his full <em>attack bonus</em>. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a <em>Fortitude</em> save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger’s level + the ranger’s <em>Wisdom</em> modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of <em>nonlethal damage</em> equal to the creature’s current <em>hit points</em>. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each <em>favored enemy</em> type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>"
