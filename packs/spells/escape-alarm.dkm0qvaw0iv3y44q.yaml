  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You place a ward on an area that notifies you when a creature exits it.
      This functions as <i>alarm</i>, except as noted. It alerts you when a
      creature leaves, rather than enters, the area, and you can't select a
      password to bypass its effects. Instead, when you place an escape
      <i>alarm</i>, you can attune up to one additional creature per caster
      level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to your own escape
      <i>alarm</i> and don't count against the limit. Attuned creatures can
      enter and exit the spell's area without triggering the <i>alarm</i>. If
      you select a mental <i>alarm</i> rather than an audible one, all attuned
      creatures receive the mental alert when someone exits the warded area.</p>
