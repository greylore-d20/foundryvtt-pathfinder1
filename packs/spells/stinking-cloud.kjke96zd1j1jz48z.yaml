      <p><i>Stinking cloud</i> creates a bank of fog like that created by <i>fog
      cloud</i>, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the
      cloud become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in
      the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves.</p><p>(Roll separately for
      each nauseated character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but
      remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. This
      is a poison effect.</p><p><i>Stinking cloud</i> can be made permanent with
      a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>stinking cloud</i> dispersed by
      wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>
