  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can alter an existing spell effect by expending 1 point
      from her arcane reservoir. To use this ability, she must be adjacent to
      the spell effect (or the effectâ€™s target) and be aware of the effect. She
      can choose to increase or decrease the remaining duration of the spell by
      50%. This ability can be used on unwilling targets, but the arcanist must
      succeed at a melee touch attack, and the target may attempt a Will saving
      throw to negate the effect. This ability cannot be used on a given spell
      effect more than once. This ability has no effect on spells that are
      instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.</p>
