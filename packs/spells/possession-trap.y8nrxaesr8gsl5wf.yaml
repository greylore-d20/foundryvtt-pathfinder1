  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You place a protective ward over your spirit that ensnares creatures
      attempting to possess you. Should a creature attempt to possess you (such
      as via <i>magic jar</i> or a similar effect) while you are under the
      effects of <i>possession trap</i>, that creature must first succeed at a
      Will save or its possession attempt is ruined and its spirit is shunted
      into this spell's focus gem. The trapped creature is contained within the
      focus gem for 1 round per caster level, acting as though it were trapped
      in a <i>magic jar</i> for the duration of this effect. This effect fails
      if you are not carrying the focus gem during the time of the possession
      attempt.</p><p>If the possessor's Will save is successful, you are
      affected by its possession attempt as normal, and may attempt a saving
      throw against this possession attempt if one is normally allowed.
      Regardless of whether the possessor fails or succeeds at its save against
      <i>possession trap</i>, you immediately become aware of the possession
      attempt and whether or not a creature is trapped in the focus gem. If the
      focus gem is destroyed while it contains a creature, the creature is
      immediately released.</p><p>Once this spell is triggered, it offers no
      further protection, and a trapped creature can attempt to possess you
      again once it's free of the focus gem.</p>
