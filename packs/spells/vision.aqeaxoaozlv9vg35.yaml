  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>legend lore,</i> except that it works more
      quickly and produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some
      person, place, or object, then cast the spell. If the person or object is
      at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about
      it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 + 1 per caster level;
      maximum +25) against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person,
      place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is
      incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information
      gained is vague. After this spell is complete, you are fatigued.</p>
