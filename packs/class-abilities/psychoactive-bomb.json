      "value": "<p>Psychoactive bombs are mixed with neurotoxic extracts that heighten certain sensations. A creature struck by a psychoactive bomb takes a â€“1 penalty on saving throws against charm, emotion, fear, and pain effects, and the DC for Intimidate checks against the victim decreases by 2. This effect lasts for 1 hour per alchemist level. These penalties do not stack, and a creature can only be affected by a single psychoactive bomb at a time. A psychoactive bomb deals 1d6 fewer hit points of damage than normal.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
