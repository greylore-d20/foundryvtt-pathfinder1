      <p>A perfume kit consists of an atomizer and a diverse array of perfumes,
      scented oils, wild flowers, and herbs. Applying scents from a perfume kit
      takes 1 minute, and grants you a +1 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on
      <em>Bluff</em>, <em>Diplomacy</em>, <em>Disguise</em>, <em>Handle
      Animal</em>, <em>Intimidate</em>, or <em>Perform</em> checks, subject to
      GM discretion.</p>

      <p>You must choose the type of check when you apply the fragrances.</p>

      <p>This bonus typically doesn't apply in combat or against hostile
      creatures, and might not work on creatures without olfactory senses or who
      would be more offended than entranced by your <em>scent</em>. The bonus
      lasts for 4 hours. You can gain only one bonus from a perfume kit at a
      time, and the bonus from <em>perfume</em> does not stack with bonuses from
      any masterwork tools you possess for the same skill. A perfume kit is
      <em>exhausted</em> after 10 uses.</p>
