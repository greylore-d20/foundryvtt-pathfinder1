    value: >-
      <p>The blood of the targeted creatures begins to boil. If a target fails
      its save, it takes 1 point of fire damage per round. This spell has no
      effect on creatures that don't have blood.  If a target has the orc
      subtype, it doesn't take fire damage and instead gains a +2 morale bonus
      to Strength.</p>
