  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can cause a creature to take on some of the traits of the undead
      with a melee touch attack. Touched creatures are treated as undead for the
      purposes of effects that heal or cause damage based on positive and
      negative energy. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2
      your cleric level (minimum 1). It does not apply to the Turn Undead or
      Command Undead feats. You can use this ability a number of times per day
      equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Bleeding Touch power of the Death Domain.</p>
