  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per rage, the barbarian can make a disarm attempt against a target
      in place of a melee attack. This attempt does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. If successful, the barbarian sends the target’s weapon
      flying—either straight at the target, or spinning away to strike another
      foe up to 20 feet away. This ranged attack counts as <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Weapons&amp;Category=Equipment">throwing
      a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown</a>, even if the weapon disarmed
      is a thrown weapon. The barbarian makes a ranged attack, which doesn’t
      provoke attacks of opportunity, at either the target of his disarm
      maneuver or another creature within 20 feet. If the barbarian is aiming
      for the disarmed creature, the foe doesn’t count as being in melee for
      determining any penalty on the ranged attack from throwing a ranged weapon
      into melee. If the ranged attack hits, the disarmed weapon deals damage as
      if the barbarian had thrown it. The barbarian can choose to aim the
      disarmed weapon at a square rather than at a foe.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
