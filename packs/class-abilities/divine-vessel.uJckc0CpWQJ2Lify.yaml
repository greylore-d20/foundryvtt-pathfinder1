    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you are the target of a divine spell, you can, as a swift
      action, grant each ally within 15 feet of you a divine boon. This boon
      grants a +2 bonus on the next attack roll, skill check, or ability check
      made before the end of their next turn. You can use this ability a number
      of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Hand of the Acolyte power of the Arcane
      Domain.</p>
