      <i>You can make a single attack that deals incredible damage.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Improved Vital Strike, Vital Strike, base attack bonus +16.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>When you use the attack action, you can make one attack at your highest
      base attack bonus that deals additional damage. Roll the weapon's damage
      dice for the attack four times and add the results together before adding
      bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as <i>flaming</i>),
      precision based damage, and other damage bonuses. These extra weapon
      damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit, but are added to the
      total.</p>
