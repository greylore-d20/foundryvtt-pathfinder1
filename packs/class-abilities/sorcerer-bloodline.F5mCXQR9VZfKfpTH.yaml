    value: >-
      <p>Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in her heritage that
      grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional class skill, and other
      special abilities. This source can represent a blood relation or an
      extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family's past. For
      example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a distant relative or her
      grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless
      of the source, this inf luence manifests in a number of ways as the
      sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her
      first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
