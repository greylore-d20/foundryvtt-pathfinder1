      <p>The touched items levitate in your space. When you cast the spell and
      once per round thereafter, you can launch one item at a target of your
      choice as a standard action. The ranged attack is made as if you had
      thrown the item unless it's ammunition for a weapon, in which case the
      attack is made as if fired from a heavy crossbow (if a bolt), a halfling
      sling staff (if a sling bullet), a blowgun (if a blowgun dart), a
      composite longbow with a +2 Strength rating (if an arrow), an atlatlUE (if
      an atlatl dart), or a pistolUE (if a firearm bulletUE). A firearm pelletUE
      launched by the spell functions as a shuriken.  When you launch ammunition
      with this spell, you don't take a penalty on your attack rolls for lacking
      proficiency with the ammunition's weapon; you do, however, take the usual
      -4 penalty for throwing an improvised weapon if you launch an item not
      intended to be used as a weapon. The attack roll uses your caster level in
      place of your base attack bonus and your Intelligence or Charisma modifier
      (whichever is higher) in place of your Dexterity modifier. <b>Range</b>
      increment and proficiency penalties apply as normal. The attack has an
      effective Strength bonus, if applicable, equal to the higher of your
      Intelligence and Charisma modifiers. The spell is discharged when all
      touched items have been launched.</p>
