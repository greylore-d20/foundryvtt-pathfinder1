  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Upon the casting of this spell, complete <i>silence</i> prevails in the
    affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with
    verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from,
    enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in
    space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The
    spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the
    creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will
    save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a
    creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of
    saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do
    not. Creatures in an area of a <i>silence</i> spell are immune to sonic or
    language-based attacks, spells, and effects.</p>
