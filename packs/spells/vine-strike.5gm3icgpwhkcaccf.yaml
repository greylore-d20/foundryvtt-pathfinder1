  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Bristles burst from your body, lodging in your opponent and blossoming
      into entangling vines as you pummel your target. While this spell is in
      effect, one of your natural attacks or unarmed strikes deals an additional
      1d6 points of damage, and each creature hit with that natural weapon or
      unarmed strike must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled for the
      duration of the spell; on a successful Reflex save, the creature is immune
      to the entangled effect for 1 round. A creature entangled by this spell
      can spend a standard action to remove the vines, but can be entangled
      again by further unarmed strikes.</p>
