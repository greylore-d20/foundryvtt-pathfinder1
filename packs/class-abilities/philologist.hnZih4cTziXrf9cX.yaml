    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can reroll any Linguistics skill check
      made to decipher writing in an unfamiliar language, and never risks
      drawing a false conclusion from a failed Wisdom check after a failed
      Linguistics check. A character with this talent is allowed only one reroll
      per inscription, message, or text encountered.</p>
