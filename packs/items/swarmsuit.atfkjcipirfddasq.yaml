  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These heavy and overlapping layers of clothing, coupled with a wide hat
      outfitted with a dense, veil-like netting around its brim makes it all but
      impossible for Diminutive and Fine creatures to make physical contact with
      your body. Wearing a swarmsuit cuts your speed in half, but gives you
      <em>DR</em> 10/- against <em>swarms</em> of Fine creatures and <em>DR</em>
      5/- against <em>swarms</em> of Diminutive creatures.</p>
