      <p>This spell makes it difficult for the subject to cast arcane spells,
      use spell-like abilities, and use some abilities granted by arcane
      spellcasting classes. The subject must succeed at a concentration check
      (DC = 10 + 1/2 its caster level) in order to cast an arcane spell, use any
      spell-like ability (even those that come from a divine source), use arcane
      spell completion or spell trigger magic items, or use any of the following
      class features that come from an arcane spellcasting class: arcane school
      powers, arcanist exploits, bardic performances, magus arcana, or witch
      hexes. Spells, spell-like abilities, or class features that take a free,
      swift, or immediate action aren't affected by this spell, nor are mythic
      spells or mythic powers.  While under the effect of this spell, if the
      subject must attempt a concentration check to cast an arcane spell or use
      an arcane spell-like ability for any reason other than the effect of this
      spell (such as casting defensively, being injured while casting, and so
      on), it takes a penalty on that check equal to 1/2 its caster level.</p>
