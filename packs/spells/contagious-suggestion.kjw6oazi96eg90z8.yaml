  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as per <i>suggestion</i>, except the target can
      pass on the enchantment to other targets. The target is compelled to
      communicate your <i>suggestion</i> to another creature, forcing the new
      target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial target. If a
      secondary target successfully saves, the <i>suggestion</i> effect on the
      initial target isn't negated. If a secondary target fails, it is placed
      under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread the
      <i>suggestion</i>. This spell can affect a total number of Hit Dice of
      creatures equal to your caster level. Creatures that save against this
      spell cannot be affected by that particular casting of contagious
      <i>suggestion</i> for 24 hours.</p>
