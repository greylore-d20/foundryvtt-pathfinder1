      <p><em>Poisonous cloud</em> creates a bank of fog like that created by
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{fog cloud}, except that the
      vapors are toxic. The cloud deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage per
      round to living creatures that fail their Fortitude saves. A creature that
      succeeds at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to attempt a
      new saving throw each round on your turn.</p><p><em>Poisonous cloud</em>
      can be made permanent with a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.nsxngq65mbrzgwnm]{permanency} spell cast by a
      caster of 13th level or higher, at a cost of 12,500 gp. A permanent
      <em>poisonous cloud</em> dispersed by wind re-forms in 10 minutes.</p>
