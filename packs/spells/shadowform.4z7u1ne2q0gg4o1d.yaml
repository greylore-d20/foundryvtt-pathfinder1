  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You replace the target's body with mystic shadow material drawn from the
    Shadow Plane, rendering the target's physical form only quasi-real. Whenever
    a foe tries to directly attack the target of the spell (for instance, with a
    weapon or a targeted spell), that foe must attempt a Will save to
    disbelieve. If successful, the opponent can attack the target normally and
    is unaffected by <i>shadowform</i> for 1 round. If the foe fails, the target
    takes only one-fifth the normal amount of damage from the foe's successful
    attack or effect, and if the attack has a special effect other than damage,
    that effect is one-fifth as strong as normal (if applicable) or only 20% as
    likely to occur. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against
    this spell.</p>
