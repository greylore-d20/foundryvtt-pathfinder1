  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes spines to grow from your exposed skin, damaging
      creatures that strike you. Any creature striking you with a melee weapon,
      an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage
      +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures using melee weapons
      with reach are unaffected by this spell. Creatures that successfully
      grapple you take 2d6 points of piercing damage +1 point per caster level
      (maximum +15). In addition, your natural attacks and unarmed strikes deal
      an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage.</p><p>Thorns created by this
      spell persist through any new physical shape or form you assume, such as
      via wildshape or any polymorph effect.</p>
