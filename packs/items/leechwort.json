Gather DC 16; <b>Yield</b> 1d4 doses</p>\r\n<p><b>Terrain</b> warm forests or swamps</p>\r\n<p><b>Preparation</b> Properly preparing leechwort for use is a time-consuming process that takes 1 week, as fibers of the shrub must be dried and ground until they achieve a fine, powdery texture. A single herbalist can prepare up to a dozen doses simultaneously in this manner. At the end of the week, a successful DC 15 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check results in all of the doses being ready for use; failure indicates that all the doses have spoiled.</p>\r\n<p><b>Use</b> When a dose of prepared leechwort is used in conjunction with a <em>Heal</em> check to <em>stabilize</em> a <em>dying</em> creature, provide long-term care, treat wounds from caltrops (or similar effects), or treat deadly wounds, it grants a +1 <em>alchemical bonus</em> on the <em>Heal</em> check. This increases to a +2 <em>alchemical bonus</em> on <em>Heal</em> checks to staunch bleeding.</p>\r\n"
