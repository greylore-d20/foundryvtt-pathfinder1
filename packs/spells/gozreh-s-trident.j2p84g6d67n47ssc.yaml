  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A 4-foot-long, blazing, forked bolt of electricity springs forth from
      your hand. You wield this spear-like bolt as if it were a trident (you are
      considered proficient with the bolt). Attacks with Gozreh's trident are
      melee touch attacks. The bolt deals 1d8 points of electricity damage + 1
      point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). Since the bolt is immaterial,
      your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. The bolt can ignite
      combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.</p>
