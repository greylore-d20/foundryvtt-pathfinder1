    value: >-
      <p>A metal cage behind this arrow's point contains flammable material. You
      take a -1 penalty on attack rolls when firing incendiary arrows. You can
      light up to six incendiary arrows as a full-round action (a standard
      action if you use a tindertwig) that provokes attacks of
      opportunity.</p><p>Once lit, the arrow burns for 2 rounds. A lit
      incendiary arrow deals an additional 1 point of fire damage. On a critical
      hit, the target must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or catch
      fire.</p><p>Incendiary bolts exist for crossbows.</p>
