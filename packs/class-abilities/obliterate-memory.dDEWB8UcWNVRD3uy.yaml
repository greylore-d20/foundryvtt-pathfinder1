      <p>As a standard action, you can target a creature within 30 feet and
      eliminate all memory of an event the target experienced, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.5ll7q13p0skbgonc]{Modify Memory}. A target can
      attempt a Will save to negate this effect. In addition, you can cause an
      account of the memory erased by this ability to appear on a blank page of
      any book you are carrying.</p><p>You can use this ability once per day,
      plus one additional time per day at 15th level.</p><p>You must be at least
      11th level to select this revelation.</p>
