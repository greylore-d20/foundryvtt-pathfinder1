    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you can manifest a pair of translucent, cloud-like
      wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, your speed increases to 90 feet and your maneuverability
      increases to perfect.</p>

      <p>You can use these wings for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This
      duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute
      increments.</p>
