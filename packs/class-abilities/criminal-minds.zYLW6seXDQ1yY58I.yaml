  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can touch a creature and fill its mind with criminal impulses. This
      otherwise functions as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.q986nbkaq8kwbcy2]{Crime
      Of Opportunity}, though a target that fails its saving throw and acts on
      an impulse gets those desires out of its system and becomes immune to the
      effects of your criminal minds ability for 24 hours. You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier
      (minimum 1).</p>
