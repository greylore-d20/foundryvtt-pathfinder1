It takes a full-round action to set up the carriage. The carriage has a hind leg, allowing the wielder to wheel the device about and immediately prop it for stability during combat.</p>\n<p>Unlike other two-handed firearms, you must fire the double hackbut while it is mounted, or else firing it imparts a -4 penalty on attack rolls and the recoil knocks you prone. A Large or larger creature can fire a double hackbut one size smaller than itself without the gun's mounting as a normal two-handed weapon and without the danger of being knocked prone, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately sized weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an early firearm.</strong></p>"
