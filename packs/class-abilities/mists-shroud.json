This grants the creature concealment as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.18kryvj2dfuymk9d]{Blur} spell. The mist dissipates after it causes an attack to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>At 8th and 16th levels, the mist lasts for one additional attack.</p>\n<p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>"
