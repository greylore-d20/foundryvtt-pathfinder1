  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target becomes filled with intense magical light, taking 2d6 points
    of damage as the light bursts from its wounds and orifices (if the target is
    an undead creature, it instead takes 2d8 points of damage). In addition, the
    creature radiates bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light
    level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area-darkness
    becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes
    bright light. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while
    within the 30-foot radius of this magical light. A successful Will save
    halves the damage and negates the light effect.  For every 4 character
    levels you possess, the light continues to fill the creature for another
    round (to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level), though the target may make a
    Will save each round to halve the damage and end the effect. Any creature
    adjacent to the target that fails its save and takes damage takes half as
    much damage and is blinded for 1 round. A successful Reflex save halves this
    damage (to a total of one-quarter the damage taken by the target) and
    negates the blindness effect.</p>
