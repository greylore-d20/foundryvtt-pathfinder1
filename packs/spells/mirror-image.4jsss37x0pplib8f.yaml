  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your
    square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and
    attack you.</p><p>When <i>mirror image</i> is cast, 1d4 images plus one
    image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are
    created.</p><p>These images remain in your space and move with you,
    mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are
    attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is
    a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the
    attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or
    a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack
    misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss.
    Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments.
    Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally
    and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack
    are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.</p><p>An attacker
    must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the
    attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances
    still apply).</p>
