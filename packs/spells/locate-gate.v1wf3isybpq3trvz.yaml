    value: >-
      <p>You sense the direction of the nearest <i><i>teleport</i>ation
      circle</i> (permanent or with a remaining duration), <i>gate</i> spell, or
      other effect which magically connects two different locations (for
      example, an active magic item, a creature's special ability, or unique
      adventure location). Locate <i>gate</i> detects only spells or effects
      with a permanent or ongoing duration, not instantaneous effects like
      <i>dimension door</i> or <i>teleport</i>.  Locate <i>gate</i> can be
      blocked by spells like <i>nondetection</i>, if the effect originates from
      a specific object or creature. However, spell effects can't likewise be
      warded. For example, ring <i>gate</i>s are a specific object, but a
      permanent <i><i>teleport</i>ation circle</i> is not (the surface in which
      it's inscribed doesn't count). Locate <i>gate</i> isn't blocked by lead,
      water, or other physical environmental conditions, but it is blocked by
      any intervening area that is dimensionally warded (such as by
      <i>dimensional lock</i> or forbiddance).</p>
