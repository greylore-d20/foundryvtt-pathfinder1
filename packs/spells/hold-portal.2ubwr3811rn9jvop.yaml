    value: >-
      <p>This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of
      wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were
      securely closed and normally locked. A <i>knock</i> spell or a successful
      <i>dispel magic</i> spell can negate a <i>hold portal</i> spell.</p><p>Add
      5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this spell.</p>
