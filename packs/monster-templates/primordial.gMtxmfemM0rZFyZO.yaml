      <p><b>Attacks</b> the damage dice for one primary natural weapon increases
      as if the creature were one size larger (if the creature has more than one
      primary attack, the increased damage is applied to the first attack type
      it has from this list: bite, claw, slam, gore, talon, sting);</p>
