      <p>This spell ensures the subject touched is always able to display her
      proper crest and coat of arms. Any tabard or tunic worn and any shield
      carried by the subject while this spell is active can be made to display a
      coat of arms when the spell is cast. For example, even if the subject
      picks up a different shield, it still displays the subject's crest,
      regardless of the shield's normal appearance.</p>
