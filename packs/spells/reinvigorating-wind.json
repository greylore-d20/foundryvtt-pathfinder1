Fascinated allies are shaken free of the fascinate effect. Flat-footed allies no longer count as flat-footed even if they have not acted yet. The duration of effects that cause any allies to be confused, frightened, paralyzed, slowed, or stunned is decreased by 1d4 rounds (roll separately for each target). If the duration of any such effect is reduced to 0 rounds or fewer, the effect ends for that ally. Finally, any allies lying prone may stand up as an immediate action, provoking attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>",
