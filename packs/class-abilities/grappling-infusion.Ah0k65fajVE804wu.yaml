      none</p>

      <p>Your cloud, deadly earth, or wall blast grows tendrils that hold your
      enemies in place. Whenever a creature takes damage from the infused blast,
      you can attempt a combat maneuver check to have the blast grapple that
      opponent. Your bonus on this check is equal to 2 + your kineticist level +
      your Constitution modifier (treat the blast as a Huge creature). The blast
      only grapples opponents; it canâ€™t perform other functions of grapple
      maneuvers such as pinning or moving the opponent.</p>

      <p>If the blast is already grappling an opponent, it receives a +5 bonus
      on its combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple, as normal. You can
      use this infusion only if you also use the cloud, deadly earth, or wall
      form infusion.</p>
