  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Elemental rage powers can be selected by any barbarian or skald who is
      at least 6th level and has the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.EKF5SHvuXhOjf2K6]{elemental
      stance},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.Xko4IAyi99g3ED4R]{lesser
      elemental rage}, or
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.GO8UFCvveERbDZoG]{lesser
      elemental blood} rage power. A barbarian or skald can use only one of
      these rage powers at a time, and an unchained barbarian must adopt the
      elemental stance to do so.</p><p>When raging, the barbarian can use
      Stealth, and she gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her barbarian level on Stealth
      checks plus the benefits of concealment against ranged attacks and attacks
      of opportunity.</p>
