Such attacks deal 1d4 points of nonlethal damage in addition to their normal damage, though creatures immune  to mind-affecting or pain effects ignore this additional damage. In addition, when you confirm a critical hit, the target is confused for 1 round by the pain. Creatures immune to critical hits, mind-affecting, or pain effects ignore the confusion. Even if you confirm multiple critical hits while this spell is in effect, an individual creature can only be confused by a single casting of <i>mindshock</i> once.</p>"
