      <p class="source">Constructed to resist the effects of hot environments
      (such as forest fires and areas of volcanic activity), this set of
      overlapping, heavy leather clothing includes a pair of fire-resistant
      boots. The outfit grants <em>fire resistance</em> 1, but exposure to fire
      damage ruins the outfit after 20 rounds.</p>
