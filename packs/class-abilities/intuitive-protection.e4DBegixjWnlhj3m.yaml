  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a conjuration (summoning) spell is cast by an opponent and the
      magus successfully identifies the spell with a Spellcraft check, he can
      spend 1 point form his arcane pool as an immediate action to cast
      protection from chaos, evil, good, or law (chosen when using this ability)
      on himself; this lasts a number of rounds equal to his magus level. At 7th
      level, he can instead cast magic circle against chaos, evil, good, or law
      when using this ability.</p>

      <p>The magus must be at least 3rd level before selecting this arcana.</p>
