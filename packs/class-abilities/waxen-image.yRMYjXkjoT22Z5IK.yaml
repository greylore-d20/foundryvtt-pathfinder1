      <p>The witch can spend a full-round action to create a crude and unnerving
      wax duplicate of a creature she can see within 30 feet. Once the image is
      complete, the subject must make a Will save. If the subject fails, the
      witch gains a small measure of control over the creature. Whenever she
      exercises this control, the creature receives a new Will save to end the
      effect. This effect occurs on the witch's turn and does not impede the
      creature's actions on its turn.</p><p>The witch can use the waxen image a
      number of times equal to her Intelligence modifier before it
      melts.</p><p>As a standard action, the witch can cause the subject to do
      any one of the following things: move up to the creature's speed in any
      direction, attack itself once with any weapon in hand (this attack
      automatically hits), lay down on the ground, or drop anything
      held.</p><p>Alternatively, she can spend one of her uses to simply torture
      the image, causing the creature to be both sickened and staggered on its
      turn.</p><p>As soon as the creature has succeeded on a saving throw
      against this effect, it is immune to it for 24 hours.</p><p>The is an
      enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p>
