  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Commonly known as a whip sword, this deadly weapon is fashioned from
      one to four 5-foot-long, razor-sharp blades of flexible steel, almost like
      a metal cato'- nine-tails. The weapon is wielded by whipping the blades at
      one's opponent. The coiled blade is fine and flexible enough to be worn as
      a belt, and its wielders often carry the blades wrapped around themselves
      in this fashion.</p>
