      <p>This spell functions like the spell completion option of <i>trap the
      soul</i>, except it works only on bodiless souls (such as incorporeal
      undead or a soul trapped in a gem) and creatures whose substance is a
      physical incarnation of a soul (such as a petitioner). It does not work on
      creatures formed from souls or planar material (such as most outsiders).
      <i>Soul transfer</i> is mainly used to transfer souls from one receptacle
      to another, but it can also be used to capture vulnerable souls that
      aren't bound to mortal flesh (such as incorporeal creatures and
      petitioners). When used to capture a petitioner, the petitioner's physical
      body vanishes, reappearing only when its soul is released from the
      receptacle.</p>
