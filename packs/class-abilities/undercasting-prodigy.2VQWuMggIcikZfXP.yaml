  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 9th level, whenever you gain a new level of spells, you
      automatically replace any psychic <em>bloodline</em> spells that can be
      undercast with the highest-level version you can cast in your list of
      spells known. For example, at 9th level, you would replace mind thrust I,
      id insinuation I, and ego whip I with mind thrust IV, id insinuation III,
      and ego whip II, respectively, as spells known.</p>
