      "value": "<p>You suffer from a minor form of lycanthropy. The exact animal your body and mind are aligned with can vary, but you should choose an animal that matches your faith thematically. In times of stress or unease, you cannot speakâ€”only growl and snarl like an animal. This ability works similarly to the tongues curse, but whenever you are in combat, you cannot speak at all. This does not interfere with spellcasting but does apply to spells that are language dependent. A character under the effects of&nbsp;speak with animals&nbsp;can understand you, and you can communicate with such characters normally. You can speak with animals when in this condition. Choose one type of animal commonly associated with lycanthropy (such as rats, wolves, or bears); you gain a +4 bonus on Handle Animal checks with these creatures.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.pg7dbmuuaksxhp3v]{Charm Animal} to your list of 1st-level oracle spells known and @Compendium[pf1.spells.0324zq42g3fu4kko]{Animal Messenger} to your list of 2nd-level oracle spells known.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.tjdfluulncmqacc3]{Beast Shape I} to your list of 3rd-level oracle spells known and @Compendium[pf1.spells.774kmgcb7ygviht0]{Beast Shape II} to your list of 5th-level oracle spells known.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you gain damage reduction 5/silver, and if you already have this type of damage reduction, it increases in value by 5 (to a maximum of DR 15/silver).</p>"
