    value: >-
      <p>This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and
      understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a
      racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one
      language at a time, although it may be able to understand several
      languages. <i>Tongues</i> does not enable the subject to speak with
      creatures who don't speak. The subject can make itself understood as far
      as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature
      addressed toward the subject in any way.</p><p><i>Tongues</i> can be made
      permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
