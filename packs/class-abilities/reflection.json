This functions as&nbsp;spell turning, but only if the targeted spell is of a level equal to or lower than the number of points expended. If insufficient points are expended, they instead grant an insight bonus on any saving throws allowed by the spell, equal to the number of points spent.</p>\n<p>The magus must be at least 15th level before selecting this magus arcana.</p>"
