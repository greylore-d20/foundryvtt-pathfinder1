  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane
      reservoir to create a 5-foot-radius vortex of chilling fog adjacent to
      him. Hints of leering, fiendish faces whirl within the mist. As a move
      action, the arcanist can direct the cloud of rift fog to move in any
      direction at a speed of 30 feet to a maximum range of 60 feet from the
      arcanist. The fog may ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target.
      Once the fog ends its movement, coils of its otherworldly mist surround
      any targets that are wholly or partially in its area. The fogâ€™s
      supernaturally cold temperature causes 1d6 points of cold damage to
      affected creatures. A creature damaged by rift fog becomes slowed (as per
      the @Compendium[pf1.spells.jcr72piqo6g549e1]{Slow} spell) for the
      following round if it fails a Will save. Once created, rift fog persists
      for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round), or until the
      arcanist activates a new exploit.</p>
