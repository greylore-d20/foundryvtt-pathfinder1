  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your hands and forearms are shriveled and blackened, as if you had
      plunged your arms into a blazing fire, and your thin, papery skin is
      sensitive to the touch. You take a –4 penalty on weapon attack rolls, but
      you add @Compendium[pf1.spells.lndeaqm2j2nvgm6p]{Burning Hands} to your
      list of spells known.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.q4ixxjb4v281g2xv]{Scorching
      Ray} and @Compendium[pf1.spells.lzos34s87qsc620l]{Flaming Sphere} to your
      list of spells known.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.92hth51cs9oi0nfe]{Wall Of
      Fire} to your list of spells known and your penalty on weapon attack rolls
      is reduced to –2.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.cm3l4h4mld9j8lar]{Delayed
      Blast Fireball} to your list of spells known.</p>
