      <p>This spell functions as <em>fireball</em> except you can cause the bead
      of fire to originate from anywhere you can see within range. You can
      choose a number of squares within the area up to your Intelligence bonus
      (for magi, occultists, or wizards) or Charisma bonus (for bloodragers or
      sorcerers) to be struck by weaker flames; the controlled <em>fireball</em>
      deals minimum damage in those squares. Attempts to identify controlled
      <em>fireball</em> with a skill check incorrectly identify it as
      <em>fireball</em> (see the ruse descriptor on page 192).</p>
