      <p>With a gesture, you muffle sound around the target, making it unable to
      yell or otherwise make loud noises. This does not affect spellcasting by
      the target. The target can still use sonic effects, but the DC of these
      effects decreases by 2. The target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws
      against sonic effects. The target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth
      checks.</p>
