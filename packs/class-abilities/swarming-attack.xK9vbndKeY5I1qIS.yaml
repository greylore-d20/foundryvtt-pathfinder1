  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Ratfolk ninjas use their large numbers to overwhelm their enemies with
      countless attacks. While using the swarming racial trait to share a space
      with an ally, a ninja with this talent gains a bonus on damage roles equal
      to the number of sneak attack dice her ally has. For example, a ninja
      would gain +3 damage if her ally has sneak attack 3d6.</p>
