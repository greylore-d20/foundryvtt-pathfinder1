  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A cruel weapon with blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an
      orc double axe is a double weapon. Though invented by and traditionally
      associated with orcs, the double axe can be crafted and wielded by other
      races as well, though many disdain it for its extreme weight and
      clumsiness. Because of the blades at either end of the axe, the wielder
      must hold an orc double axe in the middle of its haft, and utilize a
      weaving, slashing fighting style more akin to that of a quarterstaff than
      to that of a greataxe or battleaxe.</p>
