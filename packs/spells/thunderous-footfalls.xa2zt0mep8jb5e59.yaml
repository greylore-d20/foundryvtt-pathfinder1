    value: >-
      <p>This spell makes the target creature's footfalls shake the ground
      violently as he trundles, which may knock down smaller creatures as he
      passes by, though it also makes the target slower on land. The target's
      land speed is reduced by half (round down to the nearest 5-foot
      increment), but each time he moves overland adjacent to a creature that is
      at least one size category smaller than he is, that creature must succeed
      at a Fortitude saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
