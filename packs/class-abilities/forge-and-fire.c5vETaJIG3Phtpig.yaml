      <p>At 3rd level, you gain @Compendium[pf1.feats.4hNO4OAWYF5vXphH]{Craft
      Magic Arms and Armor} as a bonus feat. In addition, whenever you cast a
      nonpermanent, noninstantaneous spell that improves or enhances a
      manufactured weapon, you can also give that weapon the <em>flaming</em>
      special ability for the spellâ€™s duration (This has no effect if the weapon
      already has the <em>flaming</em> special ability).</p>
