      - Vigilante
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante can take a move action to gain the benefit of a feat with
      a racial prerequisite he meets but doesn’t have. This effect lasts for 1
      minute. The vigilante must meet all the feat’s prerequisites. He can use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 his vigilante
      level (minimum four times per day). The vigilante can use this ability
      again before the duration expires to replace a previous racial feat with
      another choice.<p>If a feat temporarily gained in this way has a daily use
      limitation, any uses of that feat while using this ability count toward
      that feat’s daily limit.<p>This vigilante talent can be selected multiple
      times. Each time it is selected after the first, the vigilante can use
      this ability to gain the benefits of one additional racial feat at the
      same time, or to reduce the action required to activate this talent by one
      step (a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free
      action, and a free action becomes an immediate action). If the vigilante
      chooses to gain the benefits of multiple feats, the feats selected must
      share the same racial prerequisite. He can use one of these feats to meet
      a prerequisite of a second feat; doing so means he cannot replace a feat
      currently fulfilling another’s prerequisite without also replacing those
      feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward his
      daily uses of this ability.</p>
