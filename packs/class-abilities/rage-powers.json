      "value": "<p>As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">rage power</a>. She gains another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">rage power</a>&nbsp;for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">rage powers</a>&nbsp;only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>\n<p>Any barbarian who meets the powers’ prerequisites can select and use rage powers. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with “dragon totem” in its title).</p>"
