    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions identically to the spell <i>zone of truth</i>,
      except as noted above. The target momentarily takes on the semblance of a
      being of perfect order, like an archon or inevitable, so that all who can
      see the target know it is affected by the spell. This divine guise
      flickers over the target for only an instant and does not allow it to pass
      as a member of a different race.</p>
