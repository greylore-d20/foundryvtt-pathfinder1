  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You grant the creature touched the ability to breathe with ease air
      that is contaminated with ash, spores, smoke, dust, or the like. The
      creature suffers no ill effects from natural airborne irritants or
      contaminants and gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against magical effects
      that involve any of these contaminants. In addition, the creature can see
      through magical obscuring effects caused by dense ash, smoke, fog, or
      similar concealment up to a distance of 60 feet, although this spell does
      nothing to enhance sight in dark or shadowy conditions. You can cast this
      spell on multiple creatures, but if you do, divide the duration evenly
      among all the creatures you touch (to a minimum duration of 10 minutes per
      target).</p>
