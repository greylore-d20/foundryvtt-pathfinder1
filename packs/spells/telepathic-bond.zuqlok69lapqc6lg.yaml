  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing
      creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher.
      Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The
      creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of
      language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the
      bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not
      from one plane to another).</p><p>If desired, you may leave yourself out
      of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of
      casting.</p><p><i>Telepathic bond</i> can be made permanent with a
      <i>permanency</i> spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of
      <i>permanency</i>.</p>
