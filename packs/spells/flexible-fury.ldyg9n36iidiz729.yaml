    value: >-
      <p>You swap one of your current rage powers for another rage power you
      qualify for. If the rage power granted by this spell has a use limitation
      (such as once per rage or a number of times per day), any uses of that
      rage power count toward that limit (including for later castings of this
      spell).</p><p>If you swap out a rage power that is required to qualify for
      another one of your rage powers, you cannot use any rage powers dependent
      on the one you swapped out until the spell ends. For example, if you have
      the intimidating glare and terrifying howl rage powers and you swap out
      intimidating glare for surprise accuracy, you cannot use terrifying howl
      until the spell ends.</p>
