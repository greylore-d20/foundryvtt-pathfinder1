      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This tool lets you dig a pit at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. If a
      shovel is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that
      deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.<p>Folding
      Shovel: A folding shovel is a full-sized shovel with a sturdy sectional
      handle that folds into pieces no longer than the shovel blade, allowing it
      to fit in a smaller space such as a backpack. Converting the shovel from
      its folded state to usable (or vice versa) is 2 full-round actions.</p>
