      <p>You scramble the synaptic connections of your target, causing it to
      lose the ability to coherently communicate and to take unintended actions
      when it meant to perform others. The target cannot effectively communicate
      while under the spell's influence, and thus cannot engage in acts like
      speaking, attempting Bluff checks to pass secret messages, writing, or
      using telepathy, although the spell doesn't prevent verbalizations made
      for purposes other than communication, such as command words or the verbal
      component of spellcasting.  The target's mind is too scrambled to take
      full-round actions or longer actions, as the target's attention inevitably
      wanders before the action completes. Whenever the target attempts to take
      a move action or a standard action, roll on the following table instead.
      If the result on the table is an action that the target cannot take, the
      target takes no action instead. </p><table
      border="1"><tbody><tr><th>d%</th><th>Action</th></tr><tr><td>1-20</td><td>Move
      action (must use move action to move)</td></tr><tr><td>21-40</td><td>Other
      move action (perform a move action other than
      moving)</td></tr><tr><td>41-60</td><td>Attack action (spend a standard
      action on the attack action, attacking once with a
      weapon)</td></tr><tr><td>61-80</td><td>Other standard action (perform a
      standard action that isn't the attack
      action)</td></tr><tr><td>81-100</td><td>Desired action (perform whatever
      standard or move action the creature desires to
      perform)</td></tr></tbody></table>
