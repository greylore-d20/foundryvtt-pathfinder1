    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent can spend a swift action to attempt to make an
      opponent act like an ally for purposes of providing a flank until the
      beginning of the rogue’s next turn. The opponent must be able to hear and
      see the rogue, and the rogue must succeed at a Bluff check opposed by the
      opponent’s Sense Motive. If the check succeeds, the opponent acts as an
      ally for the purpose of providing a flank. Whether or not the check
      succeeds, the rogue cannot use this trick again on the same opponent for
      the next 24 hours. If the rogue fails the check by 5 or more, she cannot
      use the unwitting ally ability on any opponent within line of sight of the
      failed attempt for 24 hours.</p>
