  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Levitate</i> allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an
      object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be
      levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing
      creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much
      as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action.</p><p>You cannot move
      the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face
      of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally
      (generally at half its base land speed).</p><p>A levitating creature that
      attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable;
      the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so
      on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the
      creature to begin again at -1.</p>
