      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, when the cavalier deals damage to an opponent with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/HellknightOrders.aspx\">Hellknight order’s favored weapon</a>, as a swift action he learns whether that creature’s alignment is chaotic, as if he had cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.17eskras8cjynj10]{Detect Chaos}&nbsp;and studied the creature for 3 rounds. Additionally, if he learns that a creature is chaotic by using this ability, he gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against it. This bonus does not stack with itself, but it does stack with the bonus from the cavalier’s challenge.</p>"
