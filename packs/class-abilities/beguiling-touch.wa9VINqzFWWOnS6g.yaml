    value: >-
      <p>You can charm a living creature by touching it. Creatures with more
      <em>Hit Dice</em> than your wizard level are unaffected, as are creatures
      in combat and those with an attitude of hostile toward you. Creatures
      receive a <em>Will</em> <em>saving throw</em> to negate the effect. The DC
      of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your
      <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. Creatures that fail their save are
      affected by @Compendium[pf1.spells.smbkd2yobhshbpqf]{Charm Monster} for a
      number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). This is a
      mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day
      equal to 3 + your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>
