      <p>You call upon the wild winds of the Abyssal atmosphere, howling with
      the screams of damned and demented souls in torment. The area is filled
      with winds of windstorm strength (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 439), blowing in a
      random direction each round. Creatures within the area of effect are
      deafened as long as they remain within the area and for 1d4 rounds
      thereafter; however, they continue to hear the sounds of screams in their
      minds with painful intensity, causing them to become shaken for as long as
      they remain deafened. A successful Will save negates the shaken condition
      but not the deafness.</p>
