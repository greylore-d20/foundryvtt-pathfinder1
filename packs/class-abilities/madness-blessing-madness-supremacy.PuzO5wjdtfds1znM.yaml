  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, as a swift action you can target a creature within 30
      feet that has the cowering, frightened, panicked, or paralyzed condition.
      That condition is suspended for 1 round, and the chosen creature gains the
      confused condition instead. The confused creature rerolls any result other
      than “attack self ” or “attack nearest creature.” The round spent confused
      counts toward the duration of the suspended effect. At the end of the
      confused round, the suspended condition resumes.</p>
