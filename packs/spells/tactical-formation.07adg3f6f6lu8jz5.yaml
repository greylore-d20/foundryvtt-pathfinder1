    <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> In order to prepare this spell, the caster must
    spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches <b>Torag</b>.
    Further details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of
    Golarion.</em></p><p>This spell increases the effectiveness of a group's
    formation in battle. When cast, all creatures under the effect of the spell
    must be adjacent to one another, forming an unbroken chain of squares (which
    may include creatures sharing the same square). This chain does not need to
    be a straight line. Each target in the chain receives a +2 defection bonus
    to AC as long as the targets stay adjacent to at least one other creature
    affected by the spell; moving more than 5 feet from another target ends the
    spell with respect to that creature only. For example, a cleric could cast
    it on himself and four dwarves blocking a 20-foot-wide corridor; the cleric
    can move freely from the left side of the formation to the right side
    (whether in front of or behind the other targets) and not break the spell as
    long as he stays within 5 feet of at least one of them.</p>
