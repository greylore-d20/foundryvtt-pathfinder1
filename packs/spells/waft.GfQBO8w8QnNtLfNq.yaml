      <p>You make the targets light enough to be carried by wind. Creatures
      affected by this spell suffer cumulative penalties for attacking as if
      under the effects of @Compendium[pf1.spells.plou8h168bfn5hq6]{levitate}
      unless they have a fly speed. Treat each target as two size categories
      lighter for the purposes of being checked or blown away by wind. If a
      target has a fly speed, it can fly overland at the windâ€™s speed in the
      same direction as the wind by succeeding at a DC 20
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.iH69GIwm8BjecrPN]{Fly}
      check. If a creature flying overland this way attempts to change
      direction, it risks being blown away as usual. By linking hands or
      creating a connection with rope, creatures affected by this spell can be
      towed through the air by a flying creature as if each weighed only
      one-eighth its actual weight.</p>
