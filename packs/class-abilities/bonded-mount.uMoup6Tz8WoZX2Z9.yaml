  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal
      mount. The creature must be one that you are capable of riding and is
      suitable as a mount. A Medium oracle can select a camel or a horse. A
      Small oracle can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a
      dog if she is at least 4th level. This mount functions as a druid's animal
      companion, using your oracle level as your effective druid level. Bonded
      mounts have an Intelligence score of at least 6.</p>
