      "value": "<p>The witch can use her cauldron to brew a foul toxin in which she can steep fruits and other delicious edibles, transforming them so that when eaten, they have the same effect as a @Compendium[pf1.spells.vdh0yuzpjwhky6kr]{Poison} spell. Brewing the toxin and then steeping the food takes 1 hour in total; steeping can affect up to 1 pound of food. The food is poisoned for 24 hours, and the poison cannot be transferred to other objects. The food tastes normal, but magic detects it as poisonous.</p>\n<p>The witch must have the cauldron hex to select this hex.</p>"
