    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent takes only a –2 penalty on Ride checks when
      riding a mount bareback instead of the normal –5 penalty. When using the
      Ride skill to make a mount leap, a character with this talent can use her Ride
      modifier or her mount’s jump modifier, whichever is higher, instead of
      using the lower of the two. A character with this talent gains a +5 competence
      bonus when using the Ride skill to soften a fall from her mount or to
      perform a fast mount or dismount. Finally, a character with this talent can
      attempt a DC 15 Ride check to recover from a position of cover as a free
      action instead of as a move action. Failing this check results in the
      recovery requiring a move action as normal. A character must be trained in
      Ride to select this talent.</p>
