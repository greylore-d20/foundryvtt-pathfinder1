  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you can rally your allies within 30 feet, allowing each
      to immediately do one of the following as a free action that does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity: remove the flat-footed condition, take a
      5-foot step, draw a weapon, ready a shield, or gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC
      for 1 round. You can affect a number of allies equal to your Wisdom bonus.
      These actions do not count against your alliesâ€™ total movement or actions
      on their next turn.</p>
