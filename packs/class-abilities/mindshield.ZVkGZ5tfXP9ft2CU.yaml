    value: >-
      <p>The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give one target
      of the linked spell a +2 morale bonus on Will saves for 1 round per
      psychic level (maximum 10 rounds).</p>

      <p>The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If
      the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the
      same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect
      with this amplification.</p>

      <p>She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points
      for each creature; she canâ€™t grant different bonuses to different
      targets.</p>
