    value: >-
      <p>You transform one or more improvised weapons into equivalent simple or
      martial weapons. The bearer of such a weapon can wield it with proficiency
      (no penalty for using an improvised weapon or not having the required
      proficiency). This does not alter the weapon's shape or appearance in any
      way. For example, if cast on a chair leg, butter knife, and pitchfork, the
      weapons function as a club, dagger, and trident, respectively, and anyone
      who wields them does so without a nonproficiency penalty, but the weapons
      look no different than they were before the spell.  The spell has no
      effect on items that are not improvised weapons. For example, if cast on a
      short sword, it does not grant proficiency to anyone wielding it.</p>
