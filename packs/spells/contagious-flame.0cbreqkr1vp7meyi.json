    "shortDescription": "<p>You blast several enemies with beams of fire. You may fire three rays, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of five rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.</p><p>The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.</p><p>Every round on your turn, a new ray of fire launches from each creature who took damage from the spell in the previous round-these new rays attack as if you fired them, but their point of origin is the previous creature damaged. You can choose the new targets as a free action, all of whom must be within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of their new starting point. This contagion of flame continues for a total of three rounds-a creature can be struck more than once by this spell over the course of these three rounds, although never by a ray of fire that launches from itself.</p>"
