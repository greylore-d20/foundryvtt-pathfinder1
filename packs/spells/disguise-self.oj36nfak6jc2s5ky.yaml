  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You make yourself--including clothing, armor, weapons, and
      equipmen--look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin,
      fat, or in between. You cannot change your creature type (although you can
      appear as another subtype). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change
      is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an
      entirely different person or gender.</p><p>The spell does not provide the
      abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the
      perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your
      equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus
      on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a
      Will save to recognize it as an illusion.</p>
