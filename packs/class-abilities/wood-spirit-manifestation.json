      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a living creature of wood. She is forevermore treated as a plant creature rather than her original creature type for the purposes of spells and magical effects. Her skin takes on the appearance of polished wood grain, and she gains a +4 natural armor bonus to her Armor Class and damage reduction 10/â€” against wooden weapons and the natural attacks of wooden and wood-like creatures. She gains immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun.</p>\n<p>At will, the shaman can meld with any tree or single block of wood (as per meld into stone, except she can meld only with wood and has no limit on how long she can remain in the wood).</p>"
