      "value": "<p>The alchemist is able to concoct reactive chemical compounds that affect elementals like poisons. The alchemist can craft poisons that affect only outsiders with the elemental subtype, bypassing their inherent immunity. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its saving throw, the poison acts as normal, but it may have no effect on the creature depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing fire damage to a fire elemental).</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
