  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the cavalier can spend a standard action to grant one of
      a number of bonuses to all allies within 30 feet (including himself). The
      allies must be able to see or hear the cavalier to receive this bonus. The
      cavalier can grant a +2 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round, a +2 morale bonus
      on all attack rolls for 1 round, or the ability to move up to their speed
      as an immediate action once. The cavalier can grant a different bonus to
      each ally within range, but allies can only benefit from this ability once
      per combat.</p>
