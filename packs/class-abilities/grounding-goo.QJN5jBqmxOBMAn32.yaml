    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist’s bomb applies a sticky residue after any damage from the
      bomb is resolved. If a creature damaged by the bomb has a nonmagical fly
      speed, its flight is severely impaired, and it takes a penalty equal to
      the alchemist’s level on Fly checks for 1 minute.</p>
