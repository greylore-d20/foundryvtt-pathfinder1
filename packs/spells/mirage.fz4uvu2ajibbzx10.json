The image is purely visual, and structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.</p><p>Anyone interacting with the illusion can attempt to disbelieve it, and a creature trained in Survival can make a special attempt to disbelieve the illusion. The creature must be within 120 feet of the illusion's area and can attempt a Survival check instead of a Will saving throw. If the result is equal to or greater than the spell's save DC, the creature realizes the mirage is an illusion as if it disbelieved the spell.</p>"
