  shortDescription: >-
    <p><i>Ghost sound</i> allows you to create a volume of sound that rises,
    recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of
    sound <i>ghost sound</i> creates when casting it and cannot thereafter
    change the sound's basic character.</p><p>The volume of sound created
    depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans
    per caster level (maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting,
    walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a <i>ghost
    sound</i> spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the
    volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume
    as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise
    from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans.
    Anyone who hears a <i>ghost sound</i> receives a Will save to
    disbelieve.</p><p><i>Ghost sound</i> can enhance the effectiveness of a
    <i>silent image</i> spell.</p><p><i>Ghost sound</i> can be made permanent
    with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
