    value: >-
      <p>When a rogue with this talent uses dimension door as a spell or
      spell-like ability, including the abundant step or shadow jump class
      feature, then all creatures adjacent to the rogue at the start and end of
      her teleportation are entangled by grasping shadows for 1 round (although
      the creatures are not anchored in place). A successful Reflex saving throw
      negates this effect. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
      rogue’s level + the rogue’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever
      is higher). The rogue must have dimension door as a spell or spell-like
      ability (including the abundant step or shadow jump class feature) before
      choosing this talent.</p>
