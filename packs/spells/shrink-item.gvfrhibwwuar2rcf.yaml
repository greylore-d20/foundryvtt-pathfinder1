      <p>You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size
      limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the
      original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's
      size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken
      composition to a clothlike one.</p><p>Objects changed by a <i>shrink
      item</i> spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by
      tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the
      original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this
      spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition
      ends the spell.</p><p><i>Shrink item</i> can be made permanent with a
      <i>permanency</i> spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk
      and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original
      caster.</p>
