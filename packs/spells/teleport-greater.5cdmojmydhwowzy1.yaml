      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.ptqu8gtrujxsvwy1]{teleport}<em>,</em>
      except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off
      target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that
      case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which
      you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient
      information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply
      reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not
      possible.</p>
