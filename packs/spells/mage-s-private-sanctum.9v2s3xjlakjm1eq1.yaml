  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside
      sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds,
      no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from
      outside. Those inside can see out normally.</p><p>Divination (scrying)
      spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are
      immune to <i>detect thoughts</i>. The ward prevents speech between those
      inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not
      prevent other communication, such as a <i>sending</i> or <i>message</i>
      spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her
      familiar.</p><p>The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from
      moving into and out of the area.</p><p>Mage's private sanctum can be made
      permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
