  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the character throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the
      cloud must make a Fortitude save or be blinded by the black smoke for 1d4
      rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character’s
      class level + the characters’s Charisma modifier. This trick cannot be
      combined with a choking bomb, but the character can combine a blinding
      bomb with a poison bomb. The character must have the choking bomb ninja
      trick before selecting this trick/talent.</p>
