  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A boarding gaff, or gaff hook, is a long pole with a hook for spearing
      fish. Pirates often add extra, heavier hooks to both ends of boarding
      gaffs to assist with boarding actions, giving the weapon its common name.
      A boarding gaff can also be used for fishing.</p>
