      <p>This spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.i3w7iwvxrvit0iez]{Illusion of Treachery} except
      that it also conceals your own actions (as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.nju9j6zlv9sbiznw]{Illusion of Calm}) and renders
      invisible all spell effects and ranged attacks originating from you until
      they reach the attack's target (this doesn't cause the attack's target to
      be unable to avoid the attack, as they still see the attack originating
      from the spell's target).</p>
