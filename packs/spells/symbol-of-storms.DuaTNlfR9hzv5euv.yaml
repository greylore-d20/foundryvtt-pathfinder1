      <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol
      of death}, except that when triggered, a 30-foot-radius centered on the
      symbol fills with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). Each round, a bolt of
      lightning that deals 10d6 points of electricity damage strikes a random
      creature within the area. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
      Unlike <em>symbol of death</em>, <em>symbol of storms</em> has no hit
      point limit. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a
      creature more than 30 feet from a symbol of storms canâ€™t trigger it (even
      if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the
      rune). Once triggered, a symbol of storms remains active for 1 minute per
      caster level.</p>
