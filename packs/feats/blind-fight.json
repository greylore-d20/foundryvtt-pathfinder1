      "value": "<p><em>You are skilled at attacking opponents that you cannot clearly perceive.</em><br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />In melee, every time you miss because of concealment (see Combat), you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit.<br /><br />An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.<br /><br />You do not need to make Acrobatics skill checks to move at full speed while blinded.<br /><br /><strong>Normal</strong><br />Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong><br />The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell.<br /><br /><strong>Combat Trick</strong><br />Once per round, when you hit a creature that benefits from concealment, you can spend 2 stamina points to ignore the miss chance from that creature's concealment until the end of your next turn.</p>"
