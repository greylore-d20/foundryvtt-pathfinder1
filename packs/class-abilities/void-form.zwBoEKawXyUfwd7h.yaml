    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you can become semi-tangible as a standard action. While
      in this form, you are immune to critical hits and gain a +1 def lection
      bonus to AC. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels
      thereafter. You can use this power a number of rounds per day equal to
      your cleric level. These rounds need not be consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Remote Viewing power of the Knowledge
      Domain.</p>
