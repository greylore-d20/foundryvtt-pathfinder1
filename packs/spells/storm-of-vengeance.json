    "shortDescription": "<p>You create a huge black storm cloud in the air. Each creature under the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 x 10 minutes. Each round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your turn.</p><p><i>2nd Round</i>: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage (no save).</p><p><i>3rd Round</i>: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud.</p><p>You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed at the same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. A creature struck can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.</p><p><i>4th Round</i>: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save).</p><p><i>5th through 10th Rounds</i>: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters.</p><p>Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the <i>storm of</i> vengeance's save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.</p>",
