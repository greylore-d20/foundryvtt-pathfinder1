      <p>This spell functions like <i>phantasmal killer</i>, except it can
      affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the
      phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as
      shadowy shapes.</p><p>If a subject's Fortitude save succeeds, it still
      takes 3d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. The subject also
      takes 1d4 points of Strength damage.</p>
