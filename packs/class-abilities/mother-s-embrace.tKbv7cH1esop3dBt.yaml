  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The hagâ€™s call grows stronger as you grow more desperate, promising
      protection and release if only you would succumb. When you would fail a
      Will save, you can add 1d4 to your result; whether or not this causes you
      to succeed at the saving throw, you take 2 points of Wisdom damage.</p>

      <p>When you perform an act of cruelty, you regain 1 phrenic pool point.
      You can use each aspect of this ability a number of times per day equal to
      your Charisma modifier.</p>
