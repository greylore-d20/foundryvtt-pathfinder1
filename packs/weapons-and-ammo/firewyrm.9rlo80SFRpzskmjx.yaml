      <strong>Proficiency</strong> Siege Engine</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This
      siege engine is a larger version of the firedrake. A firewyrm is too large
      to be transported to the battlefield in one piece and must be assembled
      once the component parts reach the battlefield. A firewyrm fires its gout
      of flame in either a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone (crew leader's
      choice). Targets in the area take 6d6 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex
      save halves). Those who fail their saves catch on fire.</p><p>A firewyrm
      with the broken condition that suffers a further mishap explodes, dealing
      its damage to all creatures within a 30-foot blast (DC 20 Reflex save
      halves).</p><p>One use of firewyrm ammunition costs 400 gp and weighs 40
      pounds.</p>
