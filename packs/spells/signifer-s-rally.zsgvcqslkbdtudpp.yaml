    value: >-
      <p>You <i>teleport</i> up to one ally per five caster levels to your
      location.</p><p>You determine which allies you want to <i>teleport</i> at
      the time of casting; these allies have 1 round to decide to allow or
      refuse your spell, and they <i>teleport</i> immediately upon accepting.
      Allies are <i>teleport</i>ed as if you had cast <i>teleport</i> on them
      (your current location is at least "studied carefully" for this purpose),
      appearing in a puff of brimstone in a space adjacent to you. If you are in
      combat and your allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon
      arrival but are not considered flat-footed even though they have not taken
      any actions. The spell does not function in areas warded against intrusion
      by evil creatures (such as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect).</p>
