      <p>An oread adventurer discovered these small green gemstones when, after
      suffering a wound from falling on some jagged stones while exploring a
      cavern, she noticed pieces of beautiful green crystal growing from her
      skin. Oread jewelers found that these crystals, dubbed fleshgems, seemed
      to feed on the elemental energy that permeates an oread's flesh, growing
      from tiny chips of stone into large, elaborate gemstones. Essentially
      harmless, implanting fleshgems became a unique racial method of body
      alteration among oreads, equivalent to tattoos and piercings among other
      <em>humanoids</em>. Decorative fleshgems cost 1 gp and are merely
      ornamental. Fleshgem spikes, on the other hand, grow into elaborate
      crystalline shards that function as armor spikes, but the oread wearing
      them cannot wear armor over the spikes and even normal clothing requires
      special holes or seams to allow the spikes to stick out. Implanting a set
      of fleshgem spikes takes 10 minutes, and the resulting shard takes about a
      week to grow to full size. Removing a fleshgem takes 1 minute; the person
      removing the gem must make a successful DC 15 <em>Heal</em> check to avoid
      dealing 1d4 points of damage to the oread. The fleshgem spikes can be
      <em>sundered</em> or destroyed as if the growths were a worn object
      (<em>hardness</em> 1, 5 hp), but unless the embedded root of the fleshgem
      is removed, the shards grow back 1 week later.</p>
