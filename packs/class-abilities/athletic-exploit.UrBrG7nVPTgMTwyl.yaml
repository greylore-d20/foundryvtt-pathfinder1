  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you gain the ability to overcome physical obstacles
      with ease. Until the beginning of your next turn, you halve your armor
      check penalty when attempting Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, and Swim
      skill checks, and you gain a bonus equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum
      +1) on such skill checks.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Strength Surge power of the Strength
      Domain.</p>
