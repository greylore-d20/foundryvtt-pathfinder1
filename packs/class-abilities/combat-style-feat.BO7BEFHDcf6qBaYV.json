He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>\n<p>The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>"
