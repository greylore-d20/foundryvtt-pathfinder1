  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An arrow of acid springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You
      must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The arrow deals
      2d4 points of acid damage with no splash damage. For every three caster
      levels you possess, the acid, unless neutralized, lasts for another round
      (to a maximum of 6 additional rounds at 18th level), dealing another 2d4
      points of damage in each round.</p>
