  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon is infused with magic, allowing it to treat all of its
      natural attacks as if they were magic for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction.</p>

      <p>If the summoner is 10th level or higher, all of the eidolon's weapons
      are treated as the alignment of the eidolon for the purpose of overcoming
      damage reduction.</p>
