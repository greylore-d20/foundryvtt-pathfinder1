  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a supernaturally vicious and clever crow to watch over you
      on the battlefield. Choose one of the following templates; the crow has
      that template and this spell gains the descriptor listed in parentheses:
      celestial (good), entropicB2 (chaotic), fiendish (evil), or resoluteB2
      (lawful). In addition to its normal abilities, the crow gains the Improved
      Steal feat  as a bonus feat and gains an eye rake attack. If both of its
      claw attacks hit the same living foe in a single round, that foe must
      succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be blinded as the bird scratches and
      tears at the foe's eyes. The blindness lasts for 1d4 days or until healed
      with <i>remove blindness</i>.  If the focus leaves your possession, the
      crow vanishes and the spell ends.</p>
