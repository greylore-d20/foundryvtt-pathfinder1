      "value": "<p>At 13th level, the vampire hunter can prevent a creature killed by a vampire from returning to life as a vampire itself. By spending 10 minutes and dousing a body with a <em>vial</em> of <em>holy water</em>, the vampire hunter removes the infection of vampirism from a creature slain by a vampire’s <em>blood drain</em> or <em>energy drain</em> ability, preventing it from rising as a <em>vampire spawn</em> via a vampire’s create spawn ability. This effect cannot be undone with any magic weaker than a @Compendium[pf1.spells.suel7sgnztenv551]{Miracle} or @Compendium[pf1.spells.nnj51dwfkwd15ngj]{Wish}. If the corpse is returned to life and subsequently killed by a vampire again might it become a <em>vampire spawn</em>.</p>"
