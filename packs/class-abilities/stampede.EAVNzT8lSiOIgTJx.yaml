  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, as a standard action, the cavalier can incite any
      riderless and nonhostile animals and animal companions within 60 feet of
      him to stampede. Each affected creature gains a +4 bonus to AC (this bonus
      stacks with the benefits of the cavalier’s challenge), the trample
      universal monster rule, and a bonus to damage equal to half the cavalier’s
      level for 1 round. The save DC against an incited animal’s trample attack
      is 10 + half the cavalier’s level + his Charisma modifier. Incited
      creatures attack whatever targets the cavalier directs them to unless
      commanded otherwise by a bonded master (in the case of a familiar or
      animal companion).</p>
