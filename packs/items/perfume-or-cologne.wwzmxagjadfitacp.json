More expensive scents are available in finer quarters of any city. Exotic scents are sold in vials containing 10 applications, with a single dose lasting for 24 hours during which its wearer gains a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on all <em>Diplomacy</em> checks (save for those against creatures who, at the GM's discretion, would not be swayed by <em>scent</em>).</p>"
