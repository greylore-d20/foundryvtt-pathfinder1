  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, as standard action, you can call a brief shower of rain
      in a 30-foot radius. Creatures in the area are healed of an amount of
      nonlethal damage equal to double your cleric level and are no longer
      exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, or sickened. You can use this ability once
      per day at 8th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels
      beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Lightning Lord power of the Weather Domain.</p>
