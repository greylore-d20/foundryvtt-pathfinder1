  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As part of the full-round action to perform a charge attack against a
      creature at least 20 feet away, the barbarian can move 5 feet in any
      direction before making the charge. This movement is not a 5-foot step and
      provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and using this option reduces
      the maximum distance of the charge by 10 feet.</p>
