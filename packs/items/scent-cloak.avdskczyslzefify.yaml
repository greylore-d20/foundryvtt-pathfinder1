      <p>This collection of coarsely ground spices, seeds, and alchemical
      reagents overrides your scent, increasing the DC of tracking you by scent
      by +10 for 24 hours. Because you still have a smell, creatures with
      <em>scent</em> can still detect and pinpoint if you are cloaked; they just
      can't identify your smell as something unique. Washing for 1 full round
      removes the scent cloak.</p>
