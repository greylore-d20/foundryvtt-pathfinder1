      <b>Speed</b> 15 ft.</p><p><b>Category</b> Close Assault;
      <b>Proficiency</b> Siege Engine</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The most basic
      close assault weapons are iron-shod logs carried by one or more creatures
      to combine their strength. A ram can be used to deal damage or to make a
      Strength check against the target's break DC.</p><p><em>Ramming
      Charge</em>: Rams require momentum to be effective. All creatures using
      the ram must use the charge action to gain its full effect. Creatures not
      wishing to charge may make a ram attack as a full-round action, taking a
      -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls and Strength checks with the
      ram.</p><p><em>Breaking</em>: The crew leader makes a Strength check with
      a +2 bonus, adding +2 for each member of the crew (or equivalent number of
      larger creatures; see Crew under Siege Engine Rules) assisting. The ram
      also provides a +4 bonus per size category above
      Medium.</p><p><em>Damage</em>: The crew leader makes an attack roll with a
      -4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals the listed damage, plus the
      Strength modifiers of the crew leader and all members of the crew,
      regardless of their size.</p><p><em>Improvised Ram</em>: Any tree, log, or
      timber can be used as a ram with a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls
      and Strength checks.</p><p><em>Pick</em>: A ram with a pick head grants a
      +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and attack and damage rolls made
      against stone structures.</p><p><em>Screw</em>: A ram with a screw head
      grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and attack and damage
      rolls made against earthen structures.</p><p><em>Gallery Ram</em>: This is
      a ram suspended from chains or ropes within a gallery. A gallery ram does
      not require a charge action for full momentum. In addition, adding tethers
      to the back end of the ram allows four additional crew members to assist
      in using the ram.</p><p><em>Hit Points</em>: Rams have a hardness of 5 and
      hit points based on their size. A Colossal one has 625 hit points.
      Improvised rams have half the normal hit points.</p>
