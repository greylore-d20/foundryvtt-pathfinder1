  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target sees its own attire as hopelessly out of fashion,
    ostentatious, and embarrassing, and is filled with a compulsion  to strip
    off all clothing. Each round, the target must spend a move action to remove
    a worn item that can be removed with a move action, dropping the item once
    it is removed. The target doesn't distinguish between magical and nonmagical
    items when removing them. Each round it removes an item as determined
    randomly from the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands,
    head, headband, shoulders, or wrists. When determining randomly, don't
    include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don't
    include items that take more than one move action to remove. Though
    creatures can't have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they
    can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly
    decide which one they remove. If a target is wearing clothing that doesn't
    fit in any of those slots, such as breeches or a quiver, add it to the list
    of possibilities at the GM's discretion.  The target regards the discarded
    items with revulsion, and if forced to touch such an item (such as with a
    melee or ranged touch attack using the item as an improvised weapon), the
    target becomes sickened for 1d3 rounds. Other than the move action to remove
    items, the character can take whatever actions it chooses.</p>
