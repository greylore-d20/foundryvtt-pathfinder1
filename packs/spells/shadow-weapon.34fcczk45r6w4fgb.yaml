    value: >-
      <p>Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you shape a quasi-real masterwork
      melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to
      make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a
      weapon of its type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it
      may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage
      normally, success means it only takes 1 point of damage from the weapon's
      attacks. The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects.  If an
      attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check
      (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the
      <i>shadow weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted,
      the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as
      normal.  At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At
      10th-level, you may increase the enhancement bonus to +2 or add the
      <i>frost</i> or <i>keen</i> weapon property. The <i>frost</i> and
      <i>keen</i> properties have no effect if the target makes its disbelief
      save.  The spell ends if the weapon leaves your possession.</p>
