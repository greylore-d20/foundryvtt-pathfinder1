  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Made from hardened leather reinforced with a band of metal, this collar
      protects the wearer against <em>vampire</em> bites when worn around the
      throat. It provides a +1 <em>armor bonus</em> to AC against
      <em>vampire</em> bites or similar attacks that specifically target the
      wearer's throat. Unlike most armor bonuses, the neck guard's +1 bonus
      stacks with the <em>armor bonus</em> of light or medium <em>armor</em>,
      but it provides no additional bonus when worn with heavy armor.</p>
