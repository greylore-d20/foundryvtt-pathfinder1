  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a move action, you can tear open a small rent in reality just large
      enough to reach an arm through. The far end of this portal must be within
      10 feet of you, but otherwise allows you to manipulate objects, perform
      melee attacks requiring a single hand, or even cast spells. If you cannot
      see your target, standard concealment penalties apply. You cannot move
      either end of the portal once itâ€™s created, and the opening collapses
      immediately when you leave your current space or withdraw your arm, but it
      otherwise lasts for 1 round per psychic level. Your disembodied hand uses
      your AC with a +4 size bonus, should opponents target it. This size bonus
      does not apply to disarm combat maneuver checks.<p>You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, the range of your rift reach increases to 20 feet.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, your range increases to 30 feet.</p>
