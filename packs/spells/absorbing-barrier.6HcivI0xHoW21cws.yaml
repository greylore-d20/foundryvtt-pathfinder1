  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You ward all creatures and objects in the area from ranged weapons. The
    spell's area of effect is often a sphere, although you can shape it to be
    smaller than the maximum area or to exclude certain adjacent areas or
    objects (for example, if you are warding a specific structure, or if you are
    roughly warding the front lines of a battlefield). This spell's area is also
    up to 40 feet in height, so flying creatures benefit as long as they are in
    this area of effect.<p>Creatures and objects in the warded area gain damage
    reduction 20/magic against ranged weapons. Once the spell has prevented a
    total of 20 points of damage per caster level (maximum 200 points) to
    creatures and objects in the area, it is discharged.</p>
