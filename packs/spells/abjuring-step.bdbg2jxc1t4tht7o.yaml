  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates a subtle and complicated force effect that is most
      effective when used by a still or slow-moving spellcaster or formula user.
      While you are subject to this spell, you can take two 5-foot steps each
      round and still cast spells and use spell-like abilities without provoke
      attacks of opportunity. This spell automatically discharges as soon as you
      make an attack, cast a harmful spell against another creature, or move
      more than 5 feet with a single move action. If the action that discharges
      the spell also provokes attacks of opportunity, that action still provokes
      attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>
