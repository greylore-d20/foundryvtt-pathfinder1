      <p>A whip of cracking magical might appears in your hand, allowing you
      lash spells from the mind of enemy spellcasters. With a lash of
      bluish-purple energy, you strip many protective spells and effects from a
      single creature. If the target of this spell is currently under the
      effects of any harmless spells or effects, it must succeed at a Will save
      or all of those spells and effects end, stripping the target of the
      benefit of those spells. If the target is not currently under the effect
      of least one harmless spell, the target is instead confused for 1d4
      rounds.</p>
