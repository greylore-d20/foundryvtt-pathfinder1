  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a <i>+1 longsword</i> of pure force sized appropriately for
      you that you can wield or give to another creature like any other
      longsword. At 8th level, the sword functions as a <i>+2 longsword</i>. At
      13th level, it functions as a <i>+3 longsword</i>. A <i>force sword</i>
      cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>,
      <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of
      cancellation</i> affects it.  If a creature you attack with the sword has
      spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your
      caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>force
      sword</i> strikes it. If you fail the check, the spell is dispelled. If
      you succeed, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for
      the duration of the spell.</p>
