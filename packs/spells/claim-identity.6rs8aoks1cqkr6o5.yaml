      <p>You steal the target's face, transforming yourself into a flawless
      imitation of it. All of the target's facial features, vocal cues, and
      identifying physical traits change, transforming it into an unremarkable
      member of its race and gender. You transform into a perfect likeness of
      the target's true form, as if affected by <i>alter self</i>, and gain a
      +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the original subject of this
      spell; you take no penalties on this check if the original target is of a
      different race, age, size, or gender. <i>Claim identity</i> prevents any
      other polymorph effects from restoring the target's true face for the
      spell's duration, though the target can still assume other forms or faces
      via magic or any natural shapechanging ability.</p>
