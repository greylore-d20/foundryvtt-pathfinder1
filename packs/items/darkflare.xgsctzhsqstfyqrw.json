Any creature in the same square as a darkflare when it explodes must make a DC 15 <em>Fortitude</em> save or be unable to see with <em>darkvision</em> for 1d10 rounds. Affected creatures can still see in normal light with no penalty. A darkflare has no effect on creatures without <em>darkvision</em>.
