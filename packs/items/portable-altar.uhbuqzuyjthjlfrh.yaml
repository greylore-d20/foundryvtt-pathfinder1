      <p>Portable altars are typically made of wood and are ornately carved and
      decorated with the religious iconography of a specific religion. The top
      of the altar lifts up, and items such as candles, incense, and oil can be
      stored within. These altars are modest, but give traveling priests a
      center from which to say their daily prayers, perform minor rituals, or
      preach to an assembled crowd.</p>
