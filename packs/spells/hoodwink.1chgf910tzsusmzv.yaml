      <p>You befuddle the targets' senses, preventing the targets from clearly
      perceiving their surroundings.  Instead, <i>hoodwink</i>ed creatures see
      only the roughest shapes and details and hear only muffled noises.
      However, targets can clearly hear verbal communication from the spell's
      caster. This spell does not impart understanding of the caster's language
      if the creature can't already understand it. Other than to hear the caster
      speak, targets automatically fail Perception checks with DCs greater than
      5, and they are too disoriented by the spell to accurately remember the
      path they took while under its effects.  While under the effects of this
      spell, targets without the help of a guide move at half speed, and any
      attacks they make are treated as though the creature they are attacking
      had concealment. Moving faster than half speed requires targets to succeed
      at a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Those that fail this check fall prone. If the
      target is attacked or physically harmed by any creature other than another
      target of <i>hoodwink</i>, the spell's effect ends immediately for that
      target only.</p>
