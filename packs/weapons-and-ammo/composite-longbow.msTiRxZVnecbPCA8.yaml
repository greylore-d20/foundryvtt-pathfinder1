  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You
      can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made
      with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum
      Strength modifier to use it with proficiency). If your Strength modifier
      is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't
      effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The
      default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to
      use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength
      rating to take advantage of an aboveaverage Strength score; this feature
      allows you to add your Strength modifier on damage rolls, up to the
      maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted
      by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. If you have a negative modifier due to
      low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow. A
      composite longbow fires arrows.</p><p>For the purposes of Weapon
      Proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it
      were a longbow.</p>
