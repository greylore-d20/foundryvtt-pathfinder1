  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes one creature within 30 feet to become heavy and
      lethargic. The creature is treated as if it were carrying a medium load
      (see Table 7–5 of the Core Rulebook). If the creature is already carrying
      a medium load, it is instead treated as if it were carrying a heavy load.
      If the creature is carrying a heavy load, its maximum Dexterity bonus to
      AC is reduced to +0, it takes a –9 armor check penalty, and its movement
      is reduced to 5 feet. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the
      shaman’s level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the
      target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
