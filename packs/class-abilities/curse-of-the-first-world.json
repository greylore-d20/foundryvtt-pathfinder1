      "value": "<p>At 15th level, an order of the blossom cavalier channels pandemonium through his weapon. His melee attacks count as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, whenever he confirms a critical hit against a target under an enchantment effect, that target is confused for 1d6 rounds. Each round the confused creature rolls to determine its action, it rolls twice and the cavalier chooses which result to use. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>"
