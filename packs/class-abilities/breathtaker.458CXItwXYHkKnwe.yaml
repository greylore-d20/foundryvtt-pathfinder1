    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian’s blows take the air from her foes’ lungs. While raging,
      whenever the barbarian makes a successful melee attack against an opponent
      that is holding its breath, in addition to any other effects caused by
      that attack, the opponent loses a number of rounds of breath equal to the
      barbarian’s Strength modifier.</p>
