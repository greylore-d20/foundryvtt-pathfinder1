      "value": "<p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Both<br><b>Simple Template</b> No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes<p>“Half-dragon” is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-dragon retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<p><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature + 2 (minimum 3).<p><b>Type:</b> Creature type changes to dragon. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> Nat. armor improves by +4.<p><b>Special Qualities and Defenses:</b> A half-dragon gains darkvision 60 feet; low-light vision; and immunity to sleep, paralysis, and energy of the same type as its breath weapon.<p><b>Speed:</b> A half-dragon has wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed, the half-dragon can fly at twice the creature's base land speed (average maneuverability).<p><b>Melee:</b> A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack. If the base creature can use manufactured weapons, the half-dragon can as well. A new claw or bite attack deals damage as appropriate for the half-dragon's size (see Natural Attacks.)<p><b>Special Abilities:</b> A half-dragon retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains a breath weapon usable once per day based on the dragon variety (see below). The breath weapon deals 1d6 hit points of damage per racial HD possessed by the half-dragon (Reflex half; DC 10 + 1/2 creature's racial HD + creature's Con modifier).</p>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Dragon Variety</b></td>\n<td><b>Breath Weapon</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black or copper</td>\n<td>60–foot line of acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass</td>\n<td>60–foot line of fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue or bronze</td>\n<td>60–foot line of electricity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gold or red</td>\n<td>30–foot cone of fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>30–foot cone of acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver or white</td>\n<td>30–foot cone of cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p><br><b>Abilities:</b> Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +8, Con +6, Int +2, Cha +2.<p><b>Skills:</b> A half-dragon with racial Hit Dice has skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier.
