  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon a black pudding (<i>Bestiary</i> 35) that immediately
      attacks creatures near it. You have no control over the creature, and it
      may attack you if there are no more obvious opponents. The black pudding
      is treated as a summoned creature and has the extraplanar subtype. The
      black pudding's split ability works normally, but all puddings derived
      from the summoned one disappear when the spell ends.</p>
