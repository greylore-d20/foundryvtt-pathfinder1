    "shortDescription": "<p>A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.</p><p>When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted.</p><p>The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as <i>forceful hand</i> or a <i>Wall of Force</i>, but not magical effects such as a <i>Globe of Invulnerability</i> or an <i>antimagic field</i>.</p><p>A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.</p><p>Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.</p>",
