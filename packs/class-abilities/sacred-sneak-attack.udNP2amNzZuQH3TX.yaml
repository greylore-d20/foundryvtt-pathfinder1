  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When making a sneak attack against an undead creature or evil outsider,
      the characterâ€™s sneak attack damage is considered good-aligned for the
      purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Normal weapon damage is unaffected
      for this attack. A character must have a good alignment to select this
      character talent / ninja trick.</p>
