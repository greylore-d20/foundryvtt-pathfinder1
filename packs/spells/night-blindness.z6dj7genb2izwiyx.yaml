      <p>Your target's vision becomes impaired as if the light level were one
      step lower, treating bright light as normal light, normal light as dim
      light, and dim light as darkness. In addition, the subject gains no
      benefit from darkvision, low-light vision, or the see in darkness ability.
      The subject gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist the blind or
      dazzled condition caused by bright light (such as flare). <i>Remove
      blindness/deafness</i> dispels <i>night blindness</i>.</p>
