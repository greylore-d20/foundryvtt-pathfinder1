  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You curse the target with the weaknesses of your kind of vampirism. The
    creature reacts to garlic, mirrors, ringing bells, sunlight, and so on as if
    it were a vampire of the same type as you. This cannot kill the target;
    anything that would kill it (such as a lengthy exposure to sunlight if you
    are a moroi vampire) renders it helpless until the curse or the harmful
    effect is removed. The target gains none of the benefits of being a vampire
    (such as fast healing or requiring special ways to be permanently killed),
    only the penalties.</p>
