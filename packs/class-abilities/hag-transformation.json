Your morale bonus to Strength increases by 2, and you gain low-light vision and darkvision (60 feet), but you take a â€“2 penalty to both Dexterity and Wisdom for the duration of your bloodrage.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, you apply your morale bonus on Will saving throws while bloodraging to Fortitude and Reflex saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities.</p>"
