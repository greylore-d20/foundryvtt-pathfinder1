  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A white, 15-foot-long lash of ghostly evanescence appears from your hand.
    This weapon is treated as a <i>ghost touch whip</i> with no enhancement
    bonus. You can wield it as a whip as if you were proficient. Attacks with a
    <i>ghost whip</i> are resolved as incorporeal touch attacks. The whip
    affects only creatures you attack with it, passing through objects and other
    creatures in its path and thereby allowing you to ignore cover between you
    and your target. When a <i>ghost whip</i> attack passes through total cover,
    the target is treated as having total concealment (50% miss chance). Against
    incorporeal and undead creatures,  a <i>ghost whip</i> deals lethal damage
    and can be used to perform drag or reposition combat maneuvers (in addition
    to a whip's normal disarm and trip maneuvers). A <i>ghost whip</i> cannot be
    disarmed or sundered.</p>
