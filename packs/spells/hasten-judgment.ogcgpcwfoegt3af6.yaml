  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This potent curse weighs upon the target's soul, hastening a living
    creature's journey to the Boneyard upon death or weakening an undead
    creature's animating force. A living creature that dies during the spell's
    duration cannot be affected by <i>Breath of Life</i> or similar effects, and
    the period during which attempts to restore the target to life can succeed
    is reduced to 1 hour/level (for <i>raise</i> dead), 1 day/level (for
    resurrection), or 10 days/level (for <i>true</i> resurrection).
    <i>Reincarnate</i> and similar effects work normally on a creature killed
    under this spell's effects.  An undead creature affected by this spell
    cannot gain temporary hit points, and any existing channel resistance the
    undead may have is reduced by half as long as the curse persists.  Creatures
    whose souls are separate from their bodies (such as liches) or are merged
    with their bodies (such as non-native outsiders) are unaffected by <i>hasten
    judgment</i>.</p>
