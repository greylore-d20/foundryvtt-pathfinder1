  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell induces a hallucinogenic reality in the mind of your target.
    Surfaces seem to swim, and movement constantly distracts the eye. The target
    takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws, caster level checks,
    Intelligence-based skill checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks.</p>
