    value: >-
      <p>You mark the target with a <i>black mark</i>ing on its skin; the mark's
      exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand.
      The <i>black mark</i> functions as a <i>mark of justice</i>, and when the
      mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the
      water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the <i>black
      mark</i> is active, the target is affected as if subject to nature's exile
      (Advanced Player's Guide 233), but all creatures with the aquatic or water
      subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the
      animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not.</p>
