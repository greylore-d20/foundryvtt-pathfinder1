  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Popular in Egorian but rarely seen elsewhere, a barbazu beard is an
      intimidating helm with a full facemask wrought to look like a snarling
      barbazu's head. Extending from the chin area of the face guard is a
      razor-sharp blade much like an actual barbazu's beard, usually 8 inches
      long but sometimes longer. A barbazu beard can be used as an off-hand
      weapon that requires no hands to use; thus, a warrior could combine use of
      a barbazu beard with a two-handed weapon. It otherwise follows all rules
      for using an off-hand weapon. Attacking with a barbazu beard provokes an
      attack of opportunity. Because it is so close to the wearer's face, using
      a barbazu beard against creatures harmful to touch (such as fire
      elementals and acidic oozes) has the same risks as using a natural weapon
      or unarmed strike against these creatures.</p><p>A barbazu beard is a
      light melee exotic weapon.</p>
