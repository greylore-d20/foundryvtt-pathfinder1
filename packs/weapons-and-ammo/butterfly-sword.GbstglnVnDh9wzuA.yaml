  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These short matching swords come in pairs, cleverly nested together to
      appear as a single blade. Both weapons can be drawn at the same time, and
      they can be separated as a free action and wielded in both hands to make
      wickedly effective chops and slashes. Their thin, broad blades extend just
      1 foot in length. A butterfly sword has a hardwood grip covered with
      braided cord, and a metal D-shaped guard to protect the wielder's hand.
      The listed price is for a pair of butterfly swords. Masterwork butterfly
      swords cost 320 gp for the pair. If you add magical enhancement bonuses or
      properties to a butterfly sword, treat each sword in the pair as a
      separate weapon (for example, adding a +1 magical enhancement bonus to a
      pair of masterwork butterfly swords costs 4,000 gp).</p>
