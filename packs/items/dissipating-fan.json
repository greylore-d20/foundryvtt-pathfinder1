You can use a dissipating fan to clear non-magical smoke, fog, or similar vapors from your square or an adjacent square as a <em>full-round action</em>-although dense smoke or fog in the surrounding area eventually refills the space (how long this takes depends on the source and the size of the area, at the GM's discretion). When folded and closed, a dissipating fan is the size of a thick walking stick.</p>\r\n<p>Some dissipating fans are decorated with paint or elaborate embroidery, and have a higher price to reflect their adornment.</p>\r\n\r\n"
