    value: >-
      <p>You can summon a simple or martial weapon from your family's history
      that is appropriate for your current size. You are considered proficient
      with this weapon.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the weapon is considered masterwork.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the weapon gains a cumulative
      +1 enhancement bonus.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, the weapon gains the ghost touch weapon property.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your
      oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must
      be used in 1-minute increments. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it
      leaves your grasp.</p>
