  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a written message of 50 words or fewer, or else an image, a
    drawing, or a similar diagram. The figment hangs invisible and obscured upon
    the target surface for the duration of the spell. Another casting of
    <i>geomessage</i> is needed to cause the figment to arrange itself into the
    intended message.  When you cast the spell, you can choose to incorporate a
    passphrase into the spell. If you do so, the message is protected as if
    <i>nondetection</i> had been cast on it for the full duration of the spell,
    though creatures that cast <i>geomessage</i> on the surface and speak the
    passphrase ignore the <i>nondetection</i> effect and cause the image to
    become visible until the caster speaks the passphrase again.  Without a
    passphrase, the message simply remains invisible to those who cast
    <i>geomessage</i>. Detection methods like <i>detect magic</i> and <i>see
    invisibility</i> indicate the message's presence but do not reveal its
    contents.</p>
