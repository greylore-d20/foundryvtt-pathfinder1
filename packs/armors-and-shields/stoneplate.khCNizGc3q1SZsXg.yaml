  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This armor is crafted by dwarven stonesmiths from alchemically
      strengthened plates of basalt. Stoneplate is heavy and unwieldy, but
      offers incredible protection to its wearer. It is primarily used by
      dwarven druids who cannot wear metal armor.</p>
