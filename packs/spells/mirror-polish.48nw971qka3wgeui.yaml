    value: >-
      <p>You polish a metal item until it is reflective enough to be used as a
      mirror. This does not prevent the item from later damage or corrosion that
      would ruin the mirrored surface.</p><p>The spell can be cast only on a
      metal item with a fairly smooth and contiguous surface, such as a
      breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword, but not a mace, chainmail, or
      scale mail.</p>
