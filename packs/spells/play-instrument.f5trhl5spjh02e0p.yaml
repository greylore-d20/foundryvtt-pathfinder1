      <p>You may play one instrument of your choice as if you had 1 rank in the
      appropriate Perform skill. Instead of a conventional instrument, you may
      use an object as an improvised instrument, such as using a barrel as a
      drum or a bow as a harp, playing it as if it were crafted to make
      music.</p>
