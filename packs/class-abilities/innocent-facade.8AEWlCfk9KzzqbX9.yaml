      <p>Once per day, a character with this talent can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.4w51afqi5d9t8nl4]{Innocence} as a spell-like
      ability, using her character level as the spellâ€™s caster level. A character must
      have the minor magic talent before selecting this talent. An investigator
      can select the innocent facade character talent in place of an investigator
      talent. She must have the underworld inspiration investigator talent
      before selecting this talent, instead of minor magic.</p>
