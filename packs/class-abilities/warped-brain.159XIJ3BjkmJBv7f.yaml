  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, your mind becomes difficult to comprehend. When another
      creature uses a mind-affecting spell or ability against you, that creature
      must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it becomes nauseated for 1
      round.</p>

      <p>This ability triggers even if you succeed at your save (or are
      otherwise unaffected by the spell or ability), but doesn’t apply if you’re
      a willing subject of the spell. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
