    value: >-
      <p>This ballista bolt is specially equipped with a net which unfurls as
      the bolt flies toward its target. Unlike a standard ballista bolt, a
      ballista net requires only a touch attack to hit. If a ballista net hits,
      it deals no damage, but causes the target to become entangled. An
      entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to
      Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run.</p>
