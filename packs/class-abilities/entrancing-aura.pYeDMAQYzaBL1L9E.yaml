  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit an imperceptible 30-foot aura of distraction
      as a standard action for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level.
      These rounds need not be consecutive. Enemies within this aura take a â€“5
      penalty on Perception checks and are treated as though they had 2 fewer
      Hit Dice (minimum 1 Hit Die) for the purpose of your effects that would
      give them the fascinated condition. At 16th level, they are instead
      treated as if they had 3 fewer Hit Dice for such effects.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Charming Smile power of the Charm Domain.</p>
