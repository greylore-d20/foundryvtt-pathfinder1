      <em>You can strike two adjacent foes with a single
      swing.</em><p><b>Prerequisites</b><br>Str 13, Power Attack, base attack
      bonus +1.<p><b>Benefits</b><br>As a standard action, you can make a single
      attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you
      hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using
      your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first
      and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round
      with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your
      Armor Class until your next turn.<p><b>Combat Trick</b><br>When using the
      Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you can spend 4 stamina points to negate the
      -2 penalty to Armor Class until your next turn.
