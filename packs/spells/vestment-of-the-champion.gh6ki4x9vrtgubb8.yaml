      <p>This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.73han2zqxg59u18g]{magic vestment}, except
      it only affects armor or a shield you are wearing or carrying. If the
      armor or shield is worn or carried by anyone other than you, the spell has
      no effect, but resumes its effect when you are wearing or carrying it
      again.</p>
