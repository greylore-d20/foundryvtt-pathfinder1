      <p>These cloaks are popular among traveling <em>bards</em>, and each
      patchwork cloak is unique. The patches represent where the traveler has
      been, and often the performer uses them to recall specific stories from
      his repertoire. When a <em>bard</em> retires or dies, he often bequeaths
      his cloak to a young entertainer he mentored or admired.</p>
