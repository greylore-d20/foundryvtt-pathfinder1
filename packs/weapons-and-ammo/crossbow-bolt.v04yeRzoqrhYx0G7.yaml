      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised
      weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its
      size (critical multiplier x2). Bolts come in a case or quiver that holds
      10 bolts. All crossbows except repeating crossbows use these kinds of
      crossbow bolts, which are sometimes called "quarrels."</p>
