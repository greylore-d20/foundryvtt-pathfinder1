      "value": "<p>At 1st level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, you can sketch a single, nearly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible\">invisible</a>&nbsp;magical rune on any 5-foot-square solid surface. When you create a rune, pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. While the rune is active, the next creature other than you who steps on or touches the rune’s area causes the rune to explode. The rune’s explosion deals a number of points of energy damage equal to 1d8 + 1 per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;level you possess to anything in its square. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;saving throw halves the damage (DC 10 + 1/2 your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;level + your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier). The rune is considered a magical trap for the purpose of perceiving it or disabling it. The DC for both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;checks is the same as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;saving throw to halve the damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. Each rune lasts for 24 hours or until discharged.</p>"
