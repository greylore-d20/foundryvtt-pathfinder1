  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the psychic casts a linked spell that grants her a deflection
      bonus to AC, she can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to automatically
      reflect the first ranged attack that misses her (as long as the linked
      spell remains active) back at the attacker. This reflected attack uses the
      original attack roll plus a circumstance bonus equal to the psychicâ€™s
      caster level.</p>
