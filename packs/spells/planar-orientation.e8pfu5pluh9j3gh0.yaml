  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell helps creatures accustomed to the concrete reality of the
    Material Plane to navigate within the confusing realities of other planes.
    When cast, it functions as <i>know direction</i>, save that instead of
    revealing true north, it reveals the direction of the palace or demesnes
    most associated with that plane or demiplane's ruling god or demigod, as
    well as a brief and generic vision of that entity's appearance or holy
    symbol. The spell functions only within whatever plane or demiplane you are
    located in at the time; for instance, if cast within a specific demon lord's
    Abyssal realm or on a given layer of Hell, it would point to the seat of
    power for that demon lord or archdevil, not Lamashtu or Asmodeus. If a plane
    or demiplane has multiple gods or rulers, such as the Eldest of the First
    World or Heaven's various Empyreal Lords and deities, it reveals the
    directions of the closest three, allowing for triangulation.  This spell
    reveals the location of the god or demigod's official seat of power only,
    not the entity itself, and if such a location is deliberately hidden via
    magic of any sort, the spell automatically fails. It does not function on
    the Material Plane.</p>
