  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can create a wooden shortspear appropriate to
      your size, which hurls itself as a ranged attack against one target within
      100 feet (range penalties apply), using your Intelligence modifier as an
      attack bonus instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The spear
      deals normal damage according to its size, plus your Intelligence
      modifier, then breaks into countless splinters; the target takes 1 point
      of bleed damage each round on its turn. At 6th-level and every 6 levels
      thereafter, the spear gains a +1 enhancement bonus and the bleed damage
      increases by +1. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
      to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
