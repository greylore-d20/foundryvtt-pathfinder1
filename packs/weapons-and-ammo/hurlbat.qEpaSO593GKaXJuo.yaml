      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><b>Damage</b> 1d4 (small), 1d6 (medium);
      <b>Critical</b> x3; <b>Range</b> 10 ft.; <b>Type</b> P and
      S</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A hurlbat is a throwing axe made from a single
      piece of flat metal. Every extremity of the hurlbat is sharpened,
      including the point of the handle. You can wield the hurlbat as a melee
      weapon, but it's not designed for such use; you take a -1 penalty on melee
      attack rolls with the weapon, and you must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save
      when making melee attacks to avoid cutting yourself on an edge and taking
      1 point of slashing damage. You don't need to attempt this save while
      wearing heavy armor.</p>
