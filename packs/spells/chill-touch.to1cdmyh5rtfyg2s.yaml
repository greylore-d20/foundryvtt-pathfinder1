      <p>A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life
      force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals
      1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength
      damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use
      this melee touch attack up to one time per level.</p><p>An undead creature
      you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful
      Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per
      caster level.</p>
