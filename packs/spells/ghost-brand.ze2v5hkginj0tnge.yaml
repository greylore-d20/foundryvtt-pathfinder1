  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You alter the fundamental substance of a single object up to 2 cubic
      feet per level in size and at least one size category smaller than the
      target creature, causing it to become shadowy and intangible, as though
      made out of quasi-real shadowstuff. You link the intangible item to the
      target's flesh by making a brand shaped like the item on the target's
      skin. The intangible item merges with the target's flesh and is contained
      within the target's body, moving with the target wherever it goes. The
      creature can retrieve the item or reabsorb it as a full-round action, and
      can do so as many times as it wants. When worn or wielded by the target,
      the item regains its solidity and functions normally, though the target
      can't drop or remove the item (other than by using the full-round action),
      nor can it be disarmed or stolen. If the item is destroyed, the spell
      ends. If the <i>ghost brand</i> spell is dispelled while the object is
      inside the target's body,  the object bursts out of the target's flesh,
      dealing 3d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to the target that
      bypasses DR, as well as 1d6 points of bleed damage.</p>
