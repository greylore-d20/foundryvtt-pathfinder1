      <p><em>You can perform an unarmed strike that greatly hampers your
      target's movement.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed
      Strike}.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: To use this feat, you must make
      a single unarmed attack as a standard action. If this unarmed attack hits,
      you deal damage normally, and the target's base land speed is reduced to 5
      feet for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier unless it makes
      a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis
      modifier).</p>
