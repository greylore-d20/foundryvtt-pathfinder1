  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By expending 1 point of mental focus as a standard action, you can
      create a wall of pure energy with a length of up to 5 feet per occultist
      level you possess. This wall is 10 feet high and 1 foot thick. It doesn’t
      block passage, line of sight, or line of effect, but does deal damage to
      anyone passing through it. The wall deals 2d6 points of energy damage + 1
      point of energy damage per occultist level you possess. You must select
      acid, cold, electricity, or fire when you create the wall to determine the
      type of damage it deals. The wall must be straight, and can’t pass through
      a creature’s space when created. The wall lasts for 1 round per occultist
      level you possess.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.</p>
