      charge</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A detonator is a small device that can be
      used to trigger cranial bombs, cylex, and other explosives remotely. While
      an explosive is being set, the user can key the explosive to a detonator
      with a standard action that costs the detonator one charge. Once the
      explosive is keyed, as a standard action the user can push a button to
      trigger the explosive. A typical detonator has a range of 1,000 feet-
      though some may have a reduced range (intentionally or otherwise) and
      others might be enhanced by a signal booster (see page
      51).</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 23;
