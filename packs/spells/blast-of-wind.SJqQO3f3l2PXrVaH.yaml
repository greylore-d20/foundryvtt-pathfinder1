      <p>With a spiraling gesture of your hand and a forceful exhalation, you
      create a brief but fierce (90 mph) blast of wind. This spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.cnuin981hdq7ryit]{Gust of Wind}, except all
      creatures within the area are treated as though they were one size
      category smaller for the purpose of determining how the spell affects
      them. For every 4 caster levels beyond 7th, creatures in the area are
      treated as an additional size category smaller (to a maximum of three size
      categories smaller at 15th level).</p>
