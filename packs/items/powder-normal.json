Throwing a bag of powder into a square is an attack against AC 5, and momentarily reveals if there is an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible\">invisible</a> creature there. A much more effective method is to spread powder on a surface (which takes 1 full round) and look for footprints.</p>\r\n"
