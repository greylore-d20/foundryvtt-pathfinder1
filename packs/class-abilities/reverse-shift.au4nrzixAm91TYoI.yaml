      <p>You reverse the flow of your connection to the planes, sending your
      body into the Ethereal Plane as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.btccs4sjo2nog1a0]{Ethereal Jaunt}. As long as you
      concentrate on reverse shift, you remain on the Ethereal Plane; after a
      number of consecutive rounds spent on the Ethereal Plane equal to your
      kineticist level (and every such interval thereafter), you must accept 1
      point of burn.</p>

      <p>Once you return to the Material Plane, you cannot use reverse shift
      again for a number of rounds equal to the number of rounds you spent on
      the Ethereal Plane.</p>
