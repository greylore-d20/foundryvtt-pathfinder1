    value: >-
      <p>An unseen crew member is an invisible, shapeless force that performs
      the duties of one crew member. It can tie off ropes, hoist sails, swab
      decks, and other such duties. An unseen crew member possesses no other
      skills. It cannot fight, speak, or even defend itself.</p><p>An unseen
      crew member has a Strength score of 10 and a Profession (sailor) score
      equal to half your character level plus your Intelligence modifier (for
      witches and wizards) or your Charisma modifier (for bards, sorcerers, and
      summoners). It cannot fly, but it can climb, swim, or walk with a base
      speed of 20 feet.</p><p>An unseen crew member cannot be killed, but it
      dissipates if it takes more than 1 point of damage per caster level you
      possess from area attacks (it gets no saves against attacks). If you
      attempt to send an unseen crew member beyond the spell's range (measured
      from your current position), the crew member ceases to exist.</p>
