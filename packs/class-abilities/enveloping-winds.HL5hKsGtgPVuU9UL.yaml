    value: >-
      <p><b>Element</b> air; <b>Type</b> defense (Su); <b>Level</b> —;
      <b>Burn</b> 0</p>

      <p>You constantly surround yourself with a whirling torrent of air,
      crackling arcs of lightning, or both to protect yourself from ranged
      attacks. All ranged attacks made with physical weapons suffer a 20% miss
      chance against you, except for attacks from massive weapons such as a
      giant’s thrown boulder or a ballista. This ability has no effect on ray
      attacks.</p>

      <p>The miss chance increases by 5% for every 5 kineticist levels you
      possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the
      miss chance by 5% until the next time your burn is removed. You can
      continue to accept points of burn to increase the miss chance further, up
      to a maximum of 75%.</p>

      <p>Whenever you accept burn while using an air wild talent, the energy
      surging through you causes your enveloping winds to also affect
      non-physical ranged attacks such as ray attacks for 1 round. You can
      dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.</p>
