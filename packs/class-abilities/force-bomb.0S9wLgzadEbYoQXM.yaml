  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict
      force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points
      of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures
      that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they
      succeed on a Reflex save.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
