      <p>This spell conjures a miniature sphere of sunlight, approximately the
      size of a human fist, at a desired location within range. The sphere sheds
      bright light in a 60-foot-radius burst. Creatures that take penalties in
      bright light do so while within the sphere's area of illumination.
      Creatures that start their turns within the area of illumination and that
      are damaged or destroyed by sunlight must succeed at a Fortitude save or
      become staggered until 1d4+1 rounds after they leave the affected area.
      Non-creatures, such as hazardous fungi and mold that are destroyed by
      sunlight, become inert for the duration of the spell.  The sphere cannot
      be moved from the place it was cast. The sphere deals 10d6 points of fire
      damage to anything it touches and anything that passes within 5 feet of
      it. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half.</p>
