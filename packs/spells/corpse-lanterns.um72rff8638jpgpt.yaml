  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>dancing lights</i>, except it summons up to
      four spheres of light, each of which glows a sickly pale green. These
      <i>corpse lanterns</i> shed dim light in a 20-foot radius, and do not
      increase the light level in areas of normal light or bright light. In dim
      or normal light, the radiance of <i>corpse lanterns</i> provides a strange
      contrast, giving all creatures in the area a -5 penalty on Stealth checks.
      In addition, the hue interferes with illusion (pattern) spells, giving all
      creatures in the illuminated area a +2 bonus on any saving throws against
      such spells. Unlike <i>dancing lights</i>, you may have more than one
      <i>corpse lanterns</i> spell active at a time, but you may only move one
      set in any given round.</p><p>Moving the <i>corpse lanterns</i> does not
      require concentration.</p><p><i>Corpse lanterns</i> can be made permanent
      on an area with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of at least 11th
      level for the cost of 7,500 gp.</p>
