  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a
    significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all
    bombs you create and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on
    your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify
    your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the
    word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another
    bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one
    becomes active.  When you throw a bomb and hit a direct target, a shadowy
    substance is released from the bomb covering the direct target and up to
    three creatures that take damage from the bomb's splash (alchemist's
    choice). The affected creatures must successfully make a Fortitude saving
    throw, or they gain concealment but treat all other creatures as having
    concealment for the duration of the <i>shadow bomb admixture</i>. This
    effect does not ignore spell resistance.</p>
