  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create one or more 5-foot cubes of temporal possibility where your
      timeline overlaps with those of your parallel existences. As a free
      action, you can summon a duplicate of yourself (not including any animal
      companions, familiars, intelligent items, or other creatures) from an
      alternate timeline in one of the cubes you can see, which lasts until the
      end of your turn. This duplicate has your statistics (though its hit
      points equal your caster level), threatens all squares adjacent to it, and
      has any teamwork feats you have. Although the duplicate appears with all
      of the equipment you currently carry, it cannot use any of its equipment
      and all its equipment disappears when the duplicate does. This duplicate
      cannot voluntarily move from the space in which it's summoned. During its
      brief existence, a duplicate can use the aid another action once to assist
      you, but it cannot take any other type of action. Once a duplicate
      disappears, the cube of temporal possibility it occupied dissipates.  You
      can summon only one duplicate before the spell ends. For every 4 caster
      levels you have beyond 3rd, you can summon an additional duplicate before
      the spell ends, though you cannot have more than one duplicate in
      existence at once.</p>
