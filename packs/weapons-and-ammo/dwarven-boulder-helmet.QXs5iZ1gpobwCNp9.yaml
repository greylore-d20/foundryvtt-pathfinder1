      B</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This heavy, reinforced helmet can be used to
      make melee attacks. The wearer may also use the helmet when attempting
      bull rush maneuvers, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on the check, but
      after completing the maneuver (whether successful or not), the wearer is
      staggered until the end of his next turn. In addition, the helmet grants a
      +2 circumstance bonus to the wearer's AC against critical hit confirmation
      rolls. A dwarven boulder helmet adds 20% to the wearer's arcane spell
      failure chance. It occupies the head slot and is made of metal, not stone,
      meaning that it can be crafted from unusual materials as a metal weapon. A
      dwarven boulder helmet can be enchanted as a weapon (not as armor, despite
      providing some protection).</p>
