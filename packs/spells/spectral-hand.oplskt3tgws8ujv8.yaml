  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A ghostly hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you
    desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance.
    On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell
    ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit
    points can be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch
    range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the
    <i>spectral hand</i>. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch
    attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The
    hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like
    a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if it goes beyond the spell
    range or goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and
    hovers.</p><p>The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal
    weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no
    damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of 22 (+8 size,
    +4 natural armor). Your Intelligence modifier applies to the hand's AC as if
    it were the hand's Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the
    same number that you lost in creating it.</p>
