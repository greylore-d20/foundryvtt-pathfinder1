    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can force a creature within line of sight to reroll
      any one roll that it has just made before the result of the roll is
      revealed. The result of the reroll must be taken, even if it is worse than
      the original roll. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and
      one additional time per day for every 6 levels beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This pwoer replaces the Good Fortune power of the Luck Domain.</p>
