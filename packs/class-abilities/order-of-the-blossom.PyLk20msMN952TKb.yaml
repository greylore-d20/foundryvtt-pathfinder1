    value: >-
      <p>Cavaliers of the order of the blossom dedicate their lives to
      protecting fey, especially those visiting the Material Plane from the
      First World. These cavaliers might be fey themselves, but even if they
      aren’t, they exhibit the same whimsy and occasionally cruel sense of humor
      typical of most denizens of the First World.<p><b>Edicts:</b> The cavalier
      cannot refuse a fey’s request for aid unless it will interfere with his
      existing duties, or he believes the fey seeks to directly oppose his other
      aims and goals. He must strive to prevent gates to the First World from
      being exploited or corrupted. If the cavalier encounters <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Blighted%20Fey%20(Satyr)">blighted
      fey</a> or other corrupted fey, he must strive to destroy
      them.<p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever an order of the blossom cavalier issues
      a challenge, the target of the challenge takes a –1 penalty on saving
      throws against spells and spell-like abilities used by fey or by the
      cavalier. This penalty increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has.
      An order of the blossom cavalier can’t issue a challenge against any
      creature of the fey type unless that creature has the blighted fey
      template.<p><b>Skills:</b> An order of the blossom cavalier adds Disguise
      and Knowledge (nature) to his list of class skills. An order of the
      blossom cavalier can attempt Knowledge (nature) skill checks untrained.
      Whenever an order of the blossom cavalier attempts a Bluff check to feint
      in combat, he receives a bonus on the check equal to half his cavalier
      level (minimum +1).</p>
