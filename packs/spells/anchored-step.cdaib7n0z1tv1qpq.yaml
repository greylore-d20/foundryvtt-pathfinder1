  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Powerful tendrils grow out of the bottom of your feet or footwear,
      partially anchoring you to the ground and making it more difficult for
      others to move you against your will.</p><p>These tendrils dig into any
      surface, but leave no trace of your passing. You gain a +10 bonus to your
      CMD against bull rush, overrun, pull, push, reposition, and trip combat
      maneuvers, as well as any other effect that would move you from your
      current position (such as being swallowed whole) or knock you prone. The
      tendrils slow your movement, however; your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to
      a minimum of 5 feet). This spell has no effect if you are moving without
      touching the ground (climbing, flying, swimming, and so on).</p>
