This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. While in wave form, you are immune to weapon attacks and attacks that target a specific number of creatures (since the spell is instantaneous, this is mainly relevant for readied actions and the like). All creatures and unattended objects in your path take 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A successful Reflex save prevents a creature from being knocked prone.</p>",
