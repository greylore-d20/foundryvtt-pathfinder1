      <p>This spell clouds the mind of a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer Hit
      Dice so that it takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not
      affected. A dazed subject is not stunned, so attackers get no special
      advantage against it. After a creature has been dazed by this spell, it is
      immune to the effects of this spell for 1 minute.</p>
