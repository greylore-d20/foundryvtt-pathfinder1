  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Inquisitors and rangers alike learned long ago that knowledge of an
      enemy grants power over that enemy. This spell was created so that almost
      any enemy could have its vulnerabilities known and exploited.</p><p>For
      the duration of this spell you may spend a full-round action to take 20 on
      any Knowledge skill checks made to identify a foe's weaknesses, provided
      the foe in question is within line of sight and provided that you have at
      least one rank in that particular Knowledge skill. This spell allows you
      to make untrained Knowledge checks to determine a monster's weaknesses as
      if you had ranks in that skill, but you cannot take 20 on these
      checks.</p>
