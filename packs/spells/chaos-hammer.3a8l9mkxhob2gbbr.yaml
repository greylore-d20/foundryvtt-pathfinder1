      <p>You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the
      form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting energy. Only
      lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the
      spell.</p><p>The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels
      (maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster
      level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and <i>slow</i>s them for 1d6
      rounds (see the <i>slow</i> spell). A successful Will save reduces the
      damage by half and negates the <i>slow</i> effect.</p><p>The spell deals
      only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and
      they are not <i>slow</i>ed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half
      again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.</p>
