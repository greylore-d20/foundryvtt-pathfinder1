  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon acts as a kumade, but the handle consists of bamboo
      sections held together by a taut rope running through the center.
      Releasing the rope is a standard action that provokes attacks of
      opportunity and causes the weapon to collapse into a bundle that fits into
      a backpack. Reassembling the collapsible kumade requires a full-round
      action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
