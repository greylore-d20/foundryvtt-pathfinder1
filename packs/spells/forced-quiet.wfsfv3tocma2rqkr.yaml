  shortDescription: >-
    <p>With a gesture, you muffle sound around the target, making it unable to
    yell or otherwise make loud noises. This does not affect spellcasting by the
    target. The target can still use sonic effects, but the DC of these effects
    decreases by 2. The target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against sonic
    effects. The target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks.</p>
