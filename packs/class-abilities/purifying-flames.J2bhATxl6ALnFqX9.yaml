    value: >-
      <p><b>Element</b> fire; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 4;
      <b>Burn</b> 1</p>

      <p>You use fire to burn poison from within a creatureâ€™s veins. You must
      attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your kineticist level) against the DC
      of each poison affecting the target. Success means that the poison is
      neutralized, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.6l904edkt8jv9jor]{Neutralize
      Poison}.</p>

      <p>When you attempt to neutralize poison in this way, you can choose to
      deal a number of points of fire damage to the poisoned creature equal to
      the amount of damage you normally take from accepting burn in order to
      reduce the DC of one poison affecting the target by 2. This reduction
      remains until the end of your next turn.</p>
