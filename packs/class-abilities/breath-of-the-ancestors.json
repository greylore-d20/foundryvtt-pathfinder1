      "value": "<p>The ninja chooses one imperial dragon type (forest, sea, sky, sovereign, or underworld;&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 92-103) when she gains this trick, and the choice can’t be changed. She can use supplies similar to those used for ninja smoke bombs to produce an alchemical breath weapon that deals the same kind of damage as the selected dragon (piercing damage for forest dragons, fire for sea dragons, and so on). The breath weapon deals the same amount of damage as the ninja’s sneak attack, with a Reflex save allowed for half damage. The breath weapon is a 15-foot cone (or a 30-foot line if the underworld dragon is selected). The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja’s class level + the ninja’s Intelligence modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that expends up 2 ki points, and once used it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.</p>"
