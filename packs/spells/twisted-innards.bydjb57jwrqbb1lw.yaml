  description:
    value: >-
      <p>For the duration of this spell, your vital organs writhe, shift, and
      move about, making it difficult to strike you in a vulnerable area. While
      this spell is in effect, critical hits and sneak attacks against you have
      a 25% chance of failing to inflict any additional damage-though you still
      take the normal damage from the attack. At 7th level, the chance to ignore
      additional damage increases to 50%, while at 13th level the chance
      increases to 75%.</p>
