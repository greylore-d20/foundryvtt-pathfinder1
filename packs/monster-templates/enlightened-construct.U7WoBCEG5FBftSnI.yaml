      <p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong> Acquired<br
      /><strong>Simple Template</strong> No<br /><strong>Usable with
      Summons</strong> No</p><p>Infused with powerful psychic energy,
      enlightened constructs have access to strange and deadly mental powers.
      Highly intelligent and secretive, these constructs typically serve as
      henchmen to powerful psychics or sorcerous cabals.</p><p>“Enlightened
      construct” is an acquired template that can be added to any construct,
      referred to hereafter as the base creature. An enlightened construct
      retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as
      noted here.</p><p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> If the base creature
      had 4 or fewer HD, base creature’s CR + 1; HD 5–10, base creature’s CR +
      2; HD 11 or more, base creature’s CR +
      3.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> An enlightened construct’s alignment
      is no more than one step away from that of its
      creator.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> An enlightened construct gains the
      augmented subtype.</p><p><strong>Senses:</strong> An enlightened construct
      gains lifesense out to 60 feet.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> An
      enlightened construct gains the following weakness.</p><p><em>Susceptible
      to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex):</em> An enlightened construct is
      susceptible to mind-affecting effects, even though it is a construct.
      Although they can be magically charmed or compelled, enlightened
      constructs are particularly resistant to enchantments and receive a +4
      bonus on Will saves to resist these effects.</p><p><strong>Special
      Attacks:</strong> An enlightened construct gains the following special
      abilities.</p><p><em>Mind Thrust (Sp):</em> An enlightened construct can
      use <em>mind thrust</em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day
      equal to 2 + the enlightened construct’s Intelligence modifier. The
      version of <em>mind thrust</em> available to an enlightened construct is
      determined by its Hit Dice: HD Spell</p><hr

      Abilities (Sp):</strong> An enlightened construct gains a number of
      spell-like abilities set by its Hit Dice. It gains the spell-like
      abilities listed in the entry for its Hit Dice on the table below, as well
      as all listed spell-like abilities for prior entries. Unless otherwise
      noted, each ability is usable 1/day. The caster level for these abilities
      is equal to the enlightened construct’s Hit Dice (or the caster level of
      the base construct’s spell-like abilities, whichever is higher). The DC
      for a saving throw against the enlightened construct’s spell-like ability
      is equal to 10 + the spell’s level + the enlightened construct’s
      Intelligence modifier.</p><hr

      Scores:</strong> If the base creature had an Intelligence score of 9 or
      less, roll 2d6+4 to determine the enlightened construct’s new Intelligence
      score. If the base creature had an Intelligence score of 10 or greater,
      increase its Intelligence score by 6. Additionally, increase the
      enlightened construct’s Charisma score by
      2d6.</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Since it has an Intelligence score, an
      enlightened construct gains feats as normal for a creature of its Hit
      Dice.</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> An enlightened construct gains skill
      points according to its new Intelligence score, which are assigned
      appropriately for its function, as determined by the
      GM.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> An enlightened construct speaks one
      language that its creator spoke, plus a number of additional languages
      that its creator knew equal to the enlightened construct’s Intelligence
      bonus (if any). The enlightened construct can also communicate by
      telepathy up to a range of 100 feet.</p><p><strong>Special
      Qualities:</strong> An enlightened construct gains the following special
      qualities.</p><p><em>Artificial Soul (Su):</em> Though not the true soul
      of a living creature, the enlightened construct’s artificial soul provides
      it with a unique personality and a spark of sentience. Unlike most
      constructs, the enlightened construct is not immune to necromantic
      effects. Enlightened constructs are still immune to death effects and they
      cannot be raised or resurrected. Enlightened construct golems are still
      immune to magic as described in their entries.</p><p><em>Phrenic Stone
      (Su):</em> An enlightened construct has a stone infused with supernatural
      mental energy embedded into its head or chest that is the source of its
      awakened intellect. If an enlightened construct is destroyed but this
      phrenic stone remains intact, it can be used to create another enlightened
      construct, using the same cost as augmenting a new enlightened construct
      (see Construction below). When a phrenic stone is used to create a new
      enlightened construct, the personality and memories of the previous
      enlightened construct are lost. A phrenic stone has hardness 10, 20 hit
      points, and a break DC of 30.</p>
