  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light
      crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A light
      crossbow fires crossbow bolts.</p><p>Normally, operating a light crossbow
      requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow
      with one hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light
      crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if
      attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the
      penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
