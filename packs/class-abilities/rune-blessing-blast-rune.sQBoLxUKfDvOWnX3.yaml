  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent square. Any
      creature entering this square takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2
      your warpriest level. This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or
      fire damage, designated when you create the rune. The rune is invisible,
      and lasts a number of rounds equal to your warpriest level or until
      discharged. You cannot create a blast rune in a square occupied by another
      creature.</p>

      <p>This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purposes of dispelling.
      It can be discovered with a successful DC 26 Perception skill check and
      disarmed with a successful DC 26 Disable Device skill check.</p>
