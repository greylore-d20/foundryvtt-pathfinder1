This ability allows the eidolon to pinpoint the location of creatures that it can’t see without having to attempt a Perception check, but such creatures still have total concealment from the eidolon.</p>\n<p>Visibility still affects the eidolon’s movement, and it is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.&nbsp;</p>"
