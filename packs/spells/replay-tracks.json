You can attempt Survival checks to follow tracks as part of concentrating on the spell, but only events connected to the tracks used as the focus of the spell are revealed by the spell. Elements that left no trace detectable by you, such as creatures benefitting from <i>pass without trace</i>, are absent from the events you visualize.</p>",
