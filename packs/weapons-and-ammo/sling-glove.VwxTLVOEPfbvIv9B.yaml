      Groups</b> Thrown</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This curved, scooped-shaped,
      2-foot-long wicker basket attaches to your wrist, allowing you to throw
      fist-sized stones at great speed merely by whipping your arm forward.
      Loading a sling glove is a free action that does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity so long as you have a free hand. You take -4 penalty when
      throwing a stone at an adjacent target and cannot use the weapon to attack
      creatures in your space.</p>
