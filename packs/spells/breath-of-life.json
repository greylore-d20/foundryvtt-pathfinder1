    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).</p><p>Unlike other spells that heal damage, <i>Breath of Life</i> can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through <i>Breath of Life</i> gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day.</p><p>Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by <i>Breath of Life</i>.</p><p>Like cure spells, <i>Breath of Life</i> deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.</p>",
