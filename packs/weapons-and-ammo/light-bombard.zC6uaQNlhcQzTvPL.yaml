      traditional cannons, these firearms lob their ammunition in an arc in
      order to deliver their deadly payloads over troops or castle walls.
      Bombards are normally fired indirectly, but can also be fired as
      direct-fire siege engines. When they are used for direct fire, they take a
      -4 penalty on attack rolls and have their range increment halved, but do
      not have a minimum range. Like all firearms, bombards do not suffer
      mishaps, but instead have a misfire chance.</p><p><em>Light</em>: These
      bombards resemble cauldrons attached to swivels. Often they are mounted
      into the ground or into the stone of castle walls because of the mighty
      power of their recoil. The targeting DC of a light bombard is 15. A light
      bombard has a base misfire range of 1-2 (10 feet). Light bombards have a
      hardness of 10 and 70 hit points. Light bombard balls cost 30 gp each and
      weigh 25 pounds.</p>
