  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can touch a creature to suppress or protect it from more
      debilitating negative conditions.</p><p>Each time she uses this hex, the
      witch either chooses the blinded or deafened condition, or chooses a type
      of effect: curse, disease, or poison.</p><ul><li><p>If the target is or
      later becomes afflicted with the chosen condition or effect, that
      condition or effect is suppressed for a number of minutes equal to the
      witch’s level.</p></li><li><p>Alternatively, for 24 hours the witch can
      grant her target a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against effects
      that cause any two of the above conditions or effects (witch’s choice; she
      can choose any combination of conditions or effects, as long as she
      chooses only two total).</p></li></ul><p>At 15th level, the witch can
      choose up to two total conditions or types of effects to suppress or three
      total conditions or types of effects to grant a circumstance bonus against
      each time she uses the major ameliorating hex.</p><p>Once a creature has
      benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.</p>
