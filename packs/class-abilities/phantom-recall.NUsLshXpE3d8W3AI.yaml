  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, as either a swift or an immediate action, a spiritualist
      can call her manifested phantom to her side or back into her
      consciousness. This ability functions as dimension door, using the
      spiritualistâ€™s class level as the caster level. When the spiritualist
      calls the phantom in this way, the phantom appears adjacent to the
      spiritualist (or as close as possible, if all adjacent spaces are
      occupied).<p>When the spiritualist uses this ability to call the phantom
      back to her consciousness, she can activate bonded manifestation as part
      of that action, but doing so costs 1 extra round of bonded
      manifestation.<p>The spiritualist can use this ability once per day at 6th
      level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels
      she possesses beyond 6th.</p>
