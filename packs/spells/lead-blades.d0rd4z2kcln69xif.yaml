  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Lead blades</i> increases the momentum and density of your melee
      weapons just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are carrying when
      the spell is cast deal damage as if one size category larger than they
      actually are. For instance, a Medium longsword normally deals 1d8 points
      of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if benefiting
      from <i>lead blades</i> (see page 145 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> for more
      information). Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses
      one of your weapons to make an attack it deals damage as normal for its
      size.</p>
