There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Repellent Cartridge</em></strong>: (<strong>Source</strong> <em>People of the Wastes pg. 15</em>) This cartridge can be used only in early or advanced firearms with the scatter weapon quality. To use a repellent cartridge, make a scattering shot against an AC of 5. If you succeed, you create a cone of foul fumes that lasts for 2 rounds, after which the stench becomes inert and dissipates. Any creature within this area when the fumes are created or any creature that enters the fumes while they are active must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d6 rounds. Being affected by the fumes multiple times lengthens the duration of the sickened condition. If your attack results in a misfire that causes your firearm to explode, the area of the cloud is instead centered on one corner of your square (your choice), with a radius equal to the firearm's misfire burst size. Firing this cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
