  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool, the psychic grants any
      creature she conjures or summons with the linked spell a +2 deflection
      bonus to AC. This bonus lasts for 1 round per caster level or until the
      creature disappears, whichever comes first.</p>

      <p>This amplification can be linked only to conjuration (calling) or
      conjuration (summoning) spells.</p>

      <p>The bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and to +4 at 15th level.</p>
