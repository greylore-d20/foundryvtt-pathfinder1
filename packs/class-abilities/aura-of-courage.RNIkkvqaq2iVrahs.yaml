  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each
      ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on <em>saving
      throws</em> against fear effects. This ability functions only while the
      paladin is conscious, not if she is <em>unconscious</em> or dead.</p>
