  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A ward curses an enemy who attacks the subject. While this trick is
      implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on the subject’s forehead.
      The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or
      becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker
      takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill
      checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty
      applies to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect.</p>
