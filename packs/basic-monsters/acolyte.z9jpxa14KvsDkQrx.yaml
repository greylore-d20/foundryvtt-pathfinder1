          <p>In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater
          purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all
          priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their
          people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries
          of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms
          and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions
          and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to
          spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they
          might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one
          another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and
          redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading
          conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all
          who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the
          arms of the gods themselves.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: More than
          capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics
          often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies
          in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether
          to increase their own and their allies’ prowess in battle, to vex
          their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in
          need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must
          focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of
          clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to
          a divine concept worthy of devotion—such as battle, death, justice, or
          knowledge—free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you
          prefer this path to selecting a specific
          deity.)</p><p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A cleric’s alignment must be
          within one step of her deity’s, along either the law/chaos axis or the
          good/evil axis.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The cleric’s class skills
          are Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis),
          Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge
          (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion)
          (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and
          Spellcraft (Int).</p>

          <p>Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by
          channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol.
          This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type
          of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.</p>

          <p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity)
          channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to
          <em>undead</em> creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric
          (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative
          energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal
          <em>undead</em> creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity (or one
          who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she
          channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it
          cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric
          can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous
          casting).</p>

          <p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one
          type (either <em>undead</em> or living) in a 30-foot radius centered
          on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6
          points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels
          beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take
          damage from channeled energy receive a <em>Will</em> save to halve the
          damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric’s level +
          the cleric’s <em>Charisma</em> modifier. Creatures healed by channel
          energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing
          is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal
          to 3 + her <em>Charisma</em> modifier. This is a standard action that
          does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether
          or not to include herself in this effect.</p>

          <p>A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this
          ability.</p>

          <p>A cleric’s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can
          perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two
          <em>domains</em> from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can
          select an alignment <em>domain</em> (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only
          if her alignment matches that <em>domain</em>. If a cleric is not
          devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two <em>domains</em>
          to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities (subject to GM
          approval). The restriction on alignment <em>domains</em> still
          applies.</p>

          <p>Each <em>domain</em> grants a number of <em>domain</em> powers,
          dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus
          spells. A cleric gains one <em>domain</em> spell slot for each level
          of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can
          prepare one of the spells from her two <em>domain</em>s in that slot.
          If a <em>domain</em> spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric
          can prepare it only in her <em>domain</em> spell slot. Domain spells
          cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.</p>

          <p>In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her
          domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted,
          activating a domain power is a standard action.</p>

          <p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel
          stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead
          of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not an
          orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same
          spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its
          name).</p>

          <p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity) can’t convert
          prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells
          (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).</p>

          <p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither
          good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict
          spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot
          be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric channels
          positive or negative energy (see channel energy).</p>

          energy that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
          (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell
          deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead
          creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to
          take half damage.</p>

        <p>An acolyte is a priest in training, often a callow youth fresh from
        the cloisters, loaded with zeal but not much practiced in proselytism.
        They are found in temples and monasteries throughout the world, and
        their enthusiasm and devotion makes them eager to take up arms and armor
        to defend their faith and flocks.</p><p>Acolytes of different faiths can
        be easily created by simply changing their domains, spells, armor, or
        weapons. Evil acolytes might have the Death and Evil domains, for
        example, and channel negative energy instead. An acolyte of nature could
        have the Animal and Plant domains, and wear leather
        armor.</p><p>Acolytes can be temple caretakers or messengers, attendants
        at small roadside shrines and chapels, or assistants to more experienced
        priests. A pair of acolytes may accompany a temple guard (CR 3), a
        pilgrim (CR 4), or a medium (CR 5).</p>
