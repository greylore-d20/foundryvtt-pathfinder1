  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon consists of a foot-long double-edged blade, with another
      smaller, curved hook-blade sticking out the side like a rooster's spur.
      The blade is strung to a large iron hoop with a 10-foot length of rope.
      The blade can be used as an off-handed melee weapon or thrown like a
      dagger, while the rope and circlet can be whipped around and swung at
      opponents as a bludgeoning reach weapon.</p>
