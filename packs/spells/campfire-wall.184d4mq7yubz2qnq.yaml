    value: >-
      <p>You can create a barrier around a fire of at least campfire size that
      shelters everyone inside so long as the fire continues to burn. The
      barrier appears as a crackling sphere of light and fire that is clearly
      visible, providing as much illumination as a torch.</p><p>The barrier
      bocks line of sight, granting creatures on either side of the barrier
      total concealment from creatures on the other side. Any object or creature
      passing through the barrier from outside takes 1d6 points of fire damage
      and is also outlined with light equivalent to that of a torch, for 1d6
      minutes. Creatures outlined in this way are plainly visible regardless of
      the light conditions and do not benefit from any sort of concealment,
      magical or otherwise. The light is not bright enough to have any special
      effect on undead or creatures vulnerable to light.</p><p>Creatures inside
      the barrier can leave without penalty, but if they try to return they
      suffer the same consequences as anyone else. If the fire source at the
      barrier's center is extinguished or moved, the spell ends.</p>
