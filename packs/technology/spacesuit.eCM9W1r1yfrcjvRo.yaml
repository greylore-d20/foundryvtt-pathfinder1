      airtight suit of synthetic polymers includes a transparent, dome-like
      helmet that completely covers the wearer's head. A spacesuit is nearly
      identical in function to an HEV suit (see page 31), except that as long as
      the spacesuit is charged, it provides a bit more armor protection as well
      as complete protection from all radiation and exposure to vacuum. A
      spacesuit repairs damage to itself at the rate of 4d6 points of damage per
      charge consumed. It has hardness 6 and 60 hit points.</p><p>A space suit
      is fitted with numerous small booster jets that grant the wearer a fly
      speed of 20 ft. (poor) in areas of zero gravity while the spacesuit is
      charged. The boosters impart no benefit in areas of high, low, or normal
      gravity.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 30;
