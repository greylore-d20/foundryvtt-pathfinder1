      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>The front of this buckler is fitted with a small, double-barreled gun
      that can be shot while wearing the buckler. Unlike with a double-barreled
      pistol, you can shoot only one barrel at a time. You must remove the
      buckler to reload the gun.</p>

      <p>Each barrel of a buckler gun uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black
      powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. Because of its
      awkward construction, a buckler gun is always considered an off-handed
      weapon.</p>
