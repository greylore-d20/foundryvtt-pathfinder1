    value: >-
      <p>You utter a dire portent, causing destiny and fate to unravel around
      the target. This profoundly disturbing effect causes the target to suffer
      a cumulative -2 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, saving
      throws, and skill checks for every hero point it possesses. The target can
      reduce this penalty by spending hero points normally, but it takes 2d6
      points of damage for each hero point spent while this spell is in
      effect.</p>
