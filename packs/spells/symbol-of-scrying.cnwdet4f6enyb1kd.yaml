      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except that, when triggered, it creates a <em>scrying</em> sensor linked
      to you and centered on the symbol, even if you are on a different plane
      than the symbol. You are immediately aware that the symbol has been
      triggered if you are conscious, and are awakened from normal sleep if
      sleeping. The symbol does not otherwise disturb your concentration. You
      may observe the area through the symbol as if using a <em>scrying</em>
      spell with the sensor as the target creature. Once triggered, the symbol
      remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p>Unlike <em>symbol of
      death</em>, a symbol of <em>scrying</em> is not considered a magical trap.
      Symbol of <em>scrying</em> can be made permanent with a
      <em>permanency</em> spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost
      of 10,000 gp.</p>
