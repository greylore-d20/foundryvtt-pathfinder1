      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This spearlike weapon is about 15 feet long.
      Its unwieldy length is counterbalanced by a heavy brass base. A sarissa
      provides extended reach-tripling your reach rather than doubling it. A
      Medium wielder would threaten spaces 10 to 15 feet away, but not adjacent
      squares or squares 5 to 10 feet away (as with a typical reach weapon).
      Because of its great length and weight, a sarissa can be used to attack
      foes in only one direction each round. You must select a cone each round
      before you make any attacks with the sarissa. The weapon threatens only
      foes within this cone and within its extended reach. You can't change the
      area you threaten with the sarissa until your next turn. While you carry
      the sarissa pointed upward (typical for overland movement), you threaten
      only squares in the sarissa's reach in a cone pointed upward.</p>
