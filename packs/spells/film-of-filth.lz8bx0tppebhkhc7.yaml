      <p>You cause the target's flesh to exude a layer of putrescent slime so
      foul that the target is sickened (Fortitude negates) for the duration of
      the spell and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. All creatures within 20 feet also
      become sickened (Fortitude negates), and remain sickened for as long as
      they remain within 20 feet of the target and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A
      creature that strikes the target with a bite attack must succeed at an
      additional save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. Creatures immune to
      poison are unaffected.</p>
