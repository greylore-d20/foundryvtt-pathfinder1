      <p>This spell causes any existing wounds that the target possesses to
      bleed profusely. If the creature's current total hit points are less than
      its maximum, this spell causes the creature to take 1 point of bleed
      damage each round and become exhausted for the duration of the spell. A
      successful DC 15 Heal check or any spell that cures hit point damage
      negates the effects of this spell.</p>
