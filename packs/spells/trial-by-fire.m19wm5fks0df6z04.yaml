  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You test a creature's purity of convictions by exposing it to a sheet
      of divine fire. Unless the target's alignment is within one step of your
      deity's, the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum
      5d6 points of damage). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half
      results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being
      reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. Additionally, if the target
      has an element of its alignment that is in direct opposition to your
      (chaos opposes law and evil opposes good), you can also attempt an
      Intimidate check to demoralize the target as a free action.</p>
