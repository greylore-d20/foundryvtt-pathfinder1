      "value": "<p>When you take this revelation, choose one element: air, earth, fire, or water. You can conjure an enveloping, protective force made of this element that grants you a +4 armor bonus to AC (this manifests as a solid rush of air over your body, rocky plates covering your skin, and the like).</p>\n<p>At 7th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2.</p>\n<p>You can use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.</p>\n<p>At 13th level, you receive an additional boon depending on the element you chose. If you chose air, you gain a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws. If you chose earth, you gain a +2 bonus to CMD. If you chose fire, you gain fire resistance 2 (this stacks with any other fire resistance you have). If you chose water, you gain a +4 bonus on Swim checks.</p>"
