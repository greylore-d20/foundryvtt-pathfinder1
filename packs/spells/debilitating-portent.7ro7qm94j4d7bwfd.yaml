  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target is surrounded by a glowing green aura of ill fate. Each time
      the spell's subject makes an attack or casts a spell, it must succeed at a
      Will saving throw with a DC = 10 + 1/2 caster level + Charisma (in the
      case of oracles), Intelligence (in the case of witches), or Wisdom (in the
      case of clerics). If it fails the saving throw, it deals half damage with
      the attack or spell. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action
      when the target confirms a critical hit; doing so negates the critical
      hit. The attack that you negated still hits, but only deals half
      damage.</p>
