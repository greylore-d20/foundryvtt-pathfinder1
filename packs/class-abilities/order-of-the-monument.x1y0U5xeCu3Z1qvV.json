He must adhere to the settlement’s laws even while away from its borders and promote its populace’s overarching ideals and values whenever possible.<p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever an order of the monument cavalier issues a challenge, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of his challenge when the cavalier is flanked, as well as a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has.<p><b>Skills:</b> An order of the monument cavalier adds Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (religion) to his list of class skills.
