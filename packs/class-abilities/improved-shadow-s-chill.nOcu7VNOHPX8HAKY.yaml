    value: >-
      <p>When a character with this talent hits a creature with a melee weapon
      that deals sneak attack damage, the sneak attack damage is cold damage.
      Normal weapon damage is unaffected. The character must have cold
      resistance from a racial trait and the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.ceP00yPUS5Kqs1LR]{shadowâ€™s
      chill} talent before choosing this talent.</p>
