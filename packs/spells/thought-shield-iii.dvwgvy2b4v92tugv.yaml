      <p>This functions as <i>thought shield I</i>, but the circumstance bonus
      on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects increases to +8. In
      addition, any creature that tries to read your thoughts while this spell
      lasts must succeed at a Will save or be stunned for 1 round. This spell
      can be undercast.</p>
