      charge</p><h3>Description</h3><p>An emergency beacon is a small,
      pod-shaped device that emits a bright red flash from a dome on its top
      once every 6 seconds when activated. The beacon also transmits its
      location. Any device capable of receiving signals of any sort can pick up
      a beacon's signal, which can then be tracked back to the source with a
      successful DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) or Survival check. A beacon's
      transmissions have a range of 100 miles over flat terrain, but this range
      is halved in forests or hills, and quartered in mountainous terrain or
      through water.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 25;
