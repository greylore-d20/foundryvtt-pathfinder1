      "value": "<p>As an immediate action whenever the vigilante is grappling a creature and is targeted by an attack, he can attempt a combat maneuver check against the target of his grapple (this combat maneuver check doesn’t count as a grapple combat maneuver check). If he succeeds, the creature he is grappling becomes the new target of the attack. If the check fails, the creature escapes the grapple and the vigilante is the target of the attack as normal.</p>\n<p>This ability must be used after the attack is declared against the vigilante, but before the attack is made and the results revealed.</p>"
