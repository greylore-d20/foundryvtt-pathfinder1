        <p>An anarchic weapon is infused with the power of chaos. It makes the
        weapon chaotically aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage
        reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures
        of lawful alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level (Core
        Rulebook 562) on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The
        negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears
        when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be
        overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is
        wielded.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, you can give a weapon touched the anarchic special weapon
      quality for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level. You can use
      this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for
      every four levels beyond 8th.</p>
