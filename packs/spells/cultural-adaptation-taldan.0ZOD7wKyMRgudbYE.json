    "shortDescription": "<p>When casting this spell, you must concentrate on the culture to which you wish to adapt. If you speak the native language of the culture in question, then for the duration of this spell, you speak the language with a native accent. The spell does not teach you the language in question, but may be combined with tongues or a similar spell. Your body language and gestures mark you as a native of the culture, and you unconsciously make small decisions that help you blend in. These combined new traits give you a +2 on @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.uB9Fy36RUjibxqvt]{Diplomacy} checks made to influence members of the culture to which you have adapted. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.xg25z3GIpS590NDW]{Disguise} checks made to pass yourself off as a member of the culture. Additionally, the DCs of enchantment (charm) spells you cast against natives of the culture to which you are attuned increase by +1.</p><p><em>Editor's Note:</em> Further setting information of the spell can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Humans of Golarion.</em></p>"
