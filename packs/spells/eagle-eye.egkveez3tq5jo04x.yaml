      <p><i>Eagle eye</i> creates a magical sensor directly above you. The
      sensor can appear anywhere above you, to a maximum height equal to the
      spell's range. You can see from this vantage as if you were actually
      there, rotating your viewpoint 360 degrees.</p><p>You perceive with your
      normal visual senses. A caster using <i>eagle eye</i> can easily see for a
      considerable distance. The spell does not penetrate any solid surface,
      although it is unaffected by foliage and the like.</p>
