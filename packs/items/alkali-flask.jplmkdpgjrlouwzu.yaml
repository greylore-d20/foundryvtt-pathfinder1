  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This flask of caustic liquid reacts with an <em>ooze's natural</em>
      acids. You can throw an alkali flask as a <em>splash weapon</em> with a
      range increment of 10 feet. Against non-ooze creatures, an alkali flask
      functions as a normal flask of acid. Against <em>oozes</em> and other
      acid-based creatures, the alkali flask inflicts double damage.</p>
