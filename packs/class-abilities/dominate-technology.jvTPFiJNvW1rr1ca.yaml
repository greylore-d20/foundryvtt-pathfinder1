    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, you can meld your mind with a piece of technology and
      temporarily control it, even if you had no hand in creating it or anything
      like it. Once per day, you can target one construct with
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.cqjtlth3uqafuwnn]{Control Construct} (as per the
      spell), except the DC of the Spellcraft check each round to maintain
      control of the construct is equal to 15 + the construct’s HD.</p>

      <p>If you must attempt opposed Spellcraft checks against the construct’s
      creator, you take a –5 penalty on your Spellcraft checks while you
      concentrate on this ability.</p>
