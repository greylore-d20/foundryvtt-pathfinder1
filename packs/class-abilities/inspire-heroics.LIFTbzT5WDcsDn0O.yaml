  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A bard of 15th level or higher can inspire tremendous heroism in
      himself or a single ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the
      character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional
      creature. To inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and
      hear the bard. Inspired creatures gain a +4 <em>morale bonus</em> on
      saving throws and a +4 <em>dodge bonus</em> to AC. The effect lasts for as
      long as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire heroics
      is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and visual
      components.</p>
