  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An object you touch emanates a 20-foot radius of bright light. The
      effect looks like a regular flame but creates no heat and uses no oxygen.
      Allies within the area of this light gain a +2 enhancement bonus on
      Perception and Sense Motive checks, as well as on Knowledge checks to
      identify monsters that are also within the area and their special powers
      and vulnerabilities.  When an inquisitor casts this spell, the light
      emanation doubles (40-ft.-radius emanation) while that inquisitor has a
      judgment active.  Light spells counter and dispel darkness spells of an
      equal or lower level.</p>
