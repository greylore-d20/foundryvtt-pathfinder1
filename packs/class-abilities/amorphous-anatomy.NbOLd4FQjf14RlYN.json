You gain <em>immunity</em> to critical hits and <em>sneak attacks</em>. In addition, you gain <em>blindsight</em> with a range of 60 feet and <em>damage reduction</em> 5/â€”. You automatically recover from physical blindness or deafness after 1 round by growing new sensory organs to replace the compromised ones; you cannot otherwise regenerate lost body parts.</p>"
