If the barbarian deals more damage than the floor’s hardness, the space she occupies and all of the squares adjacent to her become difficult terrain. Creatures in those squares, except the barbarian, must succeed at DC 15 Reflex saves or be knocked prone.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>"
