    value: >-
      <p>You overstimulate the senses of the affected creature, causing its
      senses to interfere with another. While a creature is under the effects of
      this spell, sensory input is processed by the wrong  senses, such that
      noise triggers bursts of colors, smells create sounds, and so on. The
      affected creature moves at half speed, has a 20% miss chance on attacks,
      and takes a -4 penalty to AC and on skill checks and Reflex saves.
      Successful spellcasting while affected requires a concentration check with
      a DC equal to this spell's save DC plus the level of spell being cast.  In
      addition, the affected creature is considered distracted for the purpose
      of attempting Perception checks. Effects that negate or reduce concealment
      do not affect the miss chance from <i>synesthesia</i>.</p>
