    value: >-
      <p>You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6
      points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each
      creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.</p><p>The
      <i>lightning bolt</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its
      path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold,
      copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier
      shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if
      the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any
      other spell effect does.</p>
