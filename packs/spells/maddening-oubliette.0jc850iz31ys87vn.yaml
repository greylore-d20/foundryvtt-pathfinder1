      <p>The target is transported to a dark and dank prison in some unspecified
      horrific demiplane, where tentacles writhe around, clawed fingers grab at
      the creature (though they deal no damage), and harsh, whispering voices
      speak blasphemies and maddening secrets. At the end of each round within
      this terrifying oubliette, the target can attempt a Will saving throw in
      order to escape the prison. The saving throw has a penalty equal to the
      number of rounds the target has spent in the oubliette (minimum -1 and
      maximum -5). If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it returns to its
      former space. If that space is occupied or otherwise unavailable, the
      target is shunted to the nearest available space. When the target returns
      from the oubliette, it is confused for a number of rounds equal to the
      number of rounds of imprisonment (minimum 1), unless it was confined in
      the oubliette for 10 or more rounds, in which case the target is affected
      as if it were subject to an <i>insanity</i> spell instead.</p>
