      <p>You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the
      area. The <i>shifting sand</i> obliterates tracks and is considered
      difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to
      your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their
      turn in the <i>shifting sand</i> must make a Reflex save each round or
      become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt
      to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall
      prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply
      it as a bonus on their saving throws.</p><p>As a move action, you may move
      the area of <i>shifting sand</i> up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures
      that are entangled or prone in the spell's area are carried along with the
      <i>shifting sand</i> in the same direction if possible. This movement does
      not provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects
      may also be carried along or shallowly buried by the <i>shifting
      sand</i>.</p>
