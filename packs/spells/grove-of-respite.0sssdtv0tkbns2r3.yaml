  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a sheltered grove of trees surrounding a shallow spring.
      The grove appears from nowhere even in the most barren, rocky soil
      regardless of season, but the spell must be cast outside on open
      ground.</p><p>The area within the grove is temperate and comfortable, like
      that of a <i>tiny hut</i>, although the grove provides no illumination and
      provides no protection from the elements. The water in the grove's spring
      is clean and drinkable. Additionally, the trees provide a variety of ripe
      fruit, regardless of season, which acts as a <i>goodberry</i> spell for up
      to eight people. The grove is warded with an <i>alarm</i> spell that
      alerts you whenever any creature enters the area. Once the spell expires,
      the grove vanishes, including all fruit, water, and other materials from
      it, although any nourishment or healing gained from its effects
      remains.</p>
