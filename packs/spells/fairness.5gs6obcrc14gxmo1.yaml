  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Humanoid creatures affected by this spell must trade fairly with others
      to the best of their knowledge. If they know the fair value (or even an
      estimated fair value) of a good or service, they cannot participate in a
      trade if it would benefit one side unfairly, and must attempt to stop such
      trades from occurring, preventing them from cheating another while under
      the influence of this spell. The symbol of Abadar appears above the heads
      of those affected by this spell, making those affected and unaffected by
      the spell immediately apparent.</p>
