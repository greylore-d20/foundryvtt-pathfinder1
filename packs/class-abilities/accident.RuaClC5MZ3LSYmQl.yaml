  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes a target within 30 feet to stumble and fall. The
      shaman attempts a caster level check with a DC equal to the target’s CMD
      against trip attempts. On a successful check, the target falls prone and
      takes 1d6 points of damage. If the target is adjacent to a pit or similar
      drop-off, he must also succeed at a Reflex save (with a DC equal to the
      shaman’s caster level check) or fall into the pit. Observers must succeed
      at a Perception or Sense Motive check with a DC equal to the shaman’s
      caster level check to identify her as the source of the accident.</p>
