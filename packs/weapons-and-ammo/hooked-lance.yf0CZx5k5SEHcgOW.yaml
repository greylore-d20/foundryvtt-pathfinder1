  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This slender, 10-foot-long polearm has an added hook protruding from
      the head that is used to snag the clothing and armor of opponents. A
      hooked lance, unlike a lance, can't be wielded in one hand while mounted
      and doesn't deal extra damage if used while mounted.</p>
