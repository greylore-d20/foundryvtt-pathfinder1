      <p>At 1st level, you gain @Compendium[pf1.spells.uqh87jz757r2cb7r]{Detect
      Magic} and @Compendium[pf1.spells.j0bc0iii8zp1jiwr]{Read Magic} as spells
      known. At 5th level, the <em>phoenixâ€™s</em> blood drives you to find and
      save lost knowledge and magical items. As a <em>swift action</em>, you can
      automatically identify the properties of a non-cursed magic item you hold;
      you must still identify a cursed item as normal to correctly
      <em>identify</em> it as cursed. You can use this ability a number of times
      equal to your <em>Charisma</em> modifier per day.</p>
