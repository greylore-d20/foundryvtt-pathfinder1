  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Knock</i> opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those
      subject to <i>hold portal or arcane lock</i>. When you complete the
      casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the
      lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, <i>knock</i> opens up to two means
      of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or
      trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains
      (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an <i>arcane
      locked</i> door, the spell does not remove the <i>arcane lock</i> but
      simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes.</p><p>In all other cases,
      the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.
      <i>Knock</i> does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a
      portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is
      limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of
      preventing access.</p>
