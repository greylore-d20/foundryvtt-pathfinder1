      <h3>Description</h3><p>A handful of pellets, along with 1 dose of black
      powder, is commonly used as ammunition for one-handed and twohanded
      firearms with the scatter weapon quality, though rocks or other small bits
      of hard material can be used in the pellets' place. Using anything other
      than pellets or alchemical cartridges when firing off a cone attack with a
      scatter weapon increases the weapon's misfire range by 1 (though this
      increase can be removed by switching back to standard ammunition). Thirty
      handfuls of pellets weigh half a pound.</p>
