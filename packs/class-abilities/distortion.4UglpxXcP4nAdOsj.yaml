  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The implement allows its bearer to distort his form and location,
      protecting him from harm. As a standard action, the bearer can gain a
      concealment miss chance equal to 5% for every point of mental focus
      invested in the implement (to a maximum of 5% + 5% for every 2 occultist
      levels you possess) until the next time the bearer makes an attack. If
      this miss chance reaches 50%, it doesnâ€™t increase further, but the bearer
      gains all the benefits of invisibility. Creatures with see invisibility,
      true seeing, or similar abilities ignore the miss chance from this
      ability.</p>
