  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, while wielding a light or one-handed piercing melee
      weapon in one hand, the swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to take the
      fighting defensively action as a swift action instead of a standard
      action. When fighting defensively in this manner, the dodge bonus to AC
      gained from that action increases to +4, and the penalty to attack rolls
      is reduced to -2.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
      <em>Panache</em> class feature</p>
