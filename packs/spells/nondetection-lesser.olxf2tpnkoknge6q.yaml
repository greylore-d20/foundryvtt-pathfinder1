      <p>This spell functions like <i>nondetection</i>, except it blocks the
      effects of only divination spells and effects that target an area, rather
      than you or an object in your possession specifically. For example, lesser
      <i>nondetection</i> doesn't ward you against a spellcaster who is
      attempting to scry on you with the <i>scrying</i> spell or find an object
      in your possession with <i>locate object</i>, but it does protect  you
      against effects that target an area you happen to be in, such as detect
      spells or <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>.</p>
