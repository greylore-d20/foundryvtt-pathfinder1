    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, as a <em>swift action</em> once per day, you can take 2
      points of temporary <em>ability damage</em> to one of your ability scores
      and add a temporary +2 inherent bonus to any other ability score. This
      bonus lasts for a maximum of 1 hour per <em>sorcerer</em> level or until
      you choose to prematurely dismiss it (a <em>free action</em>), during
      which time the temporary <em>ability damage</em> cannot be healed by any
      means. After this effect ends, you can heal the <em>ability damage</em>
      normally.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>At 20th level, you can use this ability twice per day.</li>
