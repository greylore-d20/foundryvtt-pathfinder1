      <p>At 8th level, once per day, you can speak a word of anathema against a
      single creature within 60 feet (Will negates). This acts as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.lsboosfk26m0ycqv]{Bestow Curse} and lasts for 1
      minute, giving the target a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability
      checks, and skill checks.</p>
