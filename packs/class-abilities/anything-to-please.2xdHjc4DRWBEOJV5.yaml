  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can compel a creature within 30 feet to attempt to
      please you as a standard action. The creature receives a Will save to
      negate this affect. If the save fails, the creature attacks your enemies
      for 1 round, gives you its most valuable item, or drops prone at your feet
      and grovels for 1d4 rounds (GMâ€™s choice). You can use this ability once
      per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every four levels
      beyond 8th. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Charming Smile power of the Charm Domain.</p>
