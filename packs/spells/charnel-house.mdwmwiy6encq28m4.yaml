  shortDescription: >-
    <p>By sacrificing a living creature, you create the grisly illusion of
    viscera and gore splattered about the nearby area. When the casting time is
    complete, the walls drip with blood and the floor is slick with
    unidentifiable lumps of meat and other signs of a massacre. Anyone entering
    the area must attempt a Will save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. This is a
    mind-affecting effect. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can see the
    semi-real nature of the illusion.  The room itself is covered in a layer of
    slippery, semi-real gore. Any creature attempting to walk within or through
    the area of gore can move at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics
    check. Failure means it can't move that round, and failure by 5 or more
    means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that
    don't move on their turns don't need to attempt this check and are not
    considered flat-footed. A creature that succeeded at its Will save gains a
    +5 bonus on the Acrobatics check.</p>
