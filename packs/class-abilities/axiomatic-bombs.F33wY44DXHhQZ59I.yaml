    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal lawful
      divine damage. Chaotic creatures that take a direct hit from an axiomatic
      bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn.
      Against neutral creatures, axiomatic bombs deal half damage, and such
      targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Axiomatic bombs have
      no effect on lawful creatures.</p><p>An alchemist must be at least 8th
      level before selecting this discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>:
      link charges to <em>bomb</em> class feature</p>
