    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, you gain Reach Spell as a bonus feat. Additionally, when
      using this feat, you can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool for each
      increase in the spellâ€™s range category. If you do, the spell does not use
      up a higher-level spell slot than normal. (For example, a spell with a
      range of touch increased to long range via this feat would normally use up
      a spell slot 3 levels higher, but if you spend 3 points from your phrenic
      pool, the spell does not use up a higher spell slot.)</p>
