  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You fling an object weighing up to 5 pounds at the target. You must
      succeed at a ranged attack (not a ranged touch attack) to hit your target;
      if you hit, you deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to both the target
      and the object. The type of object thrown doesn't change the damage type
      or any other properties of the attack, even if you throw a weapon or magic
      item in this way.</p>
