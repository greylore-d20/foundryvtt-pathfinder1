    value: >-
      <p>You create an extradimensional link between yourself and one summoned
      creature you control that allows you to switch places. After casting
      master's escape, you can teleport to your summoned creature's space as a
      swift action, causing your summoned creature to teleport to your former
      space. If your summoned creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points
      before you can use this spell's effect, you can teleport to a space that
      you can see within 30 feet as an immediate action. After using either of
      these effects, the spell ends. A summoner can target his eidolon with this
      spell.</p>
