  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The character can store within himself a single targeted harmless spell
      of up to 2nd level. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard
      action. Anytime a spell that meets these conditions is cast on the rogue,
      and he does not already have a spell stored, he can choose to store it
      rather than have it take effect immediately. Anytime afterward, as a
      standard action, the character can have the spell take effect (acting in
      all ways as if it had just been cast on him). A character must have 1 rank
      of Use Magic Device to select this talent.</p>
