  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell augments your diplomacies. While under the effects of spell,
      you roll two dice each time you make a Diplomacy check to change a
      creature's attitude, taking the highest roll.</p><p>If this results in a
      roll low enough to reduce the creature's attitude by a step, that creature
      gets some clue that you are manipulating it with a spell. Alternatively
      you can cast this spell before making a Diplomacy check to gather
      information, gaining a +5 competence bonus on the check.</p>
