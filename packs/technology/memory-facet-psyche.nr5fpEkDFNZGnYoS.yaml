      <p>A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb.
      This potent device is used to store programming meant to augment or change
      an AI's functional nature. Full rules for memory facets are on page 62 of
      <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #86: Lords of Rust</em>. The memory facets
      detailed below can be found in this adventure.</p><p><strong>Psyche
      Facet</strong>: A psyche facet bolsters a robot's sense of self and
      enhances its ability to resist peril and danger. It grants a +3 resistance
      bonus on all saving throws. In addition, once per day the AI can restore a
      destroyed robot to activity, as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.snrnhiwqet5dmas0]{Memory of Function} , using
      the AI's CR as the effective caster level.</p>
