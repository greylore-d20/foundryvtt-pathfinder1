      <p>At 2nd level, the cavalier receives
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.bZ1YdzkT8NtRIEJ4]{Catch Off-Guard} as a bonus feat.
      As a swift action, he can cause an armed opponent to become flat-footed
      against any attacks he makes during that round with an improvised weapon.
      This ability can be used once per combat.</p>
