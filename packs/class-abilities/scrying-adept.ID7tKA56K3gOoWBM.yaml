      <p>At 8th level, you are always aware when you are being observed via
      magic, as if you had a permanent
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.viq93vkjaungdbul]{Detect Scrying}. In addition,
      whenever you scry on a subject, treat the subject as one step more
      familiar to you. Very familiar subjects get a â€“10 penalty on their save to
      avoid your scrying attempts.</p>
