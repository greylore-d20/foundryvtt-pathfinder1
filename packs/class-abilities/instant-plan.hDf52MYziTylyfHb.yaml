  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante can quickly manage a situation that seems to be spiraling
      out of control. Once per day, the vigilante can state a plan of action.
      All allies within 30 feet that can hear him gain a +2 morale bonus on
      saving throws against fear effects and are immune to being demoralized.
      They also gain a +1 morale bonus on skill checks or combat maneuver checks
      of the vigilanteâ€™s choice. The benefits last for 1 round per vigilante
      level.</p>
