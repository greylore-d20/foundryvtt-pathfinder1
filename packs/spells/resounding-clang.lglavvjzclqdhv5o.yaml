  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a loud, resonating clangor that causes metallic objects to
    vibrate wildly. Affected creatures wielding metal weapons take a -1 penalty
    on attack rolls, while creatures using metallic tools take a -1 penalty on
    associated skill checks.</p><p>Creatures wearing metal armor increase the
    armor check penalty of their armor by 1. These penalties increase by 1 at
    8th caster level and every 4 caster levels thereafter (to a maximum of -4 at
    16th level).</p><p>To be affected by the spell, an item must be composed
    primarily of metal. Nonmetallic objects with metal components (such as
    studded leather armor or padded armor with armor spikes) are not affected.
    Creatures made of metal take the penalties described above on attack rolls,
    damage rolls, skill checks, and Reflex saves.</p>
