  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic’s mind-affecting
      spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome
      an undead creature’s immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes
      of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but
      has no effect on creatures that aren’t undead.</p>

      <p>This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the
      mind-affecting descriptor.</p>
