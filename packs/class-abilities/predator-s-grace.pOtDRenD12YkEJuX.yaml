    value: >-
      <p>You can, as a swift action, grant yourself a +10-foot bonus to your
      base speed for 1 round. This bonus increases by 5 feet for every 5 cleric
      levels you possess. In addition, you gain low-light vision for 1 round. If
      you already possess low-light vision, the range of your sight becomes
      three times that of a human in dim light for 1 round. You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
