  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Also known as "alchemist's ice," this sealed jar of crystalline blue
      fluid immediately starts to evaporate once opened. During the next 1d6
      rounds, you can use it to freeze a liquid or to coat an object in a thin
      layer of ice. You can also throw liquid ice as a <em>splash weapon</em>. A
      direct hit deals 1d6 points of cold damage; creatures within 5 feet of
      where it hits take 1 point of cold damage from the
      splash.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (alchemy)</strong> DC
