    value: >-
      <p>As a full-round action, the character can move up to her speed. If she
      successfully reaches a location that offers her cover or concealment, any
      creature observing her must attempt a Perception check opposed by the
      characterâ€™s Stealth check. On a failed check, the observer loses track of the
      character and fails to note where she moved to. The rogue does not take a
      penalty on this Stealth check for moving up to her speed. At the end of
      her movement, the rogue can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all
      foes within 60 feet who were aware of her at any point during her movement
      and are unaware of her current location. She rolls the Intimidate check
      only once and compares her result to the DC for each opponent. The rogue
      must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</p>
