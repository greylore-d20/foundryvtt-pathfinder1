  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The rulers of Azlant are thought to have used this spell to amplify the
    mythic power of themselves and their most gifted lieutenants. You amplify
    the mythic power of the target creatures, bolstering them with healing
    energy each time they draw upon their mythic abilities. When a creature
    affected by this spell expends uses of mythic power for any ability, it
    immediately heals 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
    +25). In addition, the creature benefits from one of the following
    additional effects.</p><p><ul><li> Remove any one of the following
    conditions: dazzled, fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered.</p><p><li>
    Reduce the dazed or stunned condition to staggered.</p><p><li> Reduce the
    exhausted condition to fatigued.</p><p><li> Reduce the frightened condition
    to shaken, or the panicked condition to frightened.</p><p><li> Reduce the
    nauseated condition to sickened.</ul></p><p>A target can benefit from the
    effects of <i>sustaining legend</i> only once per round, even if the target
    expends multiple uses of mythic power during that time.</p>
