      "value": "<p><strong>Element&nbsp;</strong>aether;&nbsp;<strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;defense (Su);&nbsp;<strong>Level</strong>&nbsp;—;&nbsp;<strong>Burn&nbsp;</strong>0</p>\n<p>You constantly surround yourself with a ward of force. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your kineticist level. You always lose these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points. If an attack deals less damage than you still have as temporary hit points from force ward, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. These temporary hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute.</p>\n<p>By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, you can increase the maximum number of temporary hit points provided by your force ward by half your kineticist level until the next time your burn is removed. If you use this ability multiple times, the increases stack. For every 2 points of burn you accept in this way, your force ward’s rate of regeneration increases by 1 hit point per minute.</p>\n<p>Whenever you accept burn while using an aether wild talent, you siphon some of the energy from the aether flowing through you and your force ward recovers a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level, up to its current maximum. You can dismiss or restore your force ward as an immediate action, but doing so doesn’t change the number of temporary hit points available, and the temporary hit points don’t recover while this ability is inactive.</p>"
