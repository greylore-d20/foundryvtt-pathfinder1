  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon comprises a pair of kama connected with an 8-foot length of
      chain. The wielder can attack as if armed with a single kama in each hand
      or extend the chain to make a single reach attack. By swinging the chain,
      the wielder can whip the kama about to disarm or trip opponents.
      Furthermore, if one of the weapons is dropped, the wielder can retrieve it
      as a free action by pulling on the chain.</p>
