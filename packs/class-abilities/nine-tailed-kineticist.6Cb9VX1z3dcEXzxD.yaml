      <p><strong>Element</strong> universal; <strong>Type</strong> utility (Su);
      <strong>Level</strong> 1; <strong>Burn</strong> 0<br
      /><strong>Prerequisite</strong> kitsune</p><p>You can cast a spell-like
      ability granted to you by any
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.fnAVlh0TXLt5XbNJ]{Magical Tail} feat you
      have by accepting 1 point of burn, even if you have no daily uses of that
      spell-like ability remaining. You must be able to use wild talents of a
      level equal to the number of extra tails required to use a spell-like
      ability granted by a <em>Magical Tail</em> feat to use this ability to
      cast that spell-like ability (for example, you would need to be 15th level
      and able to use 8th-level wild talents to use this talent to cast the
      dominate person spell-like ability granted by Magical Tail).</p><p>In
      addition, you can learn a <em>Magical Tail</em> feat that you qualify for
      in place of gaining a new infusion or utility wild talent.</p>
