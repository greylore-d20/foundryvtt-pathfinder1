  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, you become an avatar of the primal worldâ€”part
      humanoid, part beast. Once per day, you can transform into a lycanthrope
      of your choice for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier,
      gaining all the powers of a natural lycanthrope of that type, including
      the ability to change shape between human, animal, and hybrid form. In
      addition, you become immune to mind-affecting and language-dependent
      effects, as well as effects that specifically target only humanoids.</p>
