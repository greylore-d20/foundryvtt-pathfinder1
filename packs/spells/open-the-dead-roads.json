    "shortDescription": "<p>To cast <i>open the</i> <i>Dead Roads</i>, you must be in an area of fog or dim light. Upon completion of the spell, swirling mists part and deposit you and any creatures you touched on a nearby stretch of the <i>Dead Roads</i>, a network of extraplanar roadways. You can take up to one creature per level, but all targets must be touching each other. You must specify a location known to you or one of your travelers as your destination when casting this spell.  When traveling the otherworldly paths of the <i>Dead Roads</i>, you move at a speed of 50 miles per hour regardless of the terrain on the Material Plane. Your own movement speed does not change; you simply arrive at distant destinations more quickly because the <i>Dead Roads</i> offer a shorter route. You can exit the <i>Dead Roads</i> at any point before reaching your destination by wandering off the path, in which case you are usually returned to your starting place. If this would place  you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available.</p><p>Because the <i>Dead Roads</i> occupy another plane, it is impossible to spy on the Material Plane while using this spell without additional spells or supernatural abilities.</p><p><i>Open the</i> <i>Dead Roads</i> can be used to travel to or from the Shadow Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Plane, or the Boneyard; any of these destinations requires 10 hours of travel. Thanks to their unique nature, the <i>Dead Roads</i> can be used to travel from any plane to the Material Plane-a trip likewise requiring 10 hours-unless that plane normally bars all extraplanar travel.</p><p>Creatures you bring with you to the <i>Dead Roads</i> are not obligated to follow you. If they wander off, there is an 80% chance they arrive at a random point on the Material Plane within 2d6x10 miles of your starting point, otherwise they arrive in the Boneyard.</p>"
