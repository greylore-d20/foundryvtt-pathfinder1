  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a <em>standard action</em>, you cast a weave of shadows at any foe
      within 30 feet as a ranged <em>touch attack</em>. The shadows
      <em>entangle</em> your foe for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every
      five wizard levels you possess. In conditions of bright light, this
      duration is halved (minimum 1 round). A creature <em>entangled</em> by
      your shadows has <em>concealment</em> from those without
      <em>darkvision</em> or the ability to see in darkness, and other creatures
      likewise have <em>concealment</em> relative to it. You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Intelligence</em>
      modifier.</p>
