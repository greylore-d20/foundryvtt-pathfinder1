  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, you develop a deeper attachment to your lingering
      spirits, and learn to rely on their presence as protection from external
      spiritual attacks. You gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on
      saving throws against effects generated by haunts, incorporeal undead,
      incorporeal outsiders, and on saving throws against possession
      attempts.</p>
