    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, the cavalier can declare a blaze of glory as a standard
      action. For a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier, the
      cavalier increases his base speed by 10 feet, can ignore difficult terrain
      while charging, and gains a +4 bonus on his attack rolls (instead of +2).
      A cavalier can use this ability only once per combat.</p>
