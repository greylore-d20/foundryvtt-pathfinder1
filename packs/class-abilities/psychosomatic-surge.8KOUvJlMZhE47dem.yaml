  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily.
      The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The
      subject gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + 1/2 the
      mesmeristâ€™s level. If the damage from the triggering attack would have
      reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an
      additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1
      hour or until discharged.</p>
