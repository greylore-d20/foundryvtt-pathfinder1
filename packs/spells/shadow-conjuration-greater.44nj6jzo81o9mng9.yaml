      <p>This spell functions like <i>shadow conjuration,</i> except that it
      duplicates any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration
      (creation) spell of 6th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created
      deal three-fifths (60%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects
      are 60% likely to work against nonbelievers.</p>
