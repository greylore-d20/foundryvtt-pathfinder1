It destroys most normal adhesives (such as tar, tree sap, or glue) in a single round but takes 1d4+1 rounds to deal with more powerful adhesives (alchemical glue, tanglefoot bags, spider webbing, and so on). It has no affect on fully magical adhesives, such as sovereign glue.</p>\r\n<p><b>Create</b>: <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a> (alchemy) DC 20</p>\r\n"
