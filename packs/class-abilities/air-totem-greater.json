Creatures attempting to cast spells while adjacent to the barbarian must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level), and ranged attack rolls against the barbarian take a –4 penalty. Creatures smaller than the barbarian that attack the barbarian in melee with a natural weapon or touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier) or the attack fails and the creature is flung back 5 feet and knocked prone. The barbarian can suspend this aura as a free action.</p>"
