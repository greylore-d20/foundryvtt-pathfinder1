      <p>This spell functions like <i>fireball</i>, except that it is more
      powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The
      burst of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum
      20d6). The glowing bead created by <i>delayed blast fireball</i> can
      detonate immediately if you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst
      for as many as 5 rounds. You select the amount of delay upon completing
      the spell, and that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone
      touches the bead. If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its
      destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead
      as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and
      moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance
      that the bead detonates while being handled.</p>
