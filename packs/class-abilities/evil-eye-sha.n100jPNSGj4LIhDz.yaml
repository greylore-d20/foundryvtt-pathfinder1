    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes doubt to creep into the mind of a foe within 30 feet
      that she can see. The target takes a –2 penalty on one of the following
      (shaman’s choice): ability checks, AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or
      skill checks. This hex lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shaman’s
      Wisdom modifier. A successful Will saving throw reduces this to just 1
      round.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the penalty increases to –4. This is a mind-affecting
      effect.</p>
