    "shortDescription": "<p>A 1-inch-thick slab of stone springs up from the ground, interposing itself between you and an opponent of your choice. The <i>stone shield</i> provides you with cover from that enemy (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 195) until the beginning of your next turn, granting you a +4 bonus to Armor Class and a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws. If the opponent's attack misses you by 4 or less, the attack strikes the shield instead. The <i>stone shield</i> has hardness 8 and 15 hit points. If the shield is destroyed, the spell ends and the shield crumbles away into nothingness. Spells and effects that damage an area deal damage to the shield.  You cannot use this spell if you are not adjacent to a large area of earth or stone such as the ground or a wall. At 4th level, a qinggong monk (<i>Ultimate</i> Magic) may select this spell as a ki power costing 1 ki point to activate.</p>",
