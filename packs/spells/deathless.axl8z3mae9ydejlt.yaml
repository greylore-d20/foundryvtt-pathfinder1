    value: >-
      <p>The target's soul is strongly anchored to its body, preventing death
      from hit point damage. No matter how low the target's hit points get, it
      remains alive (though not necessarily conscious).  This spell doesn't
      prevent death from sources other than hit point damage-such as
      Constitution damage or drain, death effects, or energy drain. Spells that
      cure hit points affect the creature normally.</p>
