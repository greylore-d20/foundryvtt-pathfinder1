    value: >-
      <p>You can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.65i0wc0e6fq0evk5]{detect
      animals or plants} as a spell-like ability at will. You gain a +2 insight
      bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks, and while using detect animals or
      plants, the bonus increases to +4 to identify a matching animal or plant
      creature within the area of effect. At 7th level, you can speak with any
      animal you successfully identify, as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.ct9fhh8uawn8e4md]{speak with animals}, but
      this ability doesnâ€™t make the creature any friendlier than normal.</p>
