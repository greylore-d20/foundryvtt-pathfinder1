  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You temporarily age the target, immediately advancing it to the next
      age category. The target immediately takes the age penalties to Strength,
      Dexterity, and Constitution for its new age category, but does not gain
      the bonuses for that category.</p><p>A creature whose age is unknown is
      treated as if the spell advances it to middle age. Ageless or immortal
      creatures are immune to this spell.</p><p>If you cast this on an object,
      construct, or undead creature, it takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per
      caster level (maximum +15) as time weathers and corrodes it. This version
      of the spell has an instantaneous duration.</p>
