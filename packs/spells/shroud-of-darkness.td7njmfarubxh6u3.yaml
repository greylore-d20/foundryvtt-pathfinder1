    value: >-
      <p>With a dark incantation and a gesture of your hand over your eyes, you
      cause a shroud of <i>darkness</i> to descend upon the targets of this
      spell. The subjects treat the light level as two steps lower than normal
      for the duration of this spell. Bright light becomes dim light, normal
      light becomes <i>darkness</i>, and areas of dim light and <i>darkness</i>
      become supernaturally dark (as <i>darkness</i>, but even creatures with
      darkvision cannot see).</p>
