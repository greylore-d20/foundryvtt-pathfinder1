As a standard action, you can assume the form of a Medium dragon, as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.iqcjiyi9leldfzxt]{Form of the Dragon I}.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you can assume the form of a Large dragon, as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.5icj4nasrlgqojqm]{Form of the Dragon II}.</p>\n<p>At 19th level, you can assume the form of a Huge dragon, as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.6qpg42rj70oi4css]{Form of the Dragon III}.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 10 minutes per oracle level.</p>\n<p>If you are at least 15th level and choose to have this ability function as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.iqcjiyi9leldfzxt]{Form of the Dragon I}, the duration is instead 1 hour per oracle level.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation. Rather than form of the dragon spells, you can choose for this revelation to act as @Compendium[pf1.spells.g3d29t4amz91ewy5]{Form Of The Alien Dragon I}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.k59ax9hxy83o19bn]{Form Of The Alien Dragon II}, and @Compendium[pf1.spells.fv14vemq9gduhyhu]{Form Of The Alien Dragon III} (see page 29) or @Compendium[pf1.spells.tjokidgeh3dy9mv0]{Form Of The Exotic Dragon I}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.gwyeoo4ksso71zfo]{Form Of The Exotic Dragon II}, and @Compendium[pf1.spells.0nm8l17dcr7oi7c3]{Form Of The Exotic Dragon III} (see page 30). This choice must be made when you first gain this revelation, and cannot be changed.</p>"
