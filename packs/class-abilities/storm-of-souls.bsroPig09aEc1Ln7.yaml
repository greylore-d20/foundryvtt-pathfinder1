  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can summon the spirits of your ancestors to attack in a ghostly
      barrageâ€”their fury creates physical wounds on creatures in the area. The
      storm has a range of 100 feet and is a 20-foot-radius burst. Objects and
      creatures in the area take 1d8 hit points of damage for every two oracle
      levels you possess. Undead creatures in the area take 1d8 points of damage
      for every oracle level you possess. A successful Fortitude save reduces
      the damage to half.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
      at 11th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>
