  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You instantly travel between shadows to a point within range, though
      line of sight is not necessary. You leave a shadowy image of yourself in
      your former location and are wrapped in shadow at your destination; you
      can attempt a Stealth check as a free action to hide in your new location.
      Creatures that fail opposed Perception checks typically aren't aware that
      you are no longer at your former location unless they are familiar with
      this spell and identify the effects. Any attack on your former location
      causes the shadows to disperse, allowing any creature that can see your
      former location to immediately notice your disappearance. In addition, for
      1 round, the envelope of shadow around you grants you concealment (20%
      miss chance). This spell doesn't function if there are no shadows within 5
      feet of your starting location, and you can't travel through your own
      shadow. If you choose a destination that has no shadows, you appear from
      the shadow closest to your destination that's within the spell's range
      (this could be your starting location if there are no other shadows within
      the spell's range).</p>
