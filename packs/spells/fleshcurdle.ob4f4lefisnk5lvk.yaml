      <p>You warp the target creature's flesh, discoloring it and causing it to
      become misshapen and impairing its function. When you cast this spell, you
      must choose one of three types of effects to inflict on the
      target-movement, attacks, or defense.</p><p><i>Attacks</i>: One of the
      creature's natural attacks takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls,
      only scores a critical hit on a natural 20, and only deals x2 damage on a
      confirmed critical hit.</p><p><i>Defense</i>: The creature's natural armor
      bonus decreases by -4, to a minimum bonus of +0.</p><p><i>Movement</i>:
      One of the creature's movement speeds (chosen by you) is
      halved.</p><p>Most undead are susceptible to <i>fleshcurdle</i>, but
      amorphous creatures and creatures without flesh are immune (such as
      elementals, oozes, plants, gaseous or incorporeal creatures, and
      skeletons).</p>
