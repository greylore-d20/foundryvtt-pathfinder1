      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Both<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Fey creatures resemble the mundane
      creatures they derive from, but with brighter colors, delicate features,
      and elegant wings such as those of a pixie or sprite. Despite their
      fragile-seeming appearance, fey creatures are every bit as hardy as their
      non-fey relations, though they sacrifice raw might for grace and the
      ability to fly. They live long lives, barring death by misadventure, and
      rarely show outward signs of age.<p>Some fey creatures owe their nature to
      fey ancestors interbreeding with mortal beings, while others are races in
      their own right. Still others began life as ordinary creatures and were
      infused with fey essence through the magic of learned spellcasters or the
      influence of ancient powers of nature. As a rule, fey creatures rarely
      dwell in civilized lands, both by preference and because the conditions
      that give rise to the fey rarely occur in urban surroundings. If not
      already born into realms of primeval wild or areas touched by great fey
      powers, fey creatures soon seek them out.<p>Though more prone to mischief
      than mayhem, fey creatures run the gamut from inimical to sprightly in
      behavior. Those inclined toward play and jest take a dim view of
      interlopers lacking in good humor. Such foul-tempered intruders risk
      humiliation at best if they insult the fey, and much worse if they raise
      arms against them. More aggressive fey still possess a well-developed
      though sadistic sense of humor. Such wicked fey use their inborn powers to
      lure outsiders to their doom, rather than into mere inconvenience.<p>Fey
      creatures generally have cordial relationships with animals, allies of
      nature such as druids, and other fey. Exceptions exist where rival
      communities of fey dwell in proximity to one another. In these cases, any
      fey creatures in the vicinity ally with one side or the other according to
      their own inclinations, only rarely standing outside such conflicts. Fey
      creatures derived from horses and the like often serve as mounts, though
      only to other fey or to allies of nature who acknowledge them as at least
      near-equals, if not full partners.<p>“Fey Creature” is an inherited or
      acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature. A
      fey creature retains the base creature’s statistics and special abilities
      except as noted here.<p><b>CR:</b> 9 HD or less, as base creature +1; 10
      HD or more, as base creature +2.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment:</b> Any non-lawful.</p>

      <p><b>Type:</b> The creature’s type changes to fey. Do not recalculate HD,
      BAB, or saves.</p>

      <p><b>Senses:</b> A fey creature gains low-light vision.</p>

      <p><b>Armor Class:</b> Reduce the creature’s natural armor, if any, by 1
      (minimum of 0).</p>

      <p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A fey creature gains a +4 bonus on saves
      against mind-affecting effects, resist cold and electricity 10, and DR
      5/cold iron (if 11 HD or less) or DR 10/cold iron (if 12 HD or more).</p>

      <p><b>Speed:</b> Unless the base creature flies better, the fey creature
      flies at 1-1/2 times the base creature’s land speed (good
      maneuverability), rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5 feet. If the
      creature already has flight with a maneuverability of good, it increases
      to perfect.</p>

      <p><b>Special Abilities:</b> A fey creature gains one of the following
      abilities for every 4 HD or fraction thereof.</p>

      <p><em>Camouflage (Ex) </em>A fey creature can use Stealth to hide in any
      sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or
      concealment. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus does
      not stack with any racial Stealth bonus possessed by the base
      creature.</p>

      <p><em>Change Shape (Su) </em>A fey creature can change shape into a
      single form. Possible forms include a normal specimen of its base
      creature, a humanoid creature within one size category, or an animal
      within one size category. In all cases, the fey creature appears as the
      same individual of its alternate form each time it changes shape. The type
      of polymorph spell used should be chosen as appropriate based on the
      alternate form, such as alter self for taking humanoid form. This ability
      can be selected more than once, granting an additional form each time.</p>

      <p><em>Energy Resistance (Ex) </em>A fey creature gains resistance 10 to
      one energy type, or increases an existing resistance by 10. Resistance
      increased beyond 30 becomes immunity instead. This ability can be selected
      more than once.</p>

      <p><em>Evasion (Ex) </em>A fey creature gains evasion, as the rogue
      ability of the same name.</p>

      <p><em>Long Step (Su) </em>A fey creature can teleport up to 10 feet per
      Hit Die as a move action. It may use this ability once every 1d4
      rounds.</p>

      <p><em>Spell Resistance (Ex) </em>A fey creature gains SR equal to 11 +
      its CR. This does not stack with any existing SR possessed by the base
      creature.</p>

      <p><em>Trackless Step (Ex) </em>A fey creature does not leave a trail in
      natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. It can choose to leave a
      trail, if it so desires.</p>

      <p><em>Vanish (Su) </em>As a swift action, a fey creature can vanish for 1
      round as if affected by invisibility. It can use this ability for 1 round
      per day per Hit Die.</p>

      <p><em>Woodland Stride (Ex) </em>A fey creature can move through any sort
      of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and
      similar terrain) at its normal speed and without taking damage or
      suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that
      have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect it.
      Optionally, this ability may function in a different type of terrain, to
      allow the fey creature to move through, swamps, rocky areas, ice, and so
      forth. Whatever the choice, this ability only functions in one type of
      terrain. This ability can be selected more than once, for a different
      terrain each time.</p>

      <p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> A fey creature with an Intelligence or
      Wisdom score of 8 or more has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities
      depending on its Hit Dice. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable
      once per day. Caster level equals the creature’s HD (or the caster level
      of the base creature’s spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).</p>
