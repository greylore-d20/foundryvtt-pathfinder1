      <p>Your mind is marked by aboleth tampering, either as a result of a close
      encounter with one of these creatures while you were a child, or even
      through an ancestor, close family member, or one of your sisters or
      brothers in faith—this associate’s interaction with the aboleths may be
      all that it takes to infect you. You take a –2 penalty on saving throws
      against mind-affecting effects and add
