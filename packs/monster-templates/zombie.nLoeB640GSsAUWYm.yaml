      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Zombies are the animated corpses of
      dead creatures, forced into foul unlife via necromantic magic like animate
      dead. While the most commonly encountered zombies are slow and tough,
      others possess a variety of traits, allowing them to spread disease or
      move with increased speed.<p>Zombies are unthinking automatons, and can do
      little more than follow orders. When left unattended, zombies tend to mill
      about in search of living creatures to slaughter and devour. Zombies
      attack until destroyed, having no regard for their own safety.<p>Although
      capable of following orders, zombies are more often unleashed into an area
      with no command other than to kill living creatures. As a result, zombies
      are often encountered in packs, wandering around places the living
      frequent, looking for victims. Most zombies are created using animate
      dead. Such zombies are always of the standard type, unless the creator
      also casts haste or remove paralysis to create fast zombies, or contagion
      to create plague zombies.<p>“Zombie” is an acquired template that can be
      added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to
      hereafter as the base creature.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> This depends on
      the creature's new total number of Hit Dice, as follows:</p>

      <p><br>Zombies use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points

      HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b>

      immunities granted by the undead type. Zombies gain DR
      5/slashing.<p><b>Speed:</b> Winged zombies can still fly, but
      maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, so
      can the zombie. Retain all other movement types.<p><b>Attacks:</b> A
      zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and
      weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack
      that deals damage based on the zombie's size, but as if it were one size
      category larger than its actual size (see Natural Attacks).<p><b>Special
      Attacks:</b> A zombie retains none of the base creature's special
      attacks.<p><b>Abilities:</b> Str +2, Dex –2. A zombie has no Con or Int
      score, and its Wis and Cha become 10.<p><b>BAB:</b> A zombie's base attack
      is equal to 3/4 its Hit Dice.<p><b>Skills:</b> A zombie has no skill
      ranks.<p><b>Feats:</b> A zombie loses all feats possessed by the base
      creature, and does not gain feats as its Hit Dice increase, but it does
      gain Toughness as a bonus feat.<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> A zombie loses
      most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary
      special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A zombie gains
      the following special quality.<p><em>Staggered (Ex): </em>Zombies have
      poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or standard action
      each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round
      as a charge action.</p>
