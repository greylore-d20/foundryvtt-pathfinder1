  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Your touch attack causes your target to become painfully malformed. Its
    limbs twist and buckle, while its body contorts uncontrollably, shifting and
    warping. Each round the target suffers excruciating pain and takes 2d6
    points of nonlethal damage, 1 point of Dexterity damage, and 1 point of
    Constitution damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. Once per round as
    a free action on its turn, the target can attempt a new Fortitude saving
    throw to resist the spell for 1 round.</p>
