      "value": "<p>The vigilante can shove one of his foes into another. When the vigilante deals hidden strike damage to a corporeal foe with a melee attack, he can also deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to his reduced hidden strike damage to an opponent adjacent to the first (even if the second opponent is out of his reach). The damage is bludgeoning damage, and if the colliding foe has any natural attacks, the damage is also considered magic, evil, or any other type of damage the natural attack deals. Unlike normal vigilante talents that affect hidden strikes, this vigilante talent applies in all cases when the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.</p>"
