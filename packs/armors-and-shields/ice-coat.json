      "value": "<p>Used by the Erutaki human tribes and snowcaster elves native to the arctic tundra of the Crown of the World, this heavy parka is treated as an armored coatUE. It provides the benefits of a cold-weather outfit, and it can be donned or removed as a move action. In addition, the fluffy white fur of the parka blends into arctic landscapes, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in snowy environments.</p>"
