    value: >-
      <p>You cause the targets to forget all but the most general information
      about you. If they saw you or interacted with you, they still remember
      your presence and your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the
      gist of your interactions with them (such as "She was asking about the
      queen"), but they don't remember specifically what you said, details of
      your appearance, or any identifying information about you. This spell
      targets any memories of you in the minute preceding its casting, but is
      otherwise permanent.</p>
