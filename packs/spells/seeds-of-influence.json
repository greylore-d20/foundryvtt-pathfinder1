    "shortDescription": "<p>You leave a magical trace in the mind of a creature with an attitude of at least indifferent toward you. The target takes a cumulative -2 penalty on its Will save to negate the spell for each step by which its attitude is better than indifferent.  The target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against divination spells you cast. You can target that creature with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than <i>Seeds of Influence</i> as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the modified spell doesn't take longer to cast and doesn't use a higher-level spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast, <i>Seeds of Influence</i> ends for that target. A creature can  be subject to only one <i>Seeds of Influence</i> spell at a time; later castings of <i>Seeds of Influence</i> remove any previous casting.</p>",
