  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can touch a creature, causing it to drift off into a
      permanent slumber. The creature receives a Will save to negate this
      effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep and cannot be woken.
      The effect can only be removed with a wish or similar magic, although
      slaying the witch ends the effect. The witch can use this ability to
      poison food or drink, causing those who ingest it to make a save or fall
      into an eternal slumber. She can only have one such dose of poison at any
      one time, and it loses its potency after 1 minute if not consumed.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target
      of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
