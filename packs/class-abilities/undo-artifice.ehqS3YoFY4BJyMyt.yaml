  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th-level, you gain the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its
      component parts, essentially erasing the hand of artifice and rendering
      the item into a pile of raw natural materials. This effect acts as the
      spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.2sa3881har33geo1]{Polymorph Any Object},
      working on both magical and nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration is
      always permanent. Unlike polymorph any object, it cannot be used to mimic
      the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a
      Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect. Magic items receive a
      circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp in the
      item's value.</p>

      <p>You may use undo artifice a number of times per day equal to your
      Charisma modifier.</p>
