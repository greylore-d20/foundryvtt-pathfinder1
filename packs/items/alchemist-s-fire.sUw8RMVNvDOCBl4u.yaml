  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a <em>splash weapon</em>
      with a range increment of 10 feet.</p><p>A direct hit deals 1d6 points of
      fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask
      hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following
      a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If
      desired, the target can use a <em>full-round action</em> to attempt to
      extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing
      the flames requires a DC 15 <em>Reflex</em> save. Rolling on the ground
      provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or
      magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the
      fire.</p><p><em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC: 20</p><h3>Alchemical Power
