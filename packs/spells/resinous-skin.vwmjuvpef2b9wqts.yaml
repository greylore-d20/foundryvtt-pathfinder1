      <p>You coat your body with a resinous substance, protecting you from
      attacks and binding weapons that strike you. You gain DR 5/piercing, as
      well as a +4 circumstance bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts and on
      saving throws against effects that cause you to drop something you are
      holding. Additionally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver
      checks to initiate a grapple, maintain a grapple, and pin a foe. Any enemy
      you grapple takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to
      escape the grapple using Escape Artist. Any weapon, that strikes you
      becomes stuck unless its wielder succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. Such a
      weapon can be pulled free of you only with a successful Strength check (DC
      = your saving throw DC for this spell). This spell has no effect on
      unarmed strikes or natural weapons.</p>
