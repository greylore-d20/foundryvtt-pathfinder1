  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist can alter the properties of a poison, causing it to
      persist longer in the victim’s body. Altering a dose of poison in the way
      takes 1 hour, requires the expenditure of raw materials worth half the
      poison’s market price, and exposes the alchemist to the poison, thereby
      affecting him if he is not immune. This doubles the poison’s maximum
      duration.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
