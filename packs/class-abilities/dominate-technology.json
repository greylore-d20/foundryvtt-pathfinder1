Once per day, you can target one construct with @Compendium[pf1.spells.cqjtlth3uqafuwnn]{Control Construct}&nbsp;(as per the spell), except the DC of the Spellcraft check each round to maintain control of the construct is equal to 15 + the construct’s HD.</p>\n<p>If you must attempt opposed Spellcraft checks against the construct’s creator, you take a –5 penalty on your Spellcraft checks while you concentrate on this ability.</p>"
