  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp
      and strike an opponent, then instantly return to you. You can make a
      single attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is
      treated as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your
      Wisdom modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier (you
      still add your Strength modifier to the damage roll as normal).</p>

      <p>This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver.</p>
