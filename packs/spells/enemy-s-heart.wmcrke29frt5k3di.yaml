  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cut out an enemy's heart and consume it, absorbing that enemy's power
    as your own. As part of casting this spell, you perform a coup de grace with
    a slashing weapon on a helpless, living adjacent target. If the target dies,
    you eat its heart to gain the spell's benefits. If the target survives, the
    spell is not wasted and you can try again as long as you continue
    concentrating on the spell. When you consume the heart, you gain the
    benefits of a <i>death knell</i> spell, except you gain 1d8 temporary hit
    points +1 per Hit Die of the target, and the bonus to Strength is a profane
    bonus.</p>
