  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cut yourself with the dagger, dealing yourself 1d6 points of bleed
    damage. So long as you keep taking this bleed damage, your targets each
    bleed for 1d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turns. The bleed
    damage on any target ends if that target receives magical healing, or if
    your bleed damage ends for any reason. This spell has no effect if you're
    immune to bleed damage or can otherwise reduce or ignore the bleed damage to
    yourself.</p>
