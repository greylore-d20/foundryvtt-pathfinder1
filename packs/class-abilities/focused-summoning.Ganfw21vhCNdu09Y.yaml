  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When an arcanist is on a plane other than the Material Plane, she can
      expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as part of casting a spell that
      summons a single outsider native to that plane. If she does so, the
      outsiderâ€™s attacks bypass all types of DR that it has. For example, a
      nabasu demon, which has DR/cold iron or DR/good, would bypass both DR/cold
      iron and DR/good.</p>
