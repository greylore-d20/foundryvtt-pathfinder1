  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, the cavalier gains DR 1/â€” and a +2 morale bonus on saving
      throws when wearing light armor or no armor and fighting defensively or
      using @Compendium[pf1.feats.NFxHebU1XhEs5WJh]{Combat Expertise}. At 6th
      level and every 4 levels thereafter, this DR increases by 1. He loses the
      benefits of this ability if carrying a medium or heavier load.</p>
