  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A shadowy afterimage trails behind the targeted weapon, potentially
      damaging foes even when the weapon misses. Once per round, when the
      weapon's wielder misses a creature with the target weapon, the wielder can
      reroll the attack. If the reroll hits, the spell hits the targeted
      creature and deals 1d8 points of cold damage, plus 1 additional point per
      2 caster levels (maximum +10). If an attacked creature has spell
      resistance, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)
      against that spell resistance the first time the spell damages the target.
      If the creature successfully resists <i>umbral weapon</i>, the spell is
      dispelled. If not, the creature takes damage as normal.</p>
