  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The handle of this axe is long enough that you can wield it one-handed
      or two-handed. The head may have one blade or two, with blade shapes
      ranging from half-moons to squared edges like narrower versions of
      woodcutting axes. The wooden haft may be protected and strengthened with
      metal bands called langets.</p>
