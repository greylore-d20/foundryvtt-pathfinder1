      "value": "<p>Like the great dragons, you can take to the skies and terrorize opponents from above. As a swift action, you can manifest leathery dragon wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (clumsy maneuverability).</p>\n<p>At 10th level, your maneuverability increases to poor. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day for each oracle level you have. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>\n<p>At 11th level you can use these wings for 10 minutes per day for each oracle level you have.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you can use the wings indefinitely.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
