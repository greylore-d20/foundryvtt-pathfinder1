    focus: the page to be memorized
  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target gains a perfect memory of the page you used as a focus
    component. The target can visualize this page as easily as looking at it in
    person, including minute details visible to close scrutiny by the naked eye.
    The memory of the page includes text and images, such as a drawing or a map.
    Someone unfamiliar with the language on the page (or even an illiterate
    person) could relay what is written simply by copying the shapes of the
    letters so another person can read them.</p><p>The maximum number of pages
    that a particular target can memorize through repeated castings of this
    spell is equal to the target's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); any
    attempts beyond this limit have no effect, although the target's memory of a
    page could be erased (using <i>modify memory</i> or a similar effect) to
    effectively make room for a different one.</p><p>A creature that memorizes
    magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) cannot borrow,
    duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. However, this would
    allow a wizard to copy a spell into his spellbook so he could prepare the
    spell from his book (assuming the spell takes up only one page in a
    spellbook).</p>
