  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, the witch can perform a 10-minute ritual to create a
      potion imbued with the power of one of her hexes. Any creature that
      consumes this potion is affected by the hex as if cast by its creator. The
      witch canâ€™t use that hex until the potion is consumed or rendered
      inert.</p>

      <p>Only hexes that can target a creature other than the witch can be
      distilled in this way. The potion remains potent until consumed or
      rendered inert by the witch as a free action.</p>

      <p>A witch must have the cauldron hex to select this hex.</p>
