      <p>A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb
      that's adorned at one end by a metal cap fitted with prongs and plugs. The
      crystal's interior contains sparkling veins of glittering light. A memory
      facet is a high-capacity storage device capable of containing a staggering
      amount of programming-these devices were rare and difficult to craft, and
      at the time <em>Divinity </em>began its mission, they were primarily used
      for one purpose: storing and transporting the staggeringly complex code
      required to program and enhance artificial intelligences. To use a memory
      facet, one needs simply to insert the crystal's connectors into an
      appropriate slot in an AI's core processor or a robot under the AI's
      control. A core processor or robot can hold as many memory facets as it
      has available slots, but at any one time, an AI can benefit from a maximum
      number of memory facets equal to its CR divided by 4 (minimum 1). The AI
      can gain the benefits of memory facets installed in any of the robots and
      processors it controls-where a memory facet is installed makes little
      difference, but most AIs prefer to keep their memory facets installed in
      their most secure locations.</p><p>Each memory facet contains a unique
      combination of emotions, knowledge, traits, and personality quirks
      designed to enhance and bolster an artificial intelligence's capabilities.
      In rare cases, destructive memory facets were created-items intended to
      disable or damage an artificial intelligence in case of emergencies. An AI
      immediately gains all of the advantages (and any disadvantages) associated
      with a particular memory facet as soon as it is installed (this is a
      full-round action). Memory facets can change an AI's personality or even
      its alignment. An AI can try to resist having a memory facet added to its
      code by attempting a DC 20 Will save. If the AI is successful, the memory
      facet ceases functioning for 1d4 rounds, and must be extracted and
      reinstalled to make a second attempt to changing the AI's code. Once
      installed, a memory facet is difficult to remove; removing one requires
      either a successful DC 25 Strength check to wrench free or a successful DC
      30 Disable Device check. Both attempts are full-round
      actions.</p><p>Listed below are rules for the memory facets in this
      adventure-future adventures will contain rules for other types of memory
      facets, and in the final adventure, the PCs can use their collected facets
      not only to fight against Unity, but also to augment and enhance their own
      AI ally, the oracle Casandalee.</p><p><strong>Aggression Facet</strong>:
      This memory facet enhances an AI's offensive protocols, imparting a +2
      bonus on all attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, and granting Deadly Aim
      and Power Attack as bonus feats when the AI is controlling a robot.</p>
