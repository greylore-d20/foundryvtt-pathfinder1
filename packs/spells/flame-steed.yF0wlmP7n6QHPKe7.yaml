      <p>You conjure a Large, quasi-real creature made of flame. It functions
      like @Compendium[pf1.spells.zpwd0f19q1lm04p3]{Phantom Steed}, except as
      follows.</p>

      <p>The flame steed is immune to fire and has acid, cold, and electricity
      resistance 10. If it or its rider is attacked, it automatically exhales a
      15-foot cone of smoke and ash on your turn as a free action. Anyone in the
      cone must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC equal to the spell DC) or become
      sickened for 1d6 rounds after leaving the area. This smoke acts as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.tuh5vc2bojaws3ig]{Obscuring Mist} for the purpose
      of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round.</p>
