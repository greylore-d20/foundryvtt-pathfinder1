    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can create a ball of entropic protoplasm and hurl it
      at targets within 30 feet. This protoplasm acts as a <em>tanglefoot
      bag</em> that also inflicts 1 point of acid damage per round to a creature
      <em>entangled</em> by it. The protoplasm dissolves within 1d3 rounds. You
      may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Charisma</em> modifier.</p>
