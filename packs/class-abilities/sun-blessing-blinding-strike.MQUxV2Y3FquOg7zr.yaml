      <p>At 1st level, you can create a flash of sunlight in the eyes of one of
      your opponents. The target is blinded for 1 round. If it succeeds at a
      Reflex saving throw, it’s instead dazzled for 1 round. Creatures with
      light blindness or light sensitivity take a –4 penalty on this saving
      throw. This is a light effect.</p>

      <p>Sightless creatures are unaffected by this ability.</p>
