      <p>You can repel or attract metal objects in a vast line with a magnetism
      so strong that there is no hope of escaping. This functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.oeemcnfjod9zd7my]{Repel Metal or Stone}, except
      only for metal objects, and you can also pull the objects toward you
      instead of pushing them away. The effect lasts for 1 round, and the
      pulling version of the effect canâ€™t pull objects into the air unless they
      are already airborne.</p>

      <p>You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 1 round per
      kineticist level you have.</p>
