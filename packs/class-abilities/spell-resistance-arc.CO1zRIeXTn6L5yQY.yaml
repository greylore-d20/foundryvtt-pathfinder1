  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can grant herself spell resistance for a number of rounds
      equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) as a standard action by
      expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This spell resistance is
      equal to 6 + her arcanist level and cannot be suppressed, but it can be
      ended as a free action on her turn.</p>
