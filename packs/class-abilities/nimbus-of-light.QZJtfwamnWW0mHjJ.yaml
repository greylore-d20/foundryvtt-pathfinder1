  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot nimbus of light for a number of
      rounds per day equal to your cleric level. This acts as a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.7x2z0i8rcx7s81fk]{Daylight} spell. In addition,
      undead within this radius take an amount of damage equal to your cleric
      level each round that they remain inside the nimbus. Spells and spell-like
      abilities with the darkness descriptor are automatically dispelled if
      brought inside this nimbus. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>
