  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You commune with the soul of a dead creature. To cast this spell, you
    must be at the soul's place of death or be in the soul's presence, whether
    it is contained in a receptacle, powers an intelligent magic item, or other
    possibilities. The soul can attempt a Will save to resist the spell as if it
    were alive.  A soul contacted this way can speak normally in any language it
    knows. Unlike <i>speak with dead</i> and similar spells, you are not limited
    to asking questions and can engage in normal conversation with the soul (and
    vice versa). The soul isn't an undead creature and isn't compelled to speak
    or be truthful. Generally, the soul only knows what it knew in life,
    although souls that persisted with awareness of their surroundings after
    death may have more to offer.</p>
