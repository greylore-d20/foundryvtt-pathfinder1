      <p>You instill the target with an intense, instinctual fear of a condition
      or circumstance, more powerful than the <i>phobia</i> lesser madness (see
      page 182). You can name an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or
      sonic), a hazard (such as an avalanche or earthquake), or a single
      creature of the animal type or all vermin (applying when the target sees a
      swarm or a single Small or larger creature). Alternatively, you can name
      the following specific environments: darkness (darker than dim light, and
      you can't apply this <i>phobia</i> to a creature with natural racial
      darkvision, see in darkness, blindsight, or similar senses), enclosed
      spaces (places that require the creature to squeeze),heights (10 times
      the  target's height, and you can't apply this <i>phobia</i> to creatures
      with a natural fly speed), or water (you can't apply this <i>phobia</i> to
      aquatic creatures or creatures with a natural swim speed).  When the
      target takes damage of the energy type (for an energy type <i>phobia</i>),
      or perceives the presence of the creature, environment, or hazard, it must
      attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it fails, it becomes panicked, but even if
      it succeeds, it becomes shaken and feels intensely uncomfortable; a
      creature shaken in this way does not need to roll further saving throws
      against its <i>phobia</i> until its shaken condition ends, even if it
      continues to be exposed to its <i>phobia</i>.  A creature panicked by
      <i>phobia</i> can begin to act normally 1 minute after it ceases being
      able to perceive its <i>phobia</i> or after taking the energy damage if
      the <i>phobia</i> is an energy type, though the shaken condition ends
      immediately after the creature can no longer perceive its <i>phobia</i>.
      <i>Break enchantment</i>, <i>heal</i>, <i>limited wish</i>,
      <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> can remove a <i>phobia</i> spell.</p>
