      "value": "<p>At 5th level when you would be reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by an attack, you can spend 2 points from your phrenic pool as an immediate action to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 points of damage + your psychic level.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, this ability’s healing increases to 3d8 + your psychic level. If this healing is insufficient to bring you above negative hit points, you are automatically stabilized.</p>\n<p>If you would still be killed by the amount of damage taken, you erupt with positive energy and heal all allies within 30-foot-radius burst for the amount you healed yourself.</p>"
