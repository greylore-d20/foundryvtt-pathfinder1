    "shortDescription": "<p>You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The <i>illusory script</i> appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character.</p><p>Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a <i>suggestion</i> implanted in the script by you at the time the <i>illusory script</i> spell was cast. The <i>suggestion</i> lasts only 30 minutes. Typical <i>suggestion</i>s include \"Close the book and leave,\" \"Forget the existence of this note,\" and so forth. If successfully dispelled by <i>dispel magic,</i> the <i>illusory script</i> and its secret message disappear.</p><p>The hidden message can be read by a combination of the <i>true seeing</i> spell with the <i>read magic</i> or <i>comprehend languages</i> spell.</p>",
