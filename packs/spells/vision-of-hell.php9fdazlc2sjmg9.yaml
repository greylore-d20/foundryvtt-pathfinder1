  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You overlay a realistic illusion of a terrifying hellscape upon an area.
    Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden, though
    environmental features take on an infernal appearance. While you are
    prepared for these images and are not affected by them, any other creature
    within the area must make a Will save or become shaken and also take a -2
    penalty on saves versus fear effects; the fear and penalty persists as long
    as the creature remains in the area. Devils and any lawful evil creatures
    suffer no negative effects from this spell.</p>
