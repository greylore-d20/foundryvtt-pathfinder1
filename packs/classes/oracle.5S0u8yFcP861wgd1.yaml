      <p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more
      mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without
      their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not
      fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to
      a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those
      patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single
      source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs.
      While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a
      curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen
      ways.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Oracles do not usually associate with
      any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own,
      or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use
      their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their
      mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and
      sick.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The oracleâ€™s class skills are Craft
      (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge
      (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive
      (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class
      skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
