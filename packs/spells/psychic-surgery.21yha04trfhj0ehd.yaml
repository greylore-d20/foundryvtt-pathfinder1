      <p><i>Psychic surgery</i> cures the target of all Intelligence, Wisdom,
      and Charisma damage and restores all points permanently drained from the
      target's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also eliminates all
      ongoing insanity, confusion, and fear effects. <i>Psychic surgery</i> can
      also remove other mental afflictions, including enchantment spells and
      abilities, and even instantaneous effects, but in this case, if <i>dispel
      magic</i> couldn't remove the effect, psychic surgery works only if the
      spell level or equivalent spell level of the effect was 6th level or
      lower. <i>Psychic surgery</i> removes all effects magically altering the
      target's memory, even instantaneous effects, and it can restore a memory
      to perfect clarity like the second use of <i>modify memory</i>.</p>
