  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A <i>discern location</i> spell is among the most powerful means of
      locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a <i>mind blank</i> spell
      or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact
      location of a single individual or object. <i>Discern location</i>
      circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell
      reveals the name of the creature or object's location (place, name,
      business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar
      political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where
      the target lies.</p><p>To find a creature with the spell, you must have
      seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an
      object, you must have touched it at least once.</p>
