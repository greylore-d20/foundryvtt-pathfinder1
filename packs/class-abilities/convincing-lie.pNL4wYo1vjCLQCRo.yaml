    value: >-
      <p>When a rogue with this talent lies, she creates fabrications so
      convincing that others treat them as truth. When a rogue with this talent
      successfully uses the Bluff skill to convince someone that what she is
      saying is true, if that individual is questioned later about the statement
      or story, that person uses the rogue’s Bluff skill modifier to convince
      the questioner, rather than his own. If his Bluff skill modifier is better
      than the rogue’s, the individual can use his own modifier and gain a +2
      bonus on any check to convince others of the lie. This effect lasts for a
      number of days equal to 1/2 the rogue’s level + the rogue’s Charisma
      modifier.</p>
