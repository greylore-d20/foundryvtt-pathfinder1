      "value": "\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>\r\n<p>These potent additives can only be culled from a rare maple tree known to grow exclusively in urban areas. These small, elaborately twisting trees are extremely slow to grow and mature-the leaves reach maturity only once every 3 years-and they are almost always grown and cultivated by <em>half-elves</em>. Additionally, <em>half-elves</em> are keenly aware of the effort put into the leaves' growth and normally only sell the products of their labors to others of their kind. When the golden maple's delicate, five-pointed leaves finally take on their namesake's color, they can be cut, dried, and then ground into a fine powder, a process that requires a DC 15 <em>Knowledge</em> (nature) or <em>Profession</em> (herbalist) check. When used in conjunction with the <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) skill to create special substances and items like alchemical grease or <em>tanglefoot bags</em>, golden maple leaves reduce the <em>Craft</em> DC by 5 and add +1 to the DC of any save required by the alchemical item. A single dose of golden maple leaf powder is sufficient to augment the crafting of three alchemical items.</p>\r\n"
