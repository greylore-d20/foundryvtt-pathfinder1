    value: >-
      <p>This medium armor consists of hundreds of small, interlocking pieces of
      steel shaped to resemble an ancient symbol for the word “mountain.” The
      mail is then riveted to a cloth or leather backing. It is worn like a mail
      coat and covers your torso, shoulders, and thighs.</p>
