      <p>You can channel the hostile, unforgiving heat of the sun into your
      touch. This is a melee touch attack that deals 1d8 points of fire damage
      per 2 oracle levels (Fortitude half ). Against a plant creature, this
      touch heals or damages the creature (your choice) for 1d6 points of fire
      damage per oracle level.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, a creature that fails its save against this revelation
      becomes sickened for 1d4 hours in addition to taking fire damage.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, your touch is so intense that a creature that fails its
      save is also staggered for 1d6 rounds.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day
      at 10th level.</p>
