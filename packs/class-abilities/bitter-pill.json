      "value": "<p>The alchemist becomes bitter in flavor. Any creature that hits the bitter alchemist with a bite attack gains the sickened condition for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Constitution modifier). Any creature that swallows the alchemist whole gains the nauseated condition for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (same DC as above). If the alchemist is trapped in the creature’s gullet and it becomes nauseated, the creature vomits him back out immediately as a free action at the start of the creature’s turn; the alchemist lands prone adjacent to the creature.</p>"
