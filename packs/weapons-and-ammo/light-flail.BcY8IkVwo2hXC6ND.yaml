  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A light flail consists of a weighted striking end connected to a handle
      by a sturdy chain. Though often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like
      the head of a morningstar, the head of a light flail can actually take
      many different shapes, such as short bars. Military flails are sturdier
      evolutions of agricultural flails, which are used for threshing-beating
      stacks of grains to separate the useful grains from their husks.</p>
