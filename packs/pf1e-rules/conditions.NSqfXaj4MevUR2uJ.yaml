        <p>A creature that is taking bleed damage takes the listed amount of
        damage at the beginning of its turn. Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15
        @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.nHbYSOoe1SzqEO9w]{Heal}
        check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point
        damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Some bleed effects cause
        ability damage or even ability drain. Bleed effects do not stack with
        each other unless they deal different kinds of damage. When two or more
        bleed effects deal the same kind of damage, take the worse effect. In
        this case, ability drain is worse than ability damage.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <p><b>Q</b>: Do you re-roll bleed damage each round, or continue
        bleeding the same amount each round based on the initial bleed damage
        roll?<br><b>A</b>: If the bleed damage is expressed as a die roll you
        reroll the damage each round.</p>

        <p>In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that
        isn’t as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into
        a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move
        into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while
        squeezed in a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a
        –4 penalty to AC.</p><p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up 4
        squares) squeezes into a space that’s 1 square wide, the creature’s
        miniature figure occupies 2 squares, centered on the line between the 2
        squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area
        it squeezes into.</p><p>A creature can squeeze past a creature while
        moving but it can’t end its movement in an occupied square.</p><p>To
        squeeze through or into a space less than half your space’s width, you
        must use the Escape Artist skill. You can’t attack while using Escape
        Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty
        to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
