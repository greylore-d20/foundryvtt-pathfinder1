      <p>This spell makes a weapon magically <i>keen</i>, improving its ability
      to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the
      weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20
      becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be
      cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow
      bolts, the <i><i>keen</i> edge</i> on a particular projectile ends after
      one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended
      target.</p><p>Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for
      the purpose of this spell.</p><p>Multiple effects that increase a weapon's
      threat range (such as the <i>keen</i> special weapon property and the
      Improved Critical feat) don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a
      natural weapon, such as a claw.</p>
