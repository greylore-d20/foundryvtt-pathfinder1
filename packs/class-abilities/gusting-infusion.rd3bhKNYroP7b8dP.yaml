      <p>The wind from your infusion causes your blast to act as an
      instantaneous gust of wind. If your blast has a clear path, you can accept
      2 additional points of burn or reduce the damage to 0 in order to cause
      the gust of wind effect to persist for 1 round along that path.</p>
