      <p>This lab is used for making alchemical items, and provides a +2
      <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) checks. It has no
      bearing on the costs related to the <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) skill.
      Without this lab, a character with the <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) skill is
      assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the +2
      bonus that the lab provides.</p>
