  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a melee touch attack, you can cause a creature's vision to be
      fraught with shadows and darkness. The creature touched treats all other
      creatures as if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all
      attack rolls. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
      cleric level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per
      day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
