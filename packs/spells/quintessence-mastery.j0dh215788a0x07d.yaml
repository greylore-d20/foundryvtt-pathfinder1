  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell grants the caster limited control over the quintessence of
      an Outer Plane. The control granted by <i>quintessence mastery</i> can
      take one of two forms, depending on the version of the spell cast. Both
      versions can be cast only on one of the nine Outer Planes, for it is these
      planes, not the Transitive or Inner Planes, that are comprised of
      quintessence. <b>Planewarp</b>: This allows the caster to <i>create</i>
      various objects or effects. When this spell is cast, you can replicate a
      number of effects from one or more of the following spells: <i>control
      water</i>, <i>diminish plants</i>, <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>major
      creation</i>, <i>move earth</i>, <i>plant growth</i>, <i>secure
      shelter</i>, <i>soften earth and stone</i>, <i>spike growth</i>, <i>spike
      stones</i>, <i>stone shape</i>, <i>transmute mud to rock</i>, <i>transmute
      rock to mud</i>, <i>Wall of Stone</i>, or <i>Wall of Thorns</i>. The total
      spell levels of effects to be created must not exceed 8. For example, you
      could use this spell to replicate the effects of <i>fog cloud</i>,
      <i>secure shelter</i>, and <i>soften earth and stone</i> (since these
      three spells have levels that add up to 8) or <i>diminish plants</i> and
      <i>spike stones</i> (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7),
      but not <i>move earth</i> and <i>plant growth</i> (since these two spells
      have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists
      at different levels, use the lowest level-<i>control water</i>, for
      example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it's a 6th-level spell
      for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM's
      discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other
      sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells.
      This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1
      hour per caster level or until its effects are expended. <b>Shape
      Realm</b>: This functions similarly to <i>create</i> demiplaneUM, except
      that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather
      than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You
      cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by
      the plane's traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion
      of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained. At the GM's discretion,
      additional restrictions beyond those listed in the <i>create</i> demiplane
      spell may limit this spell's effects, and additional options for
      customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell
      has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for 1 day per caster level. This
      version of <i>quintessence mastery</i> can be made permanent in the same
      way and for the same cost as <i>create</i> demiplane. This version of
      <i>quintessence mastery</i> does not function within the boundaries of a
      divine realm.</p>
