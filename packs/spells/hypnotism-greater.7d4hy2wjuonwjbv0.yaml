      <p>This functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.3ntxp3zun1j9mf0m]{Hypnotism},
      except it affects 2 Hit Die of creatures per caster level you have. You
      can make up to five requests (instead of a single request) to each
      creature affected by the spell, and the requests can be as long and as
      complicated as you desire (though they still must be reasonable).</p>
