      <p>With a single touch, you transfer some of your life essence to the
      subject, transferring your hit points and your resolve. When you touch the
      subject you can transfer up to a number of hit points equal to your
      Constitution score to the target. These hit points heal the subject, but
      cannot raise the subject's hit points higher than its normal hit point
      total. In addition, the subject gains DR/evil equal to your Charisma bonus
      (if any) for the duration of the spell.</p>
