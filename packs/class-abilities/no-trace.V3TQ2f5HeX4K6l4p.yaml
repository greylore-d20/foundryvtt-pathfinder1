  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and
      conceal her presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill
      increases by +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on
      Disguise skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is
      stationary and does not take any action for at least 1 round. Every three
      levels thereafter, the increase to Survival DCs and the bonuses on
      Disguise and opposed Stealth checks increase by 1.</p>
