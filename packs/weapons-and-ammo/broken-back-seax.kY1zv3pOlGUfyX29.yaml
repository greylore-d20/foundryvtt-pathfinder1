  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Used in Avistan since before Earthfall, seaxes are straight,
      single-edged blades. The broken-back seax is the size of a short sword,
      and has a broad blade with a distinctive trapezoidal shape. If your
      Strength score is less than 15, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls with
      a broken-back seax, as you're unable to put enough force into the blows to
      land them effectively.</p>
