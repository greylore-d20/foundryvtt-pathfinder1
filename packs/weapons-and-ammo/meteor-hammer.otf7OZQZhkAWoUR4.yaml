  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon consists of one or two spherical weights attached by a
      10-foot chain. You whirl the weights and wrap them around an opponent's
      body. If you succeed at a trip attempt with a meteor hammer, you can drag
      your opponent 5 feet closer to you rather than knocking her prone. You may
      use this weapon in two different ways: In meteor mode you use it as a
      double weapon, while in fortress mode you cannot use it as a double weapon
      but gain reach and a +1 shield bonus to AC. Switching between these two
      modes is a free action decided at the start of your turn.</p>
