    value: >-
      <p>You inflict a painful, itching rash on the target creature. The target
      is sickened and takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity (this penalty cannot lower
      Dexterity below 0). The target can spend a move action scratching
      furiously at the rash to remove the sickened condition (but not the
      Dexterity penalty) until the start of its next turn.</p>
