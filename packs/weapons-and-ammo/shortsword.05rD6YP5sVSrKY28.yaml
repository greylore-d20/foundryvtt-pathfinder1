  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Short swords are some of the most common weapons found in any martial
      society, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on the region
      and creator. Most are around 2 feet in length. Their blades can be curved
      or straight, single- or double-edged, and wide or narrow. Hilts may be
      ornate or simple, with crossguards, basket hilts, or no guard at all. Such
      weapons are often used on their own, but can also be paired as a matched
      set, or used in conjunction with a dagger or longer sword.</p>
