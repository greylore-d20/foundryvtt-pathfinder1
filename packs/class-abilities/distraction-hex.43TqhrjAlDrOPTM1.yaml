  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer hallucinatory
      distractions whenever it tries to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability
      for 1 round. Anytime the creature attempts to do so, it must succeed at a
      concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell level) or lose the spell. A
      successful Will saving throw negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th
      level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. Whether or not the
      save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for
      1 day.</p><p>Hexes that affect the misfortune hex, such as cackle, also
      affect distraction.</p>
