  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, a vampire hunter can intensify a vampire’s revulsion to
      strongly presented holy symbols. When a vampire hunter uses a <em>standard
      action</em> to confront a <em>vampire</em> with a presented <em>holy
      symbol</em>, the vampire must attempt a <em>Will</em> saving throw (DC =
      15 + the vampire hunter’s class level + the vampire hunter’s
      <em>Charisma</em> modifier). On a failed save, the vampire is repulsed and
      must stay a number of feet from the vampire hunter equal to 5 times the
      vampire hunter’s <em>Charisma</em> modifier. Additionally, a vampire
      repulsed in this way cannot touch or make melee attacks against the
      vampire hunter (although the vampire can still touch and make melee
      attacks against the vampire hunter’s allies as normal). A vampire
      continues to be repulsed for every round the vampire hunter spends
      presenting a <em>holy symbol</em> (a <em>standard action</em>), though it
      can attempt a new <em>Will</em> save every round to overcome its revulsion
      and act normally.</p>

      <p>The vampire hunter can use any <em>holy symbol</em> to repulse a
      vampire, but for the purposes of this ability, the vampire hunter treats
      his <em>Charisma</em> modifier as being 2 higher when he employs the
      symbol of the deity he worships.</p>
