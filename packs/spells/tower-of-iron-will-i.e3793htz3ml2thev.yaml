      <p>You project a fortress of mental power that blocks out the psychic
      energy of others, granting mental strength and resiliency to all inside
      the area. All creatures inside the area gain spell resistance equal to 10
      + double this spell's level against psychic magic and any mind-affecting
      effects. Creatures inside the area don't receive this protection against
      your spells or special abilities.</p>
