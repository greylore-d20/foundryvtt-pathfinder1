  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the investigator deals damage with a studied strike, the target
      must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the investigatorâ€™s class
      level + her Intelligence modifier) or be unable to speak (even for verbal
      components) for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful save reduces the duration to 1
      round. This talent has no effect on creatures immune to critical hits.</p>

      <p>An investigator must be at least 15th level to select this talent.</p>
