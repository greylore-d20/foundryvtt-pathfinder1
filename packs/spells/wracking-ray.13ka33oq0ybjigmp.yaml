  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A ray of sickly greenish-gray negative energy issues forth from the palm
    of your hand. Make a ranged touch attack against the target. A creature hit
    by this spell is wracked by painful spasms as its muscles and sinews wither
    and twist. The subject takes 1d4 points of Dexterity and Strength damage per
    3 caster levels you possess (maximum 5d4 each). This spell cannot reduce an
    ability score below 1. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage.</p>
