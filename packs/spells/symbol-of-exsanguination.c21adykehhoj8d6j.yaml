  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that each
    creature within the radius of <i>Symbol of Exsanguination</i> begins to
    bleed uncontrollably and violently from their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth,
    as well as any existing open wounds. Creatures that failed their saving
    throws immediately take 1d6 points of bleed damage and are sickened as long
    as they continue to take bleed damage from the symbol.  While a DC 15 Heal
    check or magical healing can end the bleed damage as normal, the bleed
    damage and sickened condition begin again each round so long as the creature
    begins its turn still within 60 feet of the symbol, including if the
    creature leaves the area and returns. Creatures that succeed at their saving
    throw suffer no ill effects from the symbol, even if they leave its area and
    return.  Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>Symbol of Exsanguination</i> has
    no hit point limit on the creatures it can affect. Once triggered, a
    <i>Symbol of Exsanguination</i> remains active for 10 minutes per caster
    level.  Magic traps such as <i>Symbol of Exsanguination</i> are hard to
    detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol,
    only a character who has the trapfinding class feature can use Disable
    Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is equal to 25 + spell level, or 28
    (27 for a bloodrager) for <i>Symbol of Exsanguination</i>.</p>
