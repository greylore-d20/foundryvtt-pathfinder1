            <p>This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom
            and one side to create a bag for sleeping in. Some have cloth straps
            along the open side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are
            sleeping. It can be rolled and tied into a tight coil for storage or
            transport. Most people use a <em>blanket</em> with the bedroll to
            stay warm or provide a ground cushion.</p>

            <h3>Magic Containers</h3>

            <p>Magic containers come in almost as many varieties as there are
            <em>alchemists</em>, and so are of inestimable value to
            <em>alchemists</em> with specific needs. Some of the most well-known
            magic containers are described here.</p>

            <p>Because of a varied nature of alchemical items and their effects,
            not all combinations of alchemical items and magic bottles are
            viable or even make sense, even though they technically might be
            allowed by the rules. The GM should have the final say on whether or
            not a particular alchemical item can function within one of the
            magical containers listed in this section.</p>

            <h4>Rope</h4>

            <p><b>Hempen</b> The DC to escape hemp rope bonds is equal to 20 +
            the CMB of the creature that tied the bonds. Ropes do not need to
            make a check every round to maintain the pin. If the DC to escape is
            higher than 20 + the tying creatures CMB, the tied up creature
            cannot escape from the bonds, even with a natural 20 on the check.
            This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength
            check. <b>Price</b> 1 gp; <b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>FYI</b>: The <em>Equipment Trick</em> feat provides a number
            of options for using this item in combat.</p>

            <p><b>Silk Rope</b> This 50-foot length of silk rope has 4 hit
            points and can be broken with a DC 24 Strength check. <b>Price</b>
            10 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>Bloodvine Rope</b> This 50-foot length of tough, lightweight
            rope is made from alchemically treated bloodvine, a rare
            scarlet-colored vine that grows only in warm jungle environments.
            Though prized by climbers for its durability, bloodvine can also be
            used to bind creatures. Bloodvine rope has a <em>hardness</em> of 5
            and 10 <em>hit points</em>, and can be broken with a DC 30
            <em>Strength</em> check. A creature bound by bloodvine rope can
            escape with a DC 35 <em>Escape Artist</em> check or a DC 30
            <em>Strength</em> check. The DC to create bloodvine rope with
            <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) is 30. <b>Price</b> 200 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5
            lbs. <b>Source</b> <em>PRG:ACG</em></p>

            <p><b>Spider's Silk Rope</b> This 50-foot length of rope is woven of
            strands of silk from monstrous spiders. Rare to virtually
            nonexistent on the surface world, it is commonly used by the dark
            elves, though shorter spider's silk rope scraps (generally no more
            than 10 feet long) occasionally appear among goblins. Spider's silk
            rope has 6 hit points and can be broken with a DC 25 Strength check.
