      "value": "<p><em>A tailblade is a small, sharp knife designed to be strapped to the tip of a wielder’s tail.</em></p>\n<p>A ratfolk wielding a tailblade can make a tail attack, adding its <em>Strength</em> modifier to the tailblade’s damage.</p>\n<p>Ratfolk are considered proficient with such attacks and can apply feats or effects appropriate to <em>natural attacks</em> to tail attacks made with a tailblade. If used as part of a full attack action, attacks with a tailblade are considered secondary attacks.</p>\n<p>It takes a <em>full-round action</em> to strap on or remove a tailblade. The wearer can loosely attach the tailblade (without strapping it securely in place) as a <em>move action</em>, but using a loosely attached tailblade gives the wielder a –4 penalty on all <em>attack rolls</em> made with the weapon, and other creatures get a +4 bonus on <em>disarm</em> <em>combat maneuver</em> checks to <em>disarm</em> the tailblade.</p>"
