  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the character creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra
      bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after
      the character sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to
      occupy one of the character's daily extract slots. An infused extract can
      be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.</p>
