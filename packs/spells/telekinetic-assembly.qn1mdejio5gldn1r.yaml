  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You assemble a siege engine, using up to one fewer worker per two caster
    levels you possess. You can do without one additional worker if you have any
    ranks in Knowledge (engineering), plus one additional worker per 5 ranks you
    have in that skill. If your  caster level combined with Knowledge
    (engineering) fails to eliminate the need for workers, this spell fails.</p>
