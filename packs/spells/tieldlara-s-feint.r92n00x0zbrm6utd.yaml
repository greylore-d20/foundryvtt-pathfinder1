    value: >-
      <p>With a lascivious wink and a sensuous sway, you flood a foe's mind with
      lustful thoughts of you, distracting your target and rendering that
      creature vulnerable to your attacks. An affected creature takes a penalty
      equal to half your caster level on concentration checks and to its CMD
      against dirty trickAPG, grapple, and stealAPG combat maneuvers you
      perform. The creature is also denied its Dexterity bonus to AC for the
      first melee attack you make against it each round. If the target would not
      normally be sexually attracted to you, it receives a +4 bonus on its
      saving throw. If you end your turn more than 20 feet from the target or
      end your turn where your target cannot see you, this spell immediately
      ends.</p>
