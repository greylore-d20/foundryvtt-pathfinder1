  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist can spend two uses of his daily bombs to create a special
      bomb that is manually detonated. When the bomb is created, the alchemist
      also creates a catalyst distillate, which requires no extra time or cost.
      A remote bomb is inert unless triggered by this distillate. The bomb is
      detonated as a standard action when the distillate fumes are exposed to
      the rest of the bomb. An alchemist must be within 60 feet of the bomb for
      the distillate to successfully trigger the bomb. A catalyst distillate can
      detonate a bomb even if the bomb has already been hurled at a target.
      Triggering the distillate outside of the 60-foot range or after 1 hour has
      no effect.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
