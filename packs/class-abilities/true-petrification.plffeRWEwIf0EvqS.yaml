    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you can use your gaze bloodline ability to permanently
      turn a creature to stone, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.361rc74674l3zt9a]{Flesh to Stone}. You can still
      use the less powerful versions of your gaze if you do not wish to turn the
      target to stone, but you must declare this at the time of the attack.</p>
