    value: >-
      <p>The spell forces the target to believe that nothing in its hoard is
      missing or has been disturbed. This spell fools all the senses, convincing
      the target that its hoard feels and behaves as it should. Only if the
      target tries to use an item from this illusory hoard for some other
      purpose does it receive another saving throw to disbelieve the effects of
      the spell (a wizard trying to use an illusory wand or a dragon trying to
      unlock a door with an illusory key). For the purposes of this spell, a
      hoard is any amount of treasure that is too big to be carried by the
      treasure's owner without magical tools such as <i>bags of holding</i> or
      <i>portable holes</i>, such as a dragon's hoard, a king's treasury, a
      merchant's strongbox, or a thief's hidden cache.  The material component
      is any item worth 10 gp or more taken from the original hoard. This item
      is consumed by the spell.</p>
