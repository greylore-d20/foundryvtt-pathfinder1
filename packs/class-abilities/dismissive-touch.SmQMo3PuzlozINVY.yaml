      <p>At 8th level, you can cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.k3zn13pbr5tr9zac]{Dismissal} once per day as a
      spell-like ability (caster level equal to your inquisitor level) upon
      making a successful unarmed touch attack against an evil outsider. The DC
      to save against this ability increases by 2.</p>
