    value: >-
      <p>Drawing upon the spiritual link between a corpse and its killer, you
      reach out across space to brand the killer of the corpse you used as a
      focus for this spell, creating a physical manifestation of the killer's
      guilt.  The killer's right hand becomes stained indelibly red, and this
      stain can't be removed (although it can be hidden by magical or mundane
      means, such as <i>disguise self</i> or by wearing gloves). If the killer
      is not humanoid, or doesn't have a right hand for some other reason, the
      spell instead causes a red stain in the shape of a hand to appear
      elsewhere on the creature's body (typically on the chest).  This spell
      affects only the creature that directly killed the targeted corpse. Other
      individuals that contributed to the target's death are unaffected, and if
      the victim did not die from violence or died indirectly (for instance, if
      the creature died from suffocating after someone trapped it in a room
      filling with water), then the spell has no effect. The killer can attempt
      a Will save to resist the spell's effects. Distance is not a factor, but
      the killer must be on the same plane as you at the time you cast the
      spell, or the spell fails. Once a corpse has acted as the focus for <i>Red
      Hand of the Killer</i>, it can never act as the focus for another casting
      of <i>Red Hand of the Killer</i>.</p>
