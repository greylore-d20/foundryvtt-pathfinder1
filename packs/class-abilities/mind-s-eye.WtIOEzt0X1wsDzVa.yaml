  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Some psychics train their visual and psychic senses, binding them
      together into a unified focus to better guide their ranged spells and
      place them with uncanny precision. While casting a spell that requires a
      ranged attack roll, the psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool
      and gain a +4 insight bonus on the attack roll.</p>

      <p>The psychic can spend 1 additional point to ignore penalties from cover
      (but not total cover).</p>
