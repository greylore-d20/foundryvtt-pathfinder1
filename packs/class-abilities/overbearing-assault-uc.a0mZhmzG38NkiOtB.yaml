    value: >-
      <p>The monk attacks relentlessly, backing his foe into a corner. If the
      attack hits, the monk can perform a free reposition combat maneuver
      against the target of the strike (using the base attack bonus of the
      attack used to hit the foe) with a â€“5 penalty. This reposition attempt
      does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
