      Groups</b> Blades, Heavy</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This heavy blade has a
      single sharp edge, concave at the bottom and convex at the top, with a
      hook-shaped hilt. Its shape distributes the weight to give it the momentum
      of an axe with the cutting edge of a sword, much like a larger version of
      a kukri. The hooked hilt is sometimes carved to resemble the head of a
      horse or bird of prey, and may have a thin chain stretched across its
      opening, acting as a partial guard for the hand and fingers.</p>
