      <p>This functions as <i>psychic crush I</i>, but on a successful Fortitude
      save, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point of  damage per
      caster level. In addition, the target receives a +4 circumstance bonus on
      the Fortitude save only if it is at full hit points; otherwise, it gains a
      +2 bonus if it has more than half its total hit points remaining. This
      spell can be undercast.</p>
