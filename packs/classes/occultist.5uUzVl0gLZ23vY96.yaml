      <p>The occultist focuses on the world around him, grounded in the powers
      that flow throughout his environment. He studies the magic that infuses
      everything, from psychic resonances left in everyday items to powerful
      incantations that fuel the mightiest spells.</p>

      <p>The occultist channels his psychic might through implements—items that
      allow him to focus his power and produce incredible effects. For him,
      implements are more than simple tools. They are a repository of history
      and a tie to the events of the past. The occultist uses these implements
      to influence and change the present, adding his legend to theirs. Though
      some of these implements might be magic items in their own right, most of
      them are merely of historical or personal significance to the
      occultist.</p>

      <p><b>Role:</b> Occultists are always eager to travel in the company of
      adventurers, explorers, and archaeologists, as those three groups of
      people have a knack for finding items with rich histories and great
      significance.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment:</b> Any.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die:</b> d8.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>
