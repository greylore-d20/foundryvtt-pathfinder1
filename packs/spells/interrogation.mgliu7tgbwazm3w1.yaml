      <p>You question the target, backed up by the threat of magical pain. You
      may ask one question per two caster levels. The target can either answer
      the question or take 1d4 points of damage plus your Wisdom bonus. The
      target is not compelled to answer truthfully, but the threat of pain gives
      it a -4 penalty on Bluff checks to convince you when it is lying.</p>
