  shortDescription: >-
    <p>As a way to befuddle your target, you fill its mind with all manner of
    swirling images as well as baffling and incoherent thoughts, making the
    target an ineffective combatant and rendering its spellcasting and other
    such abilities much more feeble.  For the spell's duration, the DCs of all
    of the target's spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and
    extraordinary abilities are reduced by 4. Any of its attacks that would deal
    hit point damage, including its melee and ranged physical attacks, deal
    minimum damage for the duration of this spell.  This curse applies only to
    effects created by the creature while this spell is actively affecting the
    target; applying or removing this curse doesn't alter the ongoing damage of
    effects previously created by the target (such as an <i>incendiary cloud</i>
    spell that was cast before the target became affected by this spell).</p>
