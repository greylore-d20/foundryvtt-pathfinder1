Samurai who follow the order of the warrior are among the most trusted and feared warriors in the land.<br><br><strong>Edicts:</strong> The samurai must protect the life and lands of his lord with his life. He must be truthful and courageous, respectful to his elders and his masters, and loyal to his friends and liege. He must conduct himself with honor and dignity.<br><br><strong>Challenge</strong>: Whenever an order of the warrior samurai declares a challenge, he receives damage reduction 1/â€” against attacks made by the target of his challenge. This DR increases by +1 for every four levels the samurai possesses.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the warrior samurai adds Knowledge (history) (Int) and Knowledge (nobility) (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the warrior samurai can make Knowledge (nobility) checks untrained.
