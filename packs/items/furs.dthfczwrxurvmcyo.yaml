      <p>The most basic of cold-weather gear, animal furs serve to keep their
      wearers warm. Wearing enough fur to cover the body provides a +2 bonus on
      <em>Fortitude</em> saves to resist cold weather. This does not stack with
      any bonuses gained from the <em>Survival</em> skill.</p>
