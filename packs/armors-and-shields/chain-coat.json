      "value": "<p>This relatively simple armor consists of heavy chains that wrap around your body and limbs. While it weighs more and provides less protection than other medium armors, it is also less of a hindrance. In addition, if you are wielding a spiked chain, you can affix it to one hand. This functions as a locked gauntlet, and if you are proficient with spiked chains, you can treat the spiked chain as a one-handed weapon while it is attached. You can affix a spiked chain to each hand this way, but you can’t wear locked gauntlets while wearing a chain coat, and you can’t attach any weapon to a chain coat except spiked chains.</p>"
