  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome
      blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller.
      If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the
      brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike,
      it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler’s choice, and
      it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line,
      and the opponent can’t move closer to the brawler than the square it
      started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move,
      the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the
      opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike
      the <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Awesome%20Blow">Awesome
      Blow</a> monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this
      ability.)</p>
