      <p>Necrotic energy permeates the target, blocking healing
      abilities.</p><p>The subject gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your
      caster level against effects that restore hit points or grant temporary
      hit points. In addition, any healing provided by effects that ignore spell
      resistance (such as fast healing, regeneration, and some spells) are
      halved. If the target succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw, <i>fester</i>
      lasts only a single round.</p>
