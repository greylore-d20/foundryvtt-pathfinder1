Any living creature except its summoner that approaches within 20 feet or begins its turn in that area is sickened for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s HD + its Con modifier). Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same eidolon’s sickening effect for 24 hours.</p>"
