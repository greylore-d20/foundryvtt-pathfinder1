    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell sequesters the targets' ability for higher reasoning, allowing their darker impulses to come to the fore. An affected target becomes a ravening monster-savage, bloodthirsty, and brutish. Until the spell ends, the targets have all of the following benefits and drawbacks.  <ul><li> Targets' Intelligence and Charisma scores drop to 3 (if the scores were higher), and they are unable to use Intelligence-or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently.  <li> Targets take a -4 penalty on Will saves.  <li> Targets gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, and 2d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear at the end of the spell's duration. </ul> When the spell ends, each affected creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.</p>",
