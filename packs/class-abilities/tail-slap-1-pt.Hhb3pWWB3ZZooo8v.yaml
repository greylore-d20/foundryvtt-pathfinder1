  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon can use its tail to bash nearby foes, granting it a tail
      slap attack. This attack is a secondary attack. The tail slap deals 1d6
      points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). The eidolon must possess the
      tail evolution to take this evolution.</p>

      <p>This evolution can be selected more than once, but the eidolon must
      possess an equal number of the tail evolution.</p>
