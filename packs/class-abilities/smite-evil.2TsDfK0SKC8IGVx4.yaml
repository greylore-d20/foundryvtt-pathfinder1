  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her
      in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one
      target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the paladin adds her
      <em>Cha</em> bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level
      to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of
      smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon,
      or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack
      increases to 2 points of damage per level the paladin possesses.
      Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any
      <em>DR</em> the creature might possess.</p>

      <p>In addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a
      deflection bonus equal to her <em>Charisma</em> modifier (if any) to her
      <em>AC</em> against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the
      paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no
      effect.</p>

      <p>The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or
      the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of this ability. At
      4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the paladin may smite
      evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: Paladin, to a
      maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.</p>
