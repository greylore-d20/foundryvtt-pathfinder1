    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, as an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll
      that you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed. You
      must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original
      roll. You can use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one
      additional time per day for every six cleric levels beyond 6th.</p>
