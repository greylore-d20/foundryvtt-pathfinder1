  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You enclose the target in a thin sheath of lead. This doesn't restrict
    the target's movement or functionality, but protects it from the effects of
    radiation and prevents the penetration of many divination spells. The lead
    doesn't coat the target's equipment.</p>
