  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to turn into a twisted,
      treelike shape for 2 rounds. The target gains hardness 5 but is staggered,
      and can negate the effect with a successful Fortitude saving throw.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the target succeeds at its save, it canâ€™t be the target
      of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
