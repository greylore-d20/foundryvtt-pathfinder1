  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, as a <em>move action</em>, you can extend roots into the
      ground. Your <em>speed</em> is reduced to 5 feet, but you gain a +4 bonus
      to <em>natural armor</em> and a +10 bonus to <em>CMD</em> against <em>bull
      rush</em>, <em>overrun</em>, <em>reposition</em>, and <em>trip</em>
      maneuvers. You also gain <em>tremorsense</em> 30 feet and <em>fast
      healing</em> 1. You can use this power for a number of minutes per day
      equal to your sorcerer level. This duration need not be consecutive, but
      it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
