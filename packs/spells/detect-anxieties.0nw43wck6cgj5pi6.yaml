      <p>This spell functions as <i>detect thoughts</i> except that you sense
      significant anxieties of creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or
      higher, regardless of whether they are conscious or not.  Instead of
      Intelligence, the second round of concentration reveals each mind's Wisdom
      score and current degree of fear (shaken, frightened, panicked, cowering,
      or paralyzed with fear). If the highest Wisdom score is 26 or higher (and
      at least 10 points higher than your own Wisdom score), you are stunned for
      1 round and the spell ends.  Instead of surface thoughts, the third round
      of concentration reveals the most pressing current anxiety of any mind in
      the area (Will negates).  Presenting a creature with the threat of its
      anxiety grants you a +2 bonus (or higher, at the GM's discretion) on
      checks to Intimidate that creature.</p>
