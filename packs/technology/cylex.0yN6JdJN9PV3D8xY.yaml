      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      none</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> -; <strong>Usage</strong>
      disposable</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Cylex is an exceptionally stable form
      of explosive that can be shaped at room temperature, like soft clay. Neon
      green in color, a single charge of cylex can be triggered to explode by
      using a detonator (see below) or applying 10 or more points of electricity
      damage to it in a single action. When detonated, a single use of cylex
      explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage and 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in the
      area of effect. A successful DC 17 Reflex saving throw halves the
      damage.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 26;
