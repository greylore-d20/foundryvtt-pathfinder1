      <p>You open the minds of all creatures near you and enhance their sensory
      receptors. All living creatures other than you in the area gain a +5 bonus
      on Perception checks. Sighted creatures gain low-light vision, and
      creatures with a sense of smell gain scent. In addition, the first time
      each round that a creature in the area takes damage, it takes an
      additional 2d6 points of damage of the same type. Despite being within the
      area, the caster does not take this extra damage.</p>
