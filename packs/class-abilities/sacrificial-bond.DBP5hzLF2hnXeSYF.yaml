  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, when an ally within 30 feet takes damage from an attack,
      you can, as an immediate action, transfer this damage to yourself. This
      power also transfers any effects that accompany the damage. The damage
      done to you cannot be reduced in any way. You can use this ability once
      per day at 8th level, plus on additional time per day at 14th level and
      20th level.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Leadership power of the Nobility Domain.</p>
