  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you develop a sixth sense that helps you avoid traps. You
      gain a +2 bonus on <em>Perception</em> checks made to notice traps. You
      also gain a +1 bonus on <em>Reflex</em> saves to avoid traps and a +1
      <em>dodge bonus</em> to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses
      increase by +1 at 7th level and for every four <em>sorcerer</em> levels
      you gain thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). This bonus stacks
      with that provided by a <em>rogueâ€™s</em> <em>trap sense</em> and similar
      abilities.</p>
