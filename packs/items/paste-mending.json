      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 25 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this smelly, silvery paste to temporarily repair metal objects. It is sold in a sealed flask and reacts with air, turning solid in 1d6+4 minutes. You must make an appropriate DC 20 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a> check to repair a metal item with the broken condition; success means the object loses the broken condition but gains the fragile condition. Increase the DC by +5 if the broken object is a magic item or by +5 if it is a firearm (add both modifiers if the item is a magical firearm). If the check fails, the mending paste is consumed but you may try again with another flask or conventional repair methods.</p>\r\n"
