    value: >-
      <p>The shaman gains cold resistance 10. In addition, as a standard action,
      she can summon an icy blast in a 20-foot-radius burst originating from a
      point she can see within 30 feet. This blast deals cold damage equal to
      1d6 per shaman level she has to each creature caught in the burst. Each
      target can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve this damage.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait
      at least 1d4 rounds between each use.</p>
