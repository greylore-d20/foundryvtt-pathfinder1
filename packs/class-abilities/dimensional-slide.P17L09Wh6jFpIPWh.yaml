  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a
      dimensional crack that she can step through to reach another location.
      This ability is used as part of a move action or withdraw action, allowing
      her to move up to 10 feet per arcanist level to any location she can see.
      This counts as 5 feet of movement.</p>

      <p>She can only use this ability once per round.</p>

      <p>She does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way,
      but any other movement she attempts as part of her move action provokes as
      normal.</p>
