  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the barbarian heals 1d8 points of damage + her
      Constitution modifier. For every four levels the barbarian has attained
      above 4th, this amount of damage healed increases by 1d8, to a maximum of
      5d8 at 20th level.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.
      This power can be used only once per day and only while raging.</p>
