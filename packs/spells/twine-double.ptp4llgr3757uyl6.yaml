    value: >-
      <p>As <i>simulacrum,</i> except you can only duplicate yourself, and the
      duplicate is created from cloth and twine rather than ice and snow. The
      double looks exactly like you except its eyes are balls of twine (DC 10
      Perception check to recognize double's strange eyes). It wears clothing
      and gear that appear exactly like what you are wearing at the time of
      casting. Its copies of your magic items are nonfunctional but radiate
      magic and have the same auras as your items. Its aura is identical to
      yours. Attempts to scry you while the double exists have a 50% chance of
      targeting the double instead of you.</p><p>The double cannot attack, has
      no special abilities, and has a +0 bonus on all saves and checks. You may
      verbally give the double orders as a free action, or control it
      telepathically as a standard action. You know what the double is
      experiencing, and when controlling it telepathically you can see and hear
      everything it sees and hears, though events at your location may drown out
      the sensory inputs from the double. The double has hit points equal to
      half your hit points at the time of casting. If brought to 0 hit points,
      it is destroyed, reverting to cloth and twine. The double is an animated
      object.</p>
