The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject hits with an attack using a weapon, a natural weapon, or an unarmed strike. The attack’s target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, the target doesn’t get a saving throw.</p>"
