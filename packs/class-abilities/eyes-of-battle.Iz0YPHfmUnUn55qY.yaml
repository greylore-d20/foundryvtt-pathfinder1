    value: >-
      <p>The shamanâ€™s senses become magically heightened in the heat of battle.
      As a swift action, she can grant herself a +10 insight bonus for 1 round
      on Perception checks made to notice and pinpoint invisible creatures
      within 30 feet. She can instead use this ability as a swift action to
      ignore the effects of cover or partial cover (but not total cover) on her
      next attack, as long as that attack is made before the end of her next
      turn.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her
      shaman level.</p>
