      <p>You may only cast this spell if you currently have a familiar. You
      place your soul into the body of your familiar, and your familiar's soul
      is placed in your body. This functions as if you possessed your familiar
      using <i>magic jar</i>; your familiar simultaneously possesses your body
      in the same manner. You can't freely transfer your soul between your body
      and your familiar's-if you choose to return to your body as a standard
      action, the spell ends. If either body is killed, both spirits return to
      their original bodies, the spell ends, and the original owner of the slain
      body dies.</p>
