  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You determine whether a creature, object, or area carries any sort of
      disease or infestation (including molds, slimes, and similar hazards), or
      any exceptional or supernatural effects causing the sickened or nauseated
      effects. If there is disease present, you know what disease it is and its
      effects. If the target is a creature, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks
      to treat the creature's disease. The spell can penetrate many barriers,
      but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3
      feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>
