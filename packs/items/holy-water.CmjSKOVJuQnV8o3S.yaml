      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it
      were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash
      weapon.<br><br>Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range
      increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a
      corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you
      must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you
      can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent
      to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity.<br><br>A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points
      of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature
      within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage
      from the splash.<br><br>Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost
      (making no profit). Holy water is made using the bless water spell.</p>
