  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell makes your eyes shine blood red and allows you to see the
      vital areas and weak points of creatures within 30 feet of you as a warm
      glow. This allows you to use any manufactured weapon to make sneak
      attacks, as the rogue ability of the same name, dealing an additional 1d6
      points of damage; this additional damage increases by 1d6 for every 3
      caster levels you possess beyond 3rd, to a maximum of +5d6 at 15th level.
      This additional damage stacks with other sources of precision damage.</p>
