The broken condition has the following effects, depending upon the item.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the item is a weapon, any attacks made with the item suffer a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Such weapons only score a critical hit on a natural 20 and only deal ×2 damage on a confirmed critical hit.</li>\n<li>If the item is a suit of armor or a shield, the bonus it grants to <em>AC</em> is halved, rounding down. Broken armor doubles its armor check penalty on skills.</li>\n<li>If the item is a tool needed for a skill, any skill check made with the item takes a –2 penalty.</li>\n<li>If the item is a <em>wand</em> or staff, it uses up twice as many charges when used.</li>\n<li>If the item does not fit into any of these categories, the broken condition has no effect on its use. Items with the broken condition, regardless of type, are worth 75% of their normal value. If the item is magical, it can only be repaired with a @Compendium[pf1.spells.24zg8a05hqum3e6j]{Mending} or @Compendium[pf1.spells.x23pz2agjub1eh89]{Make Whole} spell cast by a character with a <em>caster level</em> equal to or higher than the item’s. Items lose the broken condition if the spell restores the object to half its original <em>hit points</em> or higher. Non-magical items can be repaired in a similar fashion, or through the @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.3E8pxbjI8MD3JbfQ]{Craft} skill used to create it. Generally speaking, this requires a DC 20 @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.3E8pxbjI8MD3JbfQ]{Craft} check and 1 hour of work per point of damage to be repaired. Most craftsmen charge one-tenth the item’s total cost to repair such damage (more if the item is badly damaged or ruined).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Special Note on Ships</strong>: Ships, and sometimes their means of propulsion—are objects, and like any other object, when they take damage in excess of half their <em>hit points</em>, they gain the broken condition. When a ship gains the broken condition, it takes a –2 penalty to AC, on sailing checks, saving throws, and on <em>combat maneuver</em> checks. If a ship or its means of propulsion becomes broken, the ship’s maximum speed is halved and the ship can no longer gain the upper hand until repaired. If the ship is in motion and traveling faster than its new maximum speed, it automatically decelerates to its new maximum speed (from <em>Advanced Naval Combat</em>.)</p>"

If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies.</p><h2>Energy Drain and Negative Levels</h2><p>Some spells and a number of undead creatures have the ability to drain away life and energy; this dreadful attack results in “negative levels.” These cause a character to take a number of penalties.</p><p>For each negative level a creature has, it takes a cumulative –1 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, Combat Maneuver Defense, saving throws, and skill checks. In addition, the creature reduces its current and total hit points by 5 for each negative level it possesses. The creature is also treated as one level lower for the purpose of level-dependent variables (such as spellcasting) for each negative level possessed. Spellcasters do not lose any prepared spells or slots as a result of negative levels. If a creature’s negative levels equal or exceed its total Hit Dice, it dies.</p><p>A creature with temporary negative levels receives a new saving throw to remove the negative level each day. The DC of this save is the same as the effect that caused the negative levels.</p><p>Some abilities and spells (such as <em>raise dead</em>) bestow permanent level drain on a creature. These are treated just like temporary negative levels, but they do not allow a new save each day to remove them. Level drain can be removed through spells like <em>restoration</em>. Permanent negative levels remain after a dead creature is restored to life. A creature whose permanent negative levels equal its Hit Dice cannot be brought back to life through spells like @Compendium[pf1.spells.c5anior2ysy6s2xy]{raise dead} and @Compendium[pf1.spells.thh46ghi51lrl3cl]{resurrection} without also receiving a @Compendium[pf1.spells.anya5qwdjhdfyk8u]{restoration} spell, cast the round after it is restored to life.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>Q</strong>: Does energy drain count as a death effect?<br /><strong>A</strong>:  Energy drain is not a death effect.</p><p>The undead type calls out immunities to \"death effects\" and \"energy drain\" as separate things.</p><p>The Death Attacks description in the Core Rulebook doesn't mention negative levels or energy drain.</p><p>\"Energy Drain and Negative Levels\" is an entirely separate entry in the Core Rulebook and doesn't say energy drain is a type of death attack, nor does it say that @Compendium[pf1.spells.e0rlki4hwu76l5ya]{death ward} protects against them.</p><p>The death ward spell gives a bonus against death spells and magical death effects, and goes on to say that the target is immune to energy drain, and suspends penalties from negative levels while the spell is active.</p><p>Therefore the rules treat energy drain and death effects as different things. For example, if you are immune to death effects, you aren't necessarily immune to energy drain.</p>",
