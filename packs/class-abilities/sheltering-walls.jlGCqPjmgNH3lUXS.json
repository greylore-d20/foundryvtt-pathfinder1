      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can touch an ally to summon a floating blockade of stone, granting the ally the benefits of partial cover for 1 round plus 1 round for every 6 cleric levels you possess. This ability does not grant the ally enough cover to attempt a Stealth check or avoid provoking attacks of opportunity. If the ally benefits from any other form of cover against an attack, the bonuses to AC and on Reflex saving throws increase by 1. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This pwoer replaces the Resistant Touch power of the Protection Domain.</p>"
