  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman can grant the blessings of her ancestors to any ally within
      30 feet. The blessed creature receives a +1 competence bonus on attack and
      damage rolls. This blessing lasts until the blessed creature hits with an
      attack or deals damage to a target. The shaman can have only one ancestral
      blessing active at a time. If the shaman uses this ability again, the
      previous blessing immediately ends.</p>

      <p>At 8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this blessing
      increase by 1.</p>
