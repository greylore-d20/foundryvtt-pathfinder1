    value: >-
      <p>You place a magical command upon a creature to seek out and destroy a
      single enemy that has inflicted some perceived or actual harm to the
      target. You designate the enemy at the time of casting, which must be
      known by the target (such as "your brother's murderer") or can easily
      identify by sight (such as "the hill giant king"). The target is under the
      of a <i>geas</i> to find and capture or kill this enemy, and the target
      takes the penalties of that spell as long as it is not actively trying to
      reach the enemy. When the target enters combat with the enemy, it gains a
      +6 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +3 morale bonus on Will
      saves, and is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions.</p><p>If you
      designate one of the target's friends or loved ones as the enemy, the
      target gains another saving throw to overcome the spell as soon as it
      enters combat with the enemy.</p>
