    value: >-
      <p>You cause a column of boiling water to spring forth from any horizontal
      surface, knocking over creatures directly over it and exposing nearby
      creatures to searing droplets as its spray falls back to the
      ground.</p><p>Any creature entering the <i>geyser</i>, or occupying the
      square it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid being
      hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails
      its saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire damage from the boiling
      water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the
      <i>geyser</i> (e.g., if the <i>geyser</i> is 50 feet tall, the creature
      takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to
      the <i>geyser</i>. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates
      the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square
      adjacent to the <i>geyser</i> (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved
      enough so that they are not on top of the <i>geyser</i> but still adjacent
      to it).</p><p>This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and
      does not count toward the creature's normal movement.</p><p>In addition,
      the <i>geyser</i> sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around
      its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the
      <i>geyser</i>'s height (e.g., a 50-foot <i>geyser</i> has a 25-foot-radius
      emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6
      points of fire damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on
      them.</p><p>You can choose to make a smaller <i>geyser</i> than your level
      permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if
      you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that's smaller than
      what would be created by a full-height <i>geyser</i> spell.</p>
