      <p>You ask the target creature a single question. On the subject's next
      action, it must answer truthfully in the same language as the question or
      take 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) and be
      sickened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Will save negates the sickening
      effect and halves the damage. A creature that is unable to answer still
      takes damage.</p>
