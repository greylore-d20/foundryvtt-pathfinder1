      <p>Each metal bit of this suit of +1
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.armors-and-shields.Item.xeuREriTfdZR1yCD]{studded
      leather} looks more like a tiny sneering face than a simple stud. Once per
      day the wearer of the armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent of
      verbal abuse directed against every hostile creature within 60 feet who
      can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will
      saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the
      wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the
      wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at
      risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on)
      it can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and
      has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken
      language.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong>
