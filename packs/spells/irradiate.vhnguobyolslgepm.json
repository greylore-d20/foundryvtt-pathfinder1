The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally per the rules for radiation areas of effect (see page 55). Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The save to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell, not the standard save DC for radiation.</p><p>Caster <b>Level</b> Radiation <b>Level</b> 6th or lower Low 7th-9th Medium 10th-16th High 17th or higher Severe</p>"
