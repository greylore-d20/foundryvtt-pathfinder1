      <p>You constrain the target such that the target automatically misses with
      all attacks made against creatures that are not of the opposite alignment
      of it. For example, a lawful evil target would automatically fail at all
      attacks except those made against chaotic good creatures, and a neutral
      good target would automatically fail at all attacks except those made
      against neutral evil creatures. For the purposes of <i>antithetical
      constraint</i>, creatures that are chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful
      evil, or lawful good are all considered to have the opposite alignment of
      a target whose alignment is neutral with no other alignment components.
      This restriction doesn't apply to effects that do not require attack
      rolls, such as <i>magic missile</i>.</p>
