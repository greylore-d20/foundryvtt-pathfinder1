  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Invisible layers of solid force surround and protect the target, granting
    that target a +2 armor bonus to AC. Additionally, the first 5 points of
    lethal damage the target takes from each attack are converted into nonlethal
    damage. Against attacks that already deal nonlethal damage, the target gains
    DR 5/-. Once this spell has converted 5 points of damage to nonlethal damage
    per caster level (maximum 50 points), the spell is discharged.</p>
