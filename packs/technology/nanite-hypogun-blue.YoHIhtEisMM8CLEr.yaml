          The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms,
          legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones,
          and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical
          regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present
          and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.  Regenerate
          also cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
          +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all
          nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving
          creatures (including undead).

      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      none</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> 1 nanite canister;
      <strong>Usage</strong> 1 charge or 5
      charges</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Nanite hypoguns inject specialized
      nanites into a creature's body to heal many sorts of physical and mental
      injuries. Injecting someone with a nanite hypogun requires a touch attack.
      Nine categories of nanite hypogun exist along the color code scale, as
      detailed below. All nanite hypoguns have two settings. On the primary
      setting, the hypogun heals an amount of hit point damage determined by its
      color. Each use of a hypogun on its primary setting consumes 1 charge. On
      the secondary setting, a dose from a nanite hypogun has a different effect
      determined by its color-these effects mimic specific restorative spells as
      indicated on the chart below. Each use of a hypogun on its secondary
      setting consumes 5 charges. Although they are not magical, nanite hypoguns
      have an effective caster level for the purposes of determining the potency
      of their effects as required by special circumstances (such as determining
      if a disease is cured, or if damage caused by a clay golem's cursed wound
      ability can be healed).</p><p>A nanite hypogun functions only on a living,
      corporeal creature. It has no effect on undead creatures
      whatsoever.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Primary
