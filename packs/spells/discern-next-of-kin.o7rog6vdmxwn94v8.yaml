    value: >-
      <p>You can scan the thoughts of one individual and learn the names and
      locations of the target's living relatives, as well as the attitude of the
      target toward those relatives (and vice versa). You learn about one
      relative per round you concentrate on the target. For example, you might
      learn that the target's father's name is Jarn, the father lives on a
      nearby farm, and the target and his father don't get along.</p><p>Since
      this spell reads the target's mind, you can learn only what the target
      knows or believes.</p>
