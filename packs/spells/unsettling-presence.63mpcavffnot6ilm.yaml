  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Those in this spell's area who fail their Will saving throws harbor a
    faint sense of paranoia and evoke the same feeling in others for the
    duration of the spell. Domesticated animals (not including familiars and
    animal companions) don't willingly approach affected creatures unless the
    animal's master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy
    check. Affected creatures take a -4 penalty on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild
    empathy checks against familiars, animal companions, animal cohorts, and
    other permanent companions provided by class abilities for the spell's
    duration. Anyone an affected creature interacts with must succeed at a Will
    save or have its initial attitude automatically worsened by one step for the
    spell's duration. Every time an affected creature attempts a Sense Motive
    check to get a hunch or detect a Bluff from another creature (or vice
    versa), it must succeed at a Will save or automatically assume the other
    party is lying or otherwise harbors ill will against it. Each time this
    spell causes an affected creature (or someone interacting with the affected
    creature) to attempt a Will saving throw, the spell's hauntlike
    manifestation occurs.</p>
