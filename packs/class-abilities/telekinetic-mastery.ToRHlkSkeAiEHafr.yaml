  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to grant
      yourself telekinetic power. This functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.3lfx1ccxo2hdqrf3]{Telekinesis}, except you donâ€™t
      need to concentrate on the effect to maintain it, and using any one of its
      effects is a standard action. This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist
      level you possess.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.</p>
