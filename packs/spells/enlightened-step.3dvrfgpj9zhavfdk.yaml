  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Through careful regulation of your body's mystical energies, thoughtful
    control of your poise and balance, and the focus in your mind on the surety
    of each and every step you take, you are able to make your steps lighter
    than air. This grants you the benefits of <i>air walk</i>, except as noted
    above. Additionally, at any time during the spell's duration, you can expend
    the spell's remaining duration as a swift action in order to gain a fly
    speed of 120 feet with perfect maneuverability for 1 minute. After this
    time, the spell ends.</p>
