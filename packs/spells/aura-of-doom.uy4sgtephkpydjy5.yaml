      <p>You emanate an almost palpable aura of horror. All non-allies within
      this spell's area, or that later enter the area, must make a Will save to
      avoid becoming shaken. A successful save suppresses the effect. Creatures
      that leave the area and come back must save again to avoid being affected
      by the effect.</p>
