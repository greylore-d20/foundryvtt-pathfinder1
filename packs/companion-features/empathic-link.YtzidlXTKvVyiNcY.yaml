  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance.
      The master can communicate emphatically with the familiar, but cannot see
      through its eyes. Because of the linkâ€™s limited nature, only general
      emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or
      place that his familiar does.</p>
