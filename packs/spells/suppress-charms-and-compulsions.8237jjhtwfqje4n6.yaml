      <p>You bolster the subject's sense of willpower and self-worth when you
      cast this spell. As you cast it, you must decide if you want to grant a
      bonus to saving throws against charms and compulsions or Suppress Charms
      and Compulsions. If you grant a bonus to saving throws, you grant all
      affected creatures a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and
      compulsion effects for 10 minutes. If instead you Suppress Charms and
      Compulsions, the spell's duration drops to concentration, to a maximum
      duration of 1 round per level. As long as you continue to concentrate, the
      spell suppresses all existing charm and compulsion effects affecting the
      targets, regardless of whether the effect is beneficial or harmful. New
      charm or compulsion effects that successfully target such a protected
      creature are automatically suppressed as long as you continue
      concentrating. If you cease concentrating, the spell effect immediately
      ends, and remaining charm or compulsion effects resume for the rest of
      their remaining durations as normal.</p>
