  shortDescription: >-
    <p>When you cast this spell, a wind spirit envelopes you and carries you
    with it at your direction. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your
    base speed and fly speed while this spell is in effect. If you don't have a
    fly speed, you instead gain a fly speed of 10 feet with poor
    maneuverability. If your caster level is 10thâ€“14th, the enhancement bonus to
    these speeds is +20 feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 20 feet
    with average maneuverability). If your caster level is 15th or higher, the
    enhancement bonus to these speeds is +30 feet (if applicable, your temporary
    fly speed is 30 feet with average maneuverability).</p>
