  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell transforms water into an alcoholic beverage, typically ale,
    beer, mead, or wine. The alcohol is of middling quality but perfectly
    drinkable. The spell also serves to remove poisons, diseases, minerals, and
    other toxins from the water as it transforms. The more contaminants that
    exist in the water, the darker the ale or the more full-bodied the wine
    becomes. The beverage's alcohol content is not affected by the presence or
    absence of contaminants.</p><p>This spell does not work on unholy water,
    potions, or other liquids with magical power.</p>
