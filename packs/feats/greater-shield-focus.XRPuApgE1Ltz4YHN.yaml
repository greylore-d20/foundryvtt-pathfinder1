      <p><em>You are skilled at deflecting blows with your
      shield.</em><p><b>Prerequisites</b><br>Shield Focus, Shield Proficiency,
      base attack bonus +1, 8th-level fighter.<p><b>Benefits</b><br>Increase the
      AC bonus granted by any shield you are using by 1. This bonus stacks with
      the bonus granted by Shield Focus.<p><b>Combat Trick</b><br>When an attack
      is made against you while you are using a shield, you can spend up to 4
      stamina points. For that attack, your shield bonus increases by an amount
      equal to the number of stamina points you spent. This increase does not
      stack with any gained from the Shield Focus combat trick.</p>

      <p><b>Usage</b>: add 1 to Armor Class to any shield in your inventory.</p>
