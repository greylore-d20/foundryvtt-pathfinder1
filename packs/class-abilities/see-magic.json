      "value": "<p>The arcanist can see magical auras. If she expends 1 point from her arcane reservoir, for 1 minute she instantly recognizes magic item auras and spell effects (as @Compendium[pf1.spells.uqh87jz757r2cb7r]{Detect Magic}). During this time, she is treated as if she had studied each aura for 3 rounds and she treats her Knowledge (arcana) skill check as if she had rolled a 15 on the d20. In addition, if she touches a magic item during this time, she can immediately identify its properties using Spellcraft without needing to spend 3 rounds examining the object. If an enemy possesses the object, the arcanist must first succeed at a melee touch attack to identify the item.</p>"
