  shortDescription: >-
    <p>At the sight of an injured ally, the target immediately disengages from
    its current course of action and rushes to provide aid. If the target
    possesses curative spells or magic items, it utilizes them to help the
    injured ally. If not, the target provides aid by performing a Heal check.
    The target remains with the injured ally to assure her safety and refuses to
    leave the ally's side until her wounds are fully treated or the spell ends,
    but can otherwise defend itself and make attacks.</p>
