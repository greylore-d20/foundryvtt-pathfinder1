    value: >-
      <p>A rogue who selects this talent gains Improved Dirty Trick as a bonus
      feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, she is
      treated as if she meets all the prerequisites for Greater Dirty Trick
      (although she must take the feat as normal). If she succeeds in giving her
      target the blinded condition, the target cannot remove the condition
      during the first round of blindness.</p>
