  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You cast this spell immediately before you would take an action that
      requires a d20 roll, such as a skill check, attack roll, or ability check.
      The action must be something you can complete in a single round. The spell
      magically informs you whether the action will succeed if you roll a 10 or
      better on the d20 roll involved. If the action would be successful under
      those circumstances, you must take the action. If the action would not be
      successful, you can take a different action.</p>
