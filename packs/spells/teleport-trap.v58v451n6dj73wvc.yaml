      <p><i>Teleport trap</i> wards an area, redirecting all teleportation into
      or out of the area to a specific point within the area determined by you
      at the time of casting. The destination must be an open space on a solid
      surface. The spell's area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid
      objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into
      a wall or through similar means). A teleporting creature that is affected
      by a <i>teleport trap</i> can resist the effect with a Will save-if the
      save is successful, the creature simply doesn't teleport at all (but the
      use of the teleport effect is still consumed)-either to the intended
      location or the <i>teleport trap</i>'s actual destination. A DC 27
      Knowledge (arcana) allows such a creature to recognize the <i>teleport
      trap</i>'s presence, but does not reveal the trap's linked
      destination.</p><p>At your discretion, the <i>teleport trap</i> can
      exclude a category of creatures, such as an alignment, a type of creature,
      or creatures that carry a specific item or know a password (though this
      only works if the creature is teleporting out of the area, not into it).
      You select this option and the conditions at the time you cast the spell.
      Overly complicated conditions may cause the spell to fail entirely.
      Multiple castings of <i>teleport trap</i> can be linked to cover a larger
      area, allowing teleported creatures to be directed to a single point
      within the combined area of the spells.</p><p><i>Teleport trap</i> can be
      made permanent at the cost of 7,000 gp. A single <i>permanency</i> spell
      can be used on all <i>teleport trap</i>s that share a linked destination,
      but the gold piece cost must be paid for each individual spell.</p><p>The
      Pathfinders of the Grand Lodge make use of permanent <i>teleport trap</i>s
      in several key locations, trapping would-be intruders in a small wing of
      jail cells. At least one crypt of the Whispering Tyrant makes use of the
      spell as well, trapping grave robbers in coffin-sized stone cysts, there
      to die a slow and agonizing death from thirst and starvation.</p>
