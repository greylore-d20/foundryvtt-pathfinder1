      <p>Sugar lemons make prized preserves when ground, salted, and sealed in
      jars, adding an intense citrus flavor when sprinkled atop other foods. If,
      within 8 hours of consuming a <em>meal</em> seasoned with Sugar lemons,
      you gain the <em>confused</em> condition, you can roll 1d6 and subtract
      the result from the result of your d% roll to determine what action you
      take for the first round in which you are <em>confused</em>. This benefit
      does not stack with itself.</p><p>The price and weight listed represent a
      jar containing enough preserved lemons to season 10 meals.</p>
