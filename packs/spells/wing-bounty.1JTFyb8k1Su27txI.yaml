  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your wings sprout a variety of colorful and flavorful berries. Each
      berry functions as if affected by
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.k4whhwm1dsz2upkm]{goodberry}. You can choose for
      one affected berry to also be poisonous (as striped toadstool); only you
      and druids of 5th level or higher can tell which is which without
      magic.</p>
