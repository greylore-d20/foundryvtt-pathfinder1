  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>fireball</i>, except that it is more
    powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The burst
    of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
    The glowing bead created by <i>delayed blast fireball</i> can detonate
    immediately if you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for as many
    as 5 rounds. You select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and
    that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone touches the
    bead. If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until
    it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon
    (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1
    round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while
    being handled.</p>
