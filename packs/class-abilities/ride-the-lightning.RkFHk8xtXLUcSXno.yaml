  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, as a <em>full-round action</em> you can become a living
      lightning bolt and move in a straight line up to 10 times your
      <em>speed</em>. You do not provoke <em>attacks of opportunity</em> while
      moving in this way. Creatures or objects in your path are affected as by
      your thunderbolt power. Creatures do not block your movement but solid
      barriers do unless they are reduced to 0 <em>hit points</em>. You can use
      this power once per day for a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer
      level.</p>
