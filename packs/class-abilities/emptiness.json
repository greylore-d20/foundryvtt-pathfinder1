You gain negative energy resistance 2, a 5% chance to ignore critical hits and sneak attacks, and a +1 bonus on Will saves against emotion effects.</p>\n<p>By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the resistance to negative energy by 2, the chance to ignore critical hits and sneak attacks by 5%, and the bonus on Will saves against emotion effects by 1 until the next time your burn is removed. The chance of ignoring critical hits and sneak attacks granted by this wild talent stacks with the chance granted by elemental overflow to a maximum of 100%.</p>\n<p>When you accept burn while using a void wild talent, your bonus on Will saves applies against all mind-affecting effects for 1 round. You can dismiss and restore this effect as an immediate action.</p>"
