      <p>Your kinetic blast is so bright that it blinds your foes. Whenever an
      infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe
      must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 round, regardless of
      whether it takes damage from the blast. You can reduce the blastâ€™s damage
      by half to increase the DC of this save by 2.</p>
