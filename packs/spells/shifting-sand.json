    "shortDescription": "<p>You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the area. The <i>shifting sand</i> obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the <i>shifting sand</i> must make a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws.</p><p>As a move action, you may move the area of <i>shifting sand</i> up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or prone in the spell's area are carried along with the <i>shifting sand</i> in the same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects may also be carried along or shallowly buried by the <i>shifting sand</i>.</p>",
