    value: >-
      <p>This special sense allows a creature to detect approaching enemies,
      sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the
      scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar
      sights.</p><p>The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of
      smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if
      downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting
      garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering
      scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple
      the normal range.</p><p>When a creature detects a scent, the exact
      location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within
      range. The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the
      scent. When the creature is within 5 feet of the source, it pinpoints the
      source’s location.</p><p>A creature with the scent ability can follow
      tracks by smell, attempting a Wisdom or Survival check to find or follow a
      track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of
      surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how
      strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the
      trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2.
      Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and
      poor visibility. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival
      skill.</p><p><em>Format:</em> scent</p><p><em>Location:</em> Senses.</p>
