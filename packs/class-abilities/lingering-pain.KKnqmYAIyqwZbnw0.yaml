  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as an immediate
      action after hitting a target with a weapon attack. All damage from that
      attack (including damage from a spell cast using the spellstrike ability)
      is considered continuous damage for the purposes of any concentration
      checks made by the target prior to the beginning of the magusâ€™s next
      turn.</p>
