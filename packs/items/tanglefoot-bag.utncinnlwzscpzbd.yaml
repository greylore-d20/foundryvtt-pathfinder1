      <p>A tanglefoot bag is a small sack filled with tar, resin, and other
      sticky substances. When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a
      ranged <em>touch attack</em> with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag
      comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming
      tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An <em>entangled</em> creature
      takes a -2 penalty on <em>attack rolls</em> and a -4 penalty to
      <em>Dexterity</em> and must make a DC 15 <em>Reflex</em> save or be glued
      to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only
      at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot
      bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15
      <em>Reflex</em> save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to
      fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function
      underwater.</p><p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly)
      can break free by making a DC 17 <em>Strength</em> check or by dealing 15
      points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to
      scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to
      make an <em>attack roll</em>; hitting the goo is automatic, after which
      the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was
      scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half
      speed. If the <em>entangled</em> creature attempts to cast a spell, it
      must make <em>concentration</em> check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level
      or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after
      2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of
      <em>universal solvent</em> to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical
      goo immediately.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft
