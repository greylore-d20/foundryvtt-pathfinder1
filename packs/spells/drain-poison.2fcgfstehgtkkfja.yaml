  shortDescription: >-
    <p>By touching a weapon against the fang of a poisonous creature and casting
    this spell, you drain 1 dose of the creature's poison, which is magically
    applied to your weapon without risk of poisoning yourself. The poison
    remains on the weapon until either it strikes a creature, you touch the
    weapon, or you wipe off the poison. It otherwise functions exactly like a
    dose of a manufactured poison applied to a weapon. You can use this spell
    with natural as well as manufactured weapons. This spell does not prevent
    you from exposing yourself to the poison if you roll a natural 1 on an
    attack roll while the poison is applied to your weapon.  The spell has no
    effect if the creature whose fang is touched is a summoned creature, if it
    has been dead for more than 1 minute, or if its poison has already been
    extracted from it.</p>
