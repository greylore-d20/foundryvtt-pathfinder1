    value: >-
      <p>The targeted creature becomes susceptible to a repeat use of your
      harmful hexes, even if you could not otherwise target that creature with a
      particular hex for a certain time period. For example, normally after you
      target a creature with a charm hex, you cannot target it again for 1 day.
      But after casting this spell on a creature, you could try the charm hex
      repeatedly as long as the spell persists. The end of this spell has no
      effect on any active or ongoing hex on a creature. Fox example, if the
      creature failed its save against a second use of your charm hex, it
      remains charmed for the normal duration, even if the spell expires before
      the hex does.  Each subsequent casting of this spell on a target within a
      24-hour period gives the target a +4 bonus on its save against the spell
      and imposes a -4 penalty on your caster level check to overcome the
      target's spell resistance with this spell.</p>
