      "value": "<p>At 15th level, once per day when he challenges a Large or larger creature, the cavalier can also prepare to interrupt the creature’s special attacks. The challenged target provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier whenever it activates an extraordinary or a supernatural attack (such as a breath weapon or gaze attack). If the cavalier deals damage with this attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the cavalier’s level + his Charisma modifier) or it fails to activate the special attack and loses the action it took to do so. The cavalier can perform three such attacks of opportunity over the course of a counterstriking challenge.</p>"
