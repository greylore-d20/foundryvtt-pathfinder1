      <p>All creatures within the area gain the effects of a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.skgjjub1hng29nwo]{Protection from Evil}
      spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures
      in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to
      suppress effects that are controlling them.</p><p>If successful, such
      effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that
      leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a
      creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third
      function of <em>Protection from Evil</em>), but the deflection and
      resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless
      of enemies' spell resistance.</p><p>This spell has an alternative version
      that you may choose when casting it. A <em>magic circle against evil</em>
      can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell
      binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <em>lesser
      planar binding</em>, <em>planar binding</em>, and <em>greater planar
      binding</em> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided
      that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting
      the <em>magic circle</em>. The creature cannot cross the circle's
      boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the
      subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <em>Protection from
      Evil</em> spell for that creature only.</p><p>A <em>magic circle</em>
      leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid
      down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately
      ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle,
      directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature
      has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to
      overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the
      circle.</p><p>A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral
      projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow
      walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through
      such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by
      casting a <em>dimensional anchor</em> spell on it, but you must cast the
      spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <em>anchor</em>
      effect lasts as long as the <em>magic circle</em> does. The creature
      cannot reach across the <em>magic circle</em>, but its ranged attacks
      (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The
      creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except
      for the circle itself.</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a
      two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference,
      augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <em>magic circle</em>
      more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a
      DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the
      check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the
      diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the
      task.</p><p>This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at
      all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take
      20.</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <em>dimensional
      anchor</em> spell on the <em>magic circle</em> during the round before
      casting any summoning spell. The <em>anchor</em> holds any called
      creatures in the <em>magic circle</em> for 24 hours per caster level. A
      creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <em>magic circle</em>
      prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross
      the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the
      trap (see the <em>lesser planar binding</em> spell), the DC increases by
      5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the
      diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb
      the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p><p>This
      spell is not cumulative with <em>Protection from Evil</em> and vice
      versa.</p>
