Ghost ink is most often used to blaze trails and mark locations in a subtle manner. The pigment shines with a warm red glow under the light shed by <em>fire beetle</em> glands and sunrods, but under optimal normal conditions (such as a pale surface like parchment or a plaster wall) can only be noticed with a successful DC 25 <em>Perception</em> check. One vial of ghost ink is the size of a potion vial and sufficient for writing a page's worth of characters.</p>"
