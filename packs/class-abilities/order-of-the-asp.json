      "value": "<p>Cavaliers belonging to the order of the asp belong to a cutthroat group where ruthless pragmatism and underhanded dealing are the keys to moving up the chain of command. They tend to be brutal, self-centered leaders who reap confidence from their subordinatesâ€™ misery.<br><br><strong>Edicts: </strong>An order of the asp cavalier must endeavor to enhance her prestige, wealth, and power, as well as that of her patrons. She must endeavor to maximize her profits and efficiency, directing hirelings and even sacrificing them when doing so would further her goals and make her appear exceptional by comparison.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the asp cavalier issues a challenge, she receives a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls made against the target of the challenge so long as it is entangled, exhausted, fatigued, flanked, nauseated, prone, shaken, staggered, or denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the asp cavalier adds Knowledge (local) and Sleight of Hand to her list of class skills. The cavalier gains a bonus on Knowledge (local) checks equal to half her cavalier level (minimum +1) as long as the check involves her patrons or organization. She also reduces her armor check penalty when using Sleight of Hand by an amount equal to half her cavalier level (to a minimum of 0).</p>"
