    value: >-
      <p>You can communicate with a single type of animal (birds, cats, snakes,
      fish, and so on) as if you were constantly using
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ct9fhh8uawn8e4md]{Speak with Animals}. Although
      this ability grants you the ability to converse with such creatures, it
      grants you no special influence over them.</p>
