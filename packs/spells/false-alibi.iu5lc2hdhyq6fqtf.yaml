    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions similarly to <i>modify memory</i>, except you can
      modify the target's memory only in a specific way. In response to a
      triggering condition you determine, up to the last 5 minutes of the
      target's memory are eliminated and replaced with a memory of your choosing
      (or no memory at all). For example, you could cast this on an assassin,
      set it to trigger when he completes his kill, and replace his memory of
      the murder with the memory of him discovering the body and picking up the
      murder weapon. You can cast this spell multiple times on the same target,
      even with the same trigger, affecting different memories. A single casting
      of <i>false alibi</i> affects a creature only until the specified
      condition has been triggered; once a condition has been triggered and the
      target's memory altered, that condition no longer triggers this spell
      unless the victim is subject to another casting of <i>false alibi</i> that
      specifies the same trigger.</p>
