  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Harvested and concentrated from the remains of slain ghasts, this
      foul-smelling powder is kept in tightly sealed flasks. It is thrown as a
      splash weapon and the flask breaks on impact, releasing noxious dust. The
      target is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 3 rounds after that. A
      successful DC 12 Fortitude save prevents the nauseated condition, but not
      the sickened condition. Creatures within 5 feet of where the flask hits
      are sickened for 1 round. This is a poison
      effect.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (alchemy)</strong> DC
