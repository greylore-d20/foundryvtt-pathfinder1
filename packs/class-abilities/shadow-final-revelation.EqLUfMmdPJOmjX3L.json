You gain regeneration 5 while in dim light or darkness and immunity to cold, critical hits, and sneak attacks. Your regeneration is suppressed while in any level of illumination brighter than dim light. In addition, any spells you cast of the shadow subschool or with the darkness descriptor are automatically enlarged without affecting their spell level.</p>"
