  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A creature that takes a direct hit from a tanglefoot bomb must save
      against the bombâ€™s DC or be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had
      failed its save against a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.utncinnlwzscpzbd]{tanglefoot bag}.
      Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled but not
      glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at all.</p>
