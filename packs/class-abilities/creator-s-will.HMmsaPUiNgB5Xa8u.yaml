      <p>At 8th level, you can cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.jsvjsax2eabrlx8g]{Minor Creation} as a
      <em>spell-like ability</em>. You can have no more than one
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.jsvjsax2eabrlx8g]{Minor Creation}active at a time.
      If you cast the spell again, the previous casting immediately ends. At
      12th level, this ability improves to
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.b8lt1275mz4ez4d8]{Major Creation}. You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.</p>
