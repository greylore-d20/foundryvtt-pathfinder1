  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw
      or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1
      grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of
      the second roll, even if it is lower. The deedâ€™s cost cannot be reduced by
      the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect
      that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.</p>
