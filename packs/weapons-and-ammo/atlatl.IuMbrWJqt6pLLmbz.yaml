  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This Stone Age weapon is a thin piece of wood or antler used as a lever
      to hurl a specially fitted dart. An atlatl gives much greater range to a
      dart, but must be loaded like a projectile weapon. Your Strength modifier
      applies to damage rolls when you use an atlatl, just as it does for thrown
      weapons. You can fire-but not load-an atlatl with one hand. Loading an
      atlatl is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of
      opportunity. The Rapid Reload feat can be taken for atlatls, allowing you
      to load a dart as a free action.</p>
