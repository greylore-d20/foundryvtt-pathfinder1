    value: "<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers</strong>: Vine leshys are hardy and insightful, but sometimes forgetful. They gain a +2\_bonus to <em>Constitution</em> and <em>Wisdom</em> but suffer a –2\_penalty to <em>Intelligence</em>.</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Vine leshys are plants with the <em>leshy</em> subtype but lack the immunities to <em>mind-affecting</em> effects, <em>paralysis</em>, <em>poison</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>sleep</em>, and stunning that the <em>plant</em> type usually grants, and they lack the immunity to electricity and sonic that the <em>leshy</em> subtype usually grants.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Vine leshys are Small creatures and gain a +1\_<em>size bonus</em> to their AC, a +1\_<em>size bonus</em> on <em>attack rolls</em>, a –1\_penalty on <em>combat maneuver</em>\_checks and to their <em>Combat Maneuver Defense</em>, and a +4\_<em>size bonus</em> on <em>Stealth</em> checks.</li><li><strong>Base Speed</strong>: Vine leshys have a base speed of 20\_feet.</li><li><strong>Languages</strong>: Vine leshys begin play speaking Common and Sylvan. Vine leshys with high <em>Intelligence</em> scores can choose from the following: Aquan, Auran, Aklo, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, Terran, or Undercommon.</li></ul><h3>Feat and Skill Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Unassuming Foliage</strong>: Vine leshys gain a +4\_<em>racial bonus</em> on <em>Stealth</em> checks in forests.</li><li><strong>Climber</strong>: Vine leshys gain a +2\_<em>racial bonus</em> on <em>Climb</em> checks.</li></ul><h3>Magical Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Pass without Trace</strong>: Vine leshys have @Compendium[pf1.spells.2zyr6klf97jyr5ng]{pass without trace} as a constant <em>spell-like ability</em> (<em>caster level</em> 2nd).</li><li><strong>Plantspeech</strong>: Vine leshys can speak with vines as if subject to a continual @Compendium[pf1.spells.rrsefzpm3nhztvld]{speak with plants} spell.</li></ul><h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Darkvision</strong>: Vine leshys can see in the dark up to 60\_feet.</li><li><strong>Low-Light Vision</strong>: Vine leshys can see twice as far as humans under conditions of dim light.</li></ul><h3>Other Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Change Shape</strong>: Vine leshys can transform into vines, with results similar to @Compendium[pf1.spells.6ho3wsspkqkhypt0]{tree shape}. In this form, the leshy appears as a particularly healthy Small vine. The <em>leshy</em> can assume plant form or revert to its true form as a <em>swift action</em>.</li><li><strong>Verdant Burst</strong>: When slain, a vine leshy explodes in a burst of fertile energies. All <em>plant</em> creatures within 30\_feet of the slain leshy regain hit 1d8 points, and vines quickly infest the area. If the terrain can support vines, the undergrowth is dense enough to make the region into difficult terrain for 24\_hours, after which the plant life diminishes to a normal level; otherwise, this plant life has no significant effect on movement and withers and dies within an hour.</li></ul>"
