  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A penetrating charge is a bomb specifically designed to disable locks
      and similar mechanisms, though not other means of sealing a door, a
      container, or other sorts of devices. As a full-round action, the
      alchemist can place a penetrating charge on a lock. Instead of dealing
      damage, the penetrating charge seeps into the mechanism and eats away at
      it, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on any subsequent Disable Device
      checks against the mechanism. A creature can spend 10 minutes and attempt
      an appropriate Craft check (DC 15) to fix the lock and remove this
      bonus.</p>
