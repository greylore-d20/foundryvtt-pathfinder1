  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You hasten the onset of poison in the target. If the poison normally has
    an onset time, its effects begin immediately. If the poison has no onset
    time, its frequency is doubled, requiring two saving throws and inflicting
    damage twice per round or minute, though its duration is halved. Accelerate
    poison does not change the cure condition for the poison. If the target is
    affected by more than one poison, you may choose which is affected if you
    administered the poison; otherwise, randomly determine which poison is
    affected.</p>
