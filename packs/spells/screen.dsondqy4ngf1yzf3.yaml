      <p>This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and observation.
      When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in
      the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms.
      Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the
      area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed.
      Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct
      observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause
      to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the
      illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take
      care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.</p>
