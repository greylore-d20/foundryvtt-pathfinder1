  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The targeted suit of armor or shield sprouts thousands of tiny iron
      spikes like porcupine quills. These do not harm the armor's wearer (though
      donning or removing armor under the effects of this spell takes twice as
      long), but they act as armor spikes or shield spikes (as appropriate). Any
      creature attacking the wearer with natural weapons takes 1 point of
      piercing damage for each attack that hits. At 5th level, the spikes gain a
      +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls; this bonus increases to
      +2 at 10th level. At 15th level, the spikes also gain the <i>anarchic</i>
      weapon quality.</p>
