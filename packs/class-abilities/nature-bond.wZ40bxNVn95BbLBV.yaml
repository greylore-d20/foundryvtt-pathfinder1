      <p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one
      of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the
      druid one of the following cleric domains: <em>Air</em>, <em>Animal</em>,
      <em>Earth</em>, <em>Fire</em>, <em>Plant</em>, <em>Water</em>, or
      <em>Weather</em>. Druids also have access to a set of <em>Animal and
      Terrain Domains</em>. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted
      by this domain, the druid’s effective cleric level is equal to her druid
      level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain
      spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her
      domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell
      spontaneously.</p>

      <p>The second option is to form a close bond with an <em>animal
      companion</em>. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in
      <em>Animal Choices</em>. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies
      the druid on her adventures.</p>

      <p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion’s Hit Dice,
      abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a
      character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her
      effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the
      statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase
      in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the
      companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a
      new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of
      prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This
      ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
