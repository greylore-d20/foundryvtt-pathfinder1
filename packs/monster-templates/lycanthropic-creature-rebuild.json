This simple template reflects the creature’s hybrid form. The creature can’t take full animal form, and when it’s in its ordinary form, remove this template with the exceptions of change shape, low-light vision, and scent. Lycanthropic creatures don’t have to be humanoids, and at your discretion, a lycanthropic creature can afflict creatures of its own type with lycanthropy, in addition to humanoids.<p><b>Quick Rules:</b> +1 to AC; DR 5/silver; +1 on rolls based on Str, Dex, and Con; +1 hp/HD; bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus curse of lycanthropy*; change shape (normal or hybrid form; polymorph); lycanthropic empathy* (as appropriate for the lycanthrope).<p><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> Type gain the shapechanger subtype; DR 5/ silver; Senses low-light vision, scent; AC natural armor bonus increases by 1; Melee bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus curse of lycanthropy*; Special Attacks curse of lycanthropy*; Special Qualities change shape (normal or hybrid form; polymorph), lycanthropic empathy* (as appropriate for the lycanthrope); Ability Scores +2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con.</p>"
