  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting,
      called phrenic amplifications. The psychic can activate a phrenic
      amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the
      amplification modifies either the spell’s effects or the process of
      casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell.</p>

      <p>The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a
      spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can
      use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the
      amplification’s description states that it can be linked only to certain
      types of spells.</p>

      <p>A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from
      the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic
      learns a new phrenic amplification.</p>

      <p>A phrenic amplification can’t be selected more than once. Once a
      phrenic amplification has been selected, it can’t be changed.</p>

      <p>Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points
      from her phrenic pool to function.</p>
