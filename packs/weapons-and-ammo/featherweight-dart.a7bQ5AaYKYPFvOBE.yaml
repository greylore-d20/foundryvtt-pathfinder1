  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These extremely small and lightweight darts function like blowgun
      darts, except they are used to deliver poisons surreptitiously instead of
      dealing damage. When you hit with a dart, the poison is injected into the
      target while the dart breaks off and falls away, leaving the wound hard to
      spot. Any amount of damage reduction, hardness, or similar protection
      prevents the featherweight dart from delivering its injected poison.
      Anyone examining the target must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to
      find the puncture wound, while finding the dart itself at the location
      where it fell requires a successful DC 15 Perception check. This
      ammunition can be used in both blowguns and wrist launchers.</p>
