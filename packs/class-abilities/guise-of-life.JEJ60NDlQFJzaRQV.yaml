  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An undead vigilante with this talent gains an additional social
      identity in the form of one living creature identical to the vigilanteâ€™s
      appearance in life. Successful Knowledge checks reveal information about
      the vigilante as if he were a living creature, and he counts as living for
      the purpose of divination spells and effects. He gains no other benefit
      from appearing to be a living creature, and remains vulnerable to positive
      energy and spells that effect undead.</p>

      <p>The vigilante must be a corporeal undead creature to select this
      talent. Humanoid vigilantes with the negative energy affinity racial trait
      can also select this talent, gaining a human social identity.</p>
