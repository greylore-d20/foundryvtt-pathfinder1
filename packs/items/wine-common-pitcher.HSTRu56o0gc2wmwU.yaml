      <p>Wine is made from fermented fruit juice, usually grapes, but also
      sometimes berries, apples, or even rice (sake). This is unremarkable
      common wine. In colder climates, wine is often mulled with fruit, spices,
      honey, and almonds and served as a warming beverage during the winter.</p>
