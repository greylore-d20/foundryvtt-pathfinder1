  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, horrible, fungal growths sprout forth all
      over your body. You develop 1d2+1 of these blisters per 2 caster levels.
      Each time you are dealt more than 5 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or
      slashing damage from a single attack, one of these blisters bursts,
      releasing a cloud of harmful spores in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on
      you. These spores enter the lungs of all living creatures within the cloud
      that need to breathe and deal 1d6+1 points of damage for every 2 caster
      levels you have (Fortitude negates). This is a disease effect, and you and
      plants aren't affected by the spores. It is possible for more than one
      blister to burst in a single round. If you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit
      points, all remaining blisters burst, and the resulting spores deal the
      cumulative amount of damage.  You are not able to cast this spell while
      wearing heavy armor. If you don heavy armor during the spell's duration,
      all remaining blisters burst as if you had been reduced to 0 or fewer hit
      points.</p>
