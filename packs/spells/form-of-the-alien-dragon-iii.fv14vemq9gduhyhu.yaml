  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as per <i><i>Form of the Alien Dragon I</i>I</i>,
    except it also allows you to take the form of a Huge esoteric or outer
    dragon. Psychics can choose from the esoteric dragon (astral, dream,
    etheric, nightmare, or occult) forms only. You gain the following: a +10
    size bonus to your Strength, a +8 size bonus to your Constitution, a +8
    natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 120 feet (poor), blindsense with a range
    of 60 feet, darkvision with a range of 120 feet, a breath weapon, damage
    reduction 10/magic, frightful presence (DC = DC for this spell), and
    immunity to one form of energy or effect (of the same type <i>Form of the
    Alien Dragon I</i> grants either a bonus against or resistance to, if any).
    You also gain one bite attack (2d8), two claw attacks (2d6), two wing
    attacks (1d8), and one tail slap attack (2d6). You can use the breath weapon
    as often as you like, but must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath
    weapons deal 12d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex
    save to halve the normal damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot
    lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones.</p>
