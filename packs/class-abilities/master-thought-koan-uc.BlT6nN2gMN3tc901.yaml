  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monk with this ability can spend an additional 2 ki points when using
      either the breaking-down koan or building-up koan ki powers. When combined
      with master-thought koan, breaking-down koan affects a number of
      characters of your choice within 30 feet equal to the monkâ€™s wisdom
      modifier. When combined with master-thought koan, building-up koan can be
      used on an ally within 30 feet.</p>

      <p>A monk must be at least 12th level and have either the breaking-down
      koan or the building-up koan ki power before selecting this ki power.</p>
