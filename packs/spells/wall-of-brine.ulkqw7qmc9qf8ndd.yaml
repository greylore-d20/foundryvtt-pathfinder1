  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a 5-foot-thick wall of seawater with a powerful current
      flowing toward one side of the wall, selected by you; a creature
      attempting to swim against this current must spend 4 squares of movement
      to enter a square of the wall. A creature that begins its turn in the wall
      is ejected in the direction of the current just before it acts. The wall
      provides cover against attacks from out of the water, as usual for a body
      of water. The water and the currents deflect physical ranged attacks into
      or through the wall, unless a weapon used is exceptionally massive (such
      as a siege engine). A creature submerged in the wall takes the usual
      penalties for underwater combat. The wall blocks gases and liquids and
      prevents water from mixing at its edges.</p>
