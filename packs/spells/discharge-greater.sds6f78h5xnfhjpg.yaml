      <p>This spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.cnn3hvm9e4bub6pr]{discharge}, except it can
      discharge multiple technological objects and can be used to target an
      area.</p><p>You choose to use greater <em>discharge</em> in one of two
      ways: an area <em>discharge</em> or a targeted
      <em>discharge</em>.</p><p><strong>Area Discharge</strong>: When greater
      <em>discharge</em> is used in this way, the spell affects everything
      within a 20-foot-radius burst.</p><p>Each creature in the area is affected
      as though by <em>discharge</em> (affecting only one object in the
      creature's possession), and each unattended object is similarly
      affected.</p><p><strong>Targeted Discharge</strong>: This spell functions
      as <em>discharge</em>, but if the target is a creature, it can
      <em>discharge</em> one randomly determined object from the target's
      charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you
      possess.</p>
