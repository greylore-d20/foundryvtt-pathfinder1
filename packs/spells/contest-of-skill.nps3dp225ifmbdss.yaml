    value: >-
      <p>The randomness of critical hits has long vexed certain duelists in the
      Aldori school who consider luck to be an unwelcome addition to duels,
      which they view as contests of skill rather than chance. The creature
      targeted by this spell is infused with magical power, altering the odds of
      combat to weaken lucky strikes. Critical threats made by the affected
      creature automatically fail to confirm. Critical threats that
      automatically confirm due to class features or feats, such as the
      fighter's weapon mastery, are unaffected by this spell. In addition, when
      the initial target of this spell fails its Will save to resist <i>Contest
      of Skill</i>, it can select one additional creature within range of the
      spell to suffer the effects of the spell as well (Will negates). If this
      secondary target negates this spell with a successful save, the duration
      of <i>Contest of Skill</i> on the primary target is reduced to 1
      round.</p>
