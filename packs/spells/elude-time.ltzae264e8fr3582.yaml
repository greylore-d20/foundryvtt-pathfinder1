  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You place yourself in a state of suspended animation, similar to
      <i>temporal stasis</i>. At the time of casting, you choose when the stasis
      will expire, up to the maximum duration of the spell.</p><p>Until the
      duration ends, time ceases to flow for you, and all bodily functions
      cease. No force or effect can harm you until the spell expires or is
      removed, such as by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> spell.</p>
