  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The bloodrager’s source of internal power grants him the ability to
      bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds
      per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st,
      he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to
      Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.usdv1eqvibmxun6x]{Bear's Endurance}) don’t increase
      the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The
      total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8
      hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.<p>A bloodrager can
      enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager
      gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2
      morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a –2 penalty to Armor
      Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per
      Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost
      first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot
      use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except
      Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires
      patience or concentration.<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free
      action. When the bloodrage ends, he’s fatigued for a number of rounds
      equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager
      cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can
      otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or
      combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends,
      placing him in peril of death.<p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian’s rage
      class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic
      item abilities, and spell effects.</p>
