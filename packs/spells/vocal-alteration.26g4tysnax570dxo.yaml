    value: >-
      <p>You alter the target's voice to something else. For example, you could
      make the target's voice high-pitched, husky, or nasal, or change its
      accent to an accent you are familiar with.</p><p>If this spell is used as
      part of a disguise, the target gets a +10 bonus on the Disguise check when
      trying to fool a listener.</p><p>The target can vary the disguised voice
      just as it could its normal voice. For example, a halfling female given a
      male dwarf noble's voice and accent could speak in falsetto, with a rural
      halfling accent, and so on.</p>
