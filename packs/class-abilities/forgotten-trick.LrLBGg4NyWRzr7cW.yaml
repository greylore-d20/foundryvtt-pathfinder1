  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this ability can recall one trick taught to her by her
      ancient masters. When she uses this ability, she selects one ninja trick
      (not a master trick or rogue talent) that she does not know and can use
      that ninja trick for a number of rounds equal to her level.</p>

      <p>She must pay any ki costs associated with the trick as normal. Using
      this ability expends 2 ki point from her ki pool, plus the ki cost of the
      trick she chooses.</p>
