  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day when the investigator has confirmed a critical hit with a
      studied strike, he can deal average damage instead of rolling damage as
      normal. This includes the damage dealt by the successful attack as well as
      the additional damage from the studied strike.</p>

      <p>He can expend a use of inspiration to use this ability a second time
      per day.</p>

      <p>Using this ability doesnâ€™t require an action.</p>

      <p>The investigator must be at least 5th level to select this talent.</p>
