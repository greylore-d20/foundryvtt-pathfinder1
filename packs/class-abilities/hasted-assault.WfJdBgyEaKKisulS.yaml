  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to
      move more quickly. This functions as haste, but only targets the magus and
      lasts for a number of rounds equal to the magus's Intelligence bonus.</p>

      <p>The magus must be at least 9th level before selecting this magus
      arcana.</p>
