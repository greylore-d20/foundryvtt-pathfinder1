      <b>Burn</b> 1</p>

      <p>You can purge yourself or another with flame, removing all impurities.
      This functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.myg2b9ww43nnlbr2]{Break
      Enchantment} on a single target. The target must be willing and takes 2
      points of fire damage per character level as well as 1 point of burn (you
      do not need to accept burn unless you are the target). You can use this
      ability even when affected by an effect that denies you actions, so long
      as this effect is one that break enchantment could remove.</p>

      <p>If you burn rare incense or igneous rocks from Mount Kumijinja worth
      100 gp or 1,000 gp as part of using purging flame, your target also
      benefits from restoration, as if the spell were cast using diamonds of
      equal value as a material component.</p>
