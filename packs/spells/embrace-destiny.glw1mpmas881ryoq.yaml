  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon completing this spell, roll a single d20 and record the result. At
      any point during the duration of this spell, you may use that roll for a
      single ability check, attack roll, initiative check, saving throw, or
      skill check, using the recorded result in place of a roll. This spell
      cannot be used to replace a roll that has already been made; the recorded
      result must be used instead of a roll. Once you have used this recorded
      result or the duration of the spell ends, the spell's effect ends. You
      can't have more than one instance of <i>embrace destiny</i> active on you
      at the same time.</p>
