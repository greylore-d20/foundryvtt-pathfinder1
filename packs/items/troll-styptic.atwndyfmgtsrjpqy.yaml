    value: >-
      <p>A witch's brew of <em>troll</em> blood, powdered <em>plant</em>
      extracts, and alchemical binders, troll styptic is intended as a field
      treatment for wounds and bleeding, particularly where magical
      <em>healing</em> is not available. This powder is stored in small packets,
      and when applied directly to wounds grants a living creature <em>fast
      healing</em> 2 for 2d4 rounds, as well as closing any open wounds the
      subject has or receives while the styptic is active, preventing ongoing
      damage from bleeding. This is a painful cure and requires the target to
      make a DC 15 <em>Fortitude</em> save to avoid being <em>sickened</em> for
      the duration of the <em>fast healing</em>.</p>
