    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions exactly as the spell <i>nightmare</i>. In addition to the effects of that spell, you can cause a second spell to be delivered when the target wakes at the <i>nightmare</i>'s conclusion.</p><p>You must have this second spell prepared, and it must be cast immediately after <i>vision of Lamashtu</i> (effectively adding the two spells' casting times). This second spell \"rides along\" with the <i>nightmare</i>, affecting the target as soon as it wakes from its fitful sleep. Any spell can be sent along with the <i>nightmare</i>, so long as it is of 6th level or lower, affects one target (which is always the <i>nightmare</i>'s recipient), and does not deal hit point damage. The second spell's range is irrelevant for the purposes of <i>vision of Lamashtu</i>, and even touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must still make a successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with the act of touching occurring within the context of the victim's <i>nightmare</i>). The target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed. For example, a cleric of Lamashtu could send <i>bestow curse</i> along as part of a <i>vision of Lamashtu</i>, but not <i>blade barrier</i> (affects an area), <i>destruction</i> (too high level), or <i>inflict moderate wounds</i> (deals hit point damage).</p>",
