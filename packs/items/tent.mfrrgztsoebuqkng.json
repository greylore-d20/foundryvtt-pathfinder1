Two Small creatures count as a Medium creature, and one Large creature counts as two Medium creatures. Packing up a tent takes half as long as assembling it.</p>\n<p><b>Small/Normal</b>: A small tent holds one Medium creature and takes 20 minutes to assemble.</p>\n<p><b>Medium</b>: A medium tent holds two creatures and takes 30 minutes to assemble.</p>\n<p><b>Large</b>: A large tent holds four creatures and takes 45 minutes to assemble.</p>\n<p><b>Pavilion</b>: A huge open-air canopy, plus stakes, poles, and ropes. A pavilion holds 10 creatures and takes 90 minutes to assemble. Pavilion tents are large enough to accommodate a small fire in the center.</p>\n<p><b>Hanging Tent</b> A hanging tent is a small tent (able to comfortably house a single Medium creature) with a teardrop shape, which hangs from a sturdy anchor rope. The rope can be tied to a tree limb, grappling hook, or even a piton hammered into a cliff side. Hanging tents are used primarily in mountainous terrain (where no flat surface may be available for camping) and swamps (where no dry ground may be available). Climbing in or out of a hanging tent is a <em>full-round action</em> that requires a DC 10 <em>Climb</em> check. Failure indicates another attempt must be made, while failure by 5 or more indicates the camper has fallen from the tent. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>"
