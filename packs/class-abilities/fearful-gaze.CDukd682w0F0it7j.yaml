    value: >-
      <p>With a single shout, the shaman causes one target creature within 30
      feet to become shaken for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw negates
      this effect.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, she makes the target frightened instead.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, she makes it panicked instead. This is a mind-affecting
      fear effect.</p>

      <p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24
      hours.</p>
