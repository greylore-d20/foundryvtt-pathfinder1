      "value": "<p>Not all knights begin their careers as nobles’ children or as squires. Some start out as thieves, murderers, or cheats, and only after they see the suffering caused by their crimes do they dedicate themselves to honorable service. Cavaliers who follow this order seek to make up for the crimes they’ve committed in the past, and do whatever they can to restore their tainted honor.<br><br><strong>Edicts:</strong> The cavalier must be merciful to wrongdoers and show unfettered fairness whenever he passes judgment. He must assume that only the most heinous monsters are irrevocably evil, and must deliver all foes capable of fair trial to the appropriate local law enforcers.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the penitent cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus to his CMD against combat maneuvers made by the target of his challenge whenever he is threatening the target. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the penitent cavalier adds Escape Artist (Dex) and Sense Motive (Wis) to his list of class skills. Whenever he makes an Escape Artist check, the cavalier may add his Strength bonus to the check in addition to his Dexterity modifier.</p>"
