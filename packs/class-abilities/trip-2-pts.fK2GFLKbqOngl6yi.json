Whenever the eidolon makes a successful bite attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If successful, the target is knocked prone. If the check fails, the eidolon is not tripped in return. This ability only works on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the eidolon.</p>\n<p>The eidolon must possess the bite evolution to select this evolution.</p>"
