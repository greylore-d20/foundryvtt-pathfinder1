      <p>You subtly enhance or diminish the effects of natural winds within the
      spell's area, which is an immobile emanation around a point touched by you
      as the spell is cast. Within the area, natural (but not magical) wind
      effects are either increased or decreased by one step in intensity (Core
      Rulebook 439). The maximum wind force you can affect with this spell is
      based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. Alter winds has
      no effect on magical wind effects.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Caster
