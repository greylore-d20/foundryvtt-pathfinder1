      <p><b>Element</b> earth, wood; <b>Type</b> form infusion; <b>Level</b> 6;
      <b>Burn</b> 4<br><b>Prerequisite</b> extended range<br><b>Associated
      Blasts</b> earth, magma, metal, mud<br><b>Saving Throw</b> none</p>

      <p>You infuse the ground in a 20-foot radius anywhere within 120 feet of
      you on an earthen surface (if you are using a metal blast, this infusion
      affects a metal surface instead). The ground roils and buckles beneath the
      affected area. All creatures and objects in contact with the ground within
      the area when you create it automatically take 1/4 of the normal damage
      from your blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the area,
      it takes half the normal damage from your blast, as do creatures that end
      their turns in the area. The entire area counts as difficult terrain.</p>

      <p>This infusion lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution
      modifier or until you use it again.</p>
