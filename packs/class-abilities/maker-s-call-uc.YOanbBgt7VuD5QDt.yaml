  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to
      his side. This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{dimension door}, using the
      summonerâ€™s caster level. When this ability is used, the eidolon appears
      adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces
      are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The
      summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one
      additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.</p>
