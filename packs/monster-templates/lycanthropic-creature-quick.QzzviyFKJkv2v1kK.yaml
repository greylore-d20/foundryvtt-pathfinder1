      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      Yes<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Lycanthropic creatures can act as
      simpler variants of any sort of lycanthrope in hybrid form, but the
      default is for a werewolf-like creature, so if the base lycanthrope has
      different features, adjust the creature accordingly (for instance, a
      wereshark can swim). This simple template reflects the creature’s hybrid
      form. The creature can’t take full animal form, and when it’s in its
      ordinary form, remove this template with the exceptions of change shape,
      low-light vision, and scent. Lycanthropic creatures don’t have to be
      humanoids, and at your discretion, a lycanthropic creature can afflict
      creatures of its own type with lycanthropy, in addition to
      humanoids.<p><b>Quick Rules:</b> +1 to AC; DR 5/silver; +1 on rolls based
