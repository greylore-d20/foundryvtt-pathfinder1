      <p>As a standard action, you can unleash a flash of electricity. This
      flash deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two
      wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and
      dazzles them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save negates the dazzled
      effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2
      your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a
      number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
