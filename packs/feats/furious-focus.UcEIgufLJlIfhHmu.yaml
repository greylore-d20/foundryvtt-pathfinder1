    value: >-
      <p><em>Even in the midst of fierce and furious blows, you can find focus
      in the carnage and your seemingly wild blows strike
      home.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Str 13,
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.FUW5mIXHNBBIQ1Sq]{Power Attack}, base
      attack bonus +1.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you are wielding a
      two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon with two hands, and using the
      Power Attack feat, you do not suffer Power Attackâ€™s penalty on melee
      attack rolls on the first attack you make each turn. You still suffer the
      penalty on any additional attacks, including attacks of
      opportunity.</p><h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>When using the Power Attack feat
      and wielding a two-handed melee weapon or a onehanded melee weapon with
      two hands, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, each successful
      attack you make against a target reduces your Power Attack penalty against
      that target by 1 (to a minimum of 0) until the beginning of your next
      turn.</p>
