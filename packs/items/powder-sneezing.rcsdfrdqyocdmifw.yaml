      <p>This coarse yellowish-red powder is a <em>splash weapon</em> that
      causes uncontrollable sneezing for 1d4+1 rounds. Anyone standing in the
      square of impact must succeed on a DC 12 <em>Fortitude</em> save to resist
      the powder, while those in adjacent squares must make DC 8
      <em>Fortitude</em> saves. Creatures affected by sneezing powder must make
      a DC 10 <em>Fortitude</em> save every round for the duration or be
      <em>staggered</em> until their next turn.</p>

      <p><b>Create</b>: <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC 25</p>
