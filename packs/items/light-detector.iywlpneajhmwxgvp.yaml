      <p>This hand-sized metal plate is covered with a thin layer of
      light-sensitive transparent paste. If exposed to light, the paste darkens
      and becomes opaque, depending on the amount of light. Bright light causes
      it to fully darken in 1 round, normal light in 3 rounds, and dim light in
      10 rounds. It is mainly used by creatures with <em>darkvision</em> to
      determine whether creatures carrying light have recently passed through an
      area. The plate is sold wrapped in a thick black cloth to prevent
      accidental light exposure from ruining the plate.</p>
