      <p>As a standard action, you can issue a command to one living creature by
      expending 1 point of mental focus. This functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.2p6fzj5t03oivndd]{Command}. The target must be
      within 30 feet and capable of understanding your order. The target can
      attempt a Will save to negate this effect. If the creature is the same
      creature type as you, it takes a â€“2 penalty on this saving throw.</p>
