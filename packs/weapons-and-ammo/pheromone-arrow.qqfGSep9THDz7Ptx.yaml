      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>The arrowhead of this arrow is coated with potent substances that react
      to blood and sweat, releasing a strong aroma that most predators recognize
      as the scent of tasty injured prey and other creatures perceive as merely
      unpleasant.</p>

      <p>Any creature with the scent ability gains a <b>+2 circumstance bonus on
      attack and damage rolls</b> against a target marked with a pheromone
      arrow.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts for 1 hour or until the target spends 1 minute
      washing it off.</p>
