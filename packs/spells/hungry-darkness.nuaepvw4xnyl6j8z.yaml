  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates an area of intense blackness, as <i>deeper
      darkness</i>, but filled with unseen chewing teeth and ravenous maws. Any
      creatures beginning its turn within the <i>hungry darkness</i> is gnawed
      and slashed by these unseen fangs of force, dealing 3d6 points of force
      damage and 2 points of Constitution damage per round. Once a creature
      leaves the cloud, it continues to take 1d6 points of bleed damage each
      round until it receives magical healing or enters an area of bright light.
      Spell resistance can prevent damage from the <i>hungry darkness</i> but
      not against the darkness it creates.</p>
