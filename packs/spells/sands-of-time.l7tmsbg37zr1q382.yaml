  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You temporarily age the target, immediately advancing it to the next age
    category. The target immediately takes the age penalties to Strength,
    Dexterity, and Constitution for its new age category, but does not gain the
    bonuses for that category.</p><p>A creature whose age is unknown is treated
    as if the spell advances it to middle age. Ageless or immortal creatures are
    immune to this spell.</p><p>If you cast this on an object, construct, or
    undead creature, it takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
    (maximum +15) as time weathers and corrodes it. This version of the spell
    has an instantaneous duration.</p>
