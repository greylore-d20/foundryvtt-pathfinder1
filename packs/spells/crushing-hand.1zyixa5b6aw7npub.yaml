  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.wu4y1ilg6iq28cr6]{interposing hand},
      except that it can also grapple one opponent as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.h2r6m68142borl8k]{grasping hand}. Its CMB
      and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base
      attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus
      for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A
      <em>crushing hand</em> deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful
      grapple check against an opponent. The <em>crushing hand</em> can instead
      be directed to bull rush a target (as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.aoov6nqfm195txdb]{forceful hand}), using
      the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose
      itself, as <em>interposing hand</em> does.</p>
