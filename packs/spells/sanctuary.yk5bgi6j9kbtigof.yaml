    value: >-
      <p>Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even
      with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the
      opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the
      spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the
      attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the
      warded creature for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Those not attempting
      to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the
      warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells.
      The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack
      spells or otherwise act.</p>
