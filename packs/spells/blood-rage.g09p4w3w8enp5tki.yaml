      <p>The targets of this spell become angrier as they fight, the pain of
      their wounds fueling their strength. An affected creature gains a
      cumulative +2 morale bonus to Strength and a cumulative -1 penalty to AC
      for every 5 points of damage it takes (maximum +10 Strength, -5 AC) for
      the duration of the spell. These bonuses last until the spell expires or
      the target falls unconscious.</p>
