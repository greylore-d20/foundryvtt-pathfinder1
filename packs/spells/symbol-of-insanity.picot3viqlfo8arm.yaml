      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except that all creatures within the radius of the <em>symbol of
      insanity</em> instead become permanently insane (as the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.s6q72tw2zra9sycu]{insanity}
      spell).</p><p>Unlike <em>symbol of death</em>, <em>symbol of insanity</em>
      has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <em>symbol of insanity</em>
      simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster
      level.</p><p><em>Note:</em> Magic traps such as <em>symbol of
      insanity</em> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the
      Perception skill to find a <em>symbol of insanity</em> and Disable Device
      to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for
      <em>symbol of insanity</em>.</p>
