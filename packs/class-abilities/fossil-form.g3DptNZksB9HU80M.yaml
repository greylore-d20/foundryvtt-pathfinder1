  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At the beginning of your turn as a swift action, you can infuse your
      flesh with minerals, granting you cumbersome security. Until the beginning
      of your next turn, you are staggered, gain hardness 2, and gain a +2 bonus
      on saving throws against petrification. This hardness increases by 2 and
      your saving throw bonus increases by 1 for every 4 cleric levels you have.
      You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Acid Dart power of the Earth Domain.</p>
