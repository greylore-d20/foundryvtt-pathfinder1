      <p>At 10th level, you can surround yourself with a tangible aura of
      majesty for 1 minute. While this aura is active, once per round as a swift
      action you can issue a command (as the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.2p6fzj5t03oivndd]{Command} spell) to one creature
      within 30 feet; the creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or submit
      for 1 round.</p>
