      "value": "<p><em>The aspect of the frog grants great mobility in leaping through the air and swimming in water, as well surprising tactics in combat.</em><br><br><strong>Minor Form:</strong> You gain a +4 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping and on Swim checks.</p>\n<p>These bonuses increase to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<br><br><strong>Major Form:</strong> Your shape changes to that of a Large frog (as per the giant frog but with a space of 10 feet;&nbsp;Bestiary&nbsp;135). While in this form, you gain a base speed of 30 feet, a swim speed of 30 feet, lowlight vision, scent (30 feet), a bite attack (1d6 damage) with the grab ability, and the ability to treat all jumps as if you had a running start.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain a tongue attack (see below).</p>\n<p>At 15th level, your swim speed increases to 60 feet. In addition, the reach of your tongue attack increases to 30 feet, and your tongue attack deals bludgeoning damage equal to the damage dealt by your shifter claws.<br><br><em>Tongue (Ex):</em> Your tongue is a primary natural attack with a reach of 15 feet. Your tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to grab. You do not gain the grappled condition while using your tongue in this manner.<br><br><strong>Alternate Natural Attacks:</strong> Bite (B, P, S)</p>"
