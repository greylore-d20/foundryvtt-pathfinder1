      - Mesmerist
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were
      fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick
      when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she
      threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any
      unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as
      threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but canâ€™t
      actually make attacks.</p>

      <p>The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick
      is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that
      interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve
      the effect.</p>
