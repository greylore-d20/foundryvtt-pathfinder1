    value: >-
      <p>A rare spell without verbal components, <i>lipstitch</i> sews the
      target's lips tightly together if it fails a saving throw, such that no
      clear speech, bite attacks, spellcasting, or use of command words is
      possible. The target takes 1d6 points of damage as the stitches weave
      through flesh. The victim can still make enough noise to be heard at a
      distance with a DC 10 Perception check.</p><p>The thread created by
      <i>lipstitch</i> can be burst with a DC 20 Strength check as a standard
      action or can be sliced open with a piercing or slashing weapon (wielded
      by the target or an ally) as a full-round action. Cutting the thread
      provokes attacks of opportunity, while making a Strength check does not.
      Either option causes 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of bleed damage. The
      target has a 20% chance of failing to cast spells with verbal components
      until the bleeding is stopped. The effects of multiple castings of this
      spell do not stack. Optionally, the thread can be removed more carefully
      over the course of a minute with a DC 20 Heal check. If the check fails,
      the target takes damage and bleeds as described above. If the check
      succeeds, the stitches are removed with no harm. Creatures with no mouths
      are unaffected by <i>lipstitch</i>. Creatures with multiple mouths lose
      the use of only one mouth per casting-the particular mouth is chosen by
      the caster.</p>
