  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a melee weapon sized appropriately for you from opaque
      force. You are considered proficient with this weapon, which acts in all
      ways as a masterwork weapon typical of its type. The <i>instant weapon</i>
      has hardness 20 and the same number of hit points as a typical weapon of
      its type. As a force effect, it can strike and damage incorporeal
      creatures. If the <i>instant weapon</i> leaves your hand at any time, the
      spell ends at the beginning of your next turn.</p>
