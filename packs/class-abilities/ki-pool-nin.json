      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of&nbsp;ki&nbsp;points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).<br><br>By spending 1 point from her&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.<br><br>The&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of&nbsp;ki&nbsp;points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use&nbsp;ki&nbsp;points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool.</p>"
