      <p>Your animal companion works in perfect harmony with your mastery of
      nature. You share one of the following class abilities with your companion
      for every 4 caster levels you possess: camouflage, favored enemy, favored
      terrain, hide in plain sight, resist nature's lure, swift tracker,
      trackless step, venom immunity, and woodland stride. You must have the
      ability in question to share it with your companion, and it functions for
      your companion just as it functions for you, save that each favored enemy
      or favored terrain you share counts as a separate class ability for the
      purpose of this spell.  At the GM's discretion, you may instead share an
      ability granted by an archetype that substitutes for one of the above
      abilities, such as the arctic endurance, arctic native, icewalking, and
      snowcaster abilities of an arctic druidAPG.</p>
