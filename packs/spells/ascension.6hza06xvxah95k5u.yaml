    value: >-
      <p>You imbue a number of creatures with mythic power, granting each of
      them 1st tier in a mythic path of its choice. The creatures immediately
      gain the benefits of their chosen paths. Divide the duration evenly among
      all targets.  The targets retain their mythic tier only while they're
      within 100 feet of the spell's focus component. A target that goes outside
      this range loses its mythic tier, but instantly regains it if it moves
      into range again. If the focus component is destroyed while the spell is
      in effect, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent
      negative levels.</p>
