  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the shaman sheds her body and becomes
      incorporeal. While in this form, all of her weapon attacks are considered
      to have the ghost touch weapon special ability.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability for a number of rounds equal to her
      shaman level, though those rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
