      <p>A hurlbat is a throwing axe made from a single piece of flat metal.
      Every extremity of the hurlbat is sharpened, including the point of the
      handle. You can wield the hurlbat as a melee weapon, but it's not designed
      for such use; you take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls with the weapon,
      and you must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save when making melee attacks to
      avoid cutting yourself on an edge and taking 1 point of slashing damage.
      You don't need to attempt this save while wearing heavy armor.</p>
