  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You maintain an unshakable sense of who you are, and no force can
      compel you to be anything else. You gain a +1 sacred (if your patron is
      good or neutral) or profane (if your patron is evil) bonus on saving
      throws against polymorph, petrification, and transmutation effects. This
      bonus increases by 1 for every 5 cleric levels you have (maximum +5). Once
      per day when you succeed at a saving throw against such an effect, you can
      gain a surge of self-confidence as an immediate action that grants you a
      number of temporary hit points equal to your cleric level and a +2 morale
      bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws; both effects last
      for 1 minute.</p><p>This power replaces the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.2mnWAoFKqKKxWCt4]{Liberation}
      power of the
