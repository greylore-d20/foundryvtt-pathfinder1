    value: >-
      <p>You transform one melee weapon into a burning glaive similar to the
      ones wielded by the runelords of old. The target of your spell must be a
      masterwork or magical melee weapon appropriate to your size. The weapon
      becomes a glaive appropriate to your size and has a +1 enhancement bonus
      and the <i>flaming</i> weapon special ability. When wielding the glaive,
      you are considered proficient with it and use your caster level as your
      base attack bonus (which may give you multiple attacks). When you reach
      caster level 14th, the glaive gains the <i>spell-storing</i> weapon
      special ability. When you reach caster level 17th, it loses the
      <i>flaming</i> weapon special ability, and gains the <i>flaming</i> burst
      weapon special ability. The glaive's enhancement bonus increases to +2 at
      caster level 15th, and +3 at caster level 19th.  If this spell is cast on
      a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon
      normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the
      weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not
      cumulative with <i>greater magic weapon</i> or any other spell that might
      modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A
      masterwork weapon's bonus on attack rolls does not stack with an
      enhancement bonus to attack.</p>
