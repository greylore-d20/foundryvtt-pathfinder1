      <p>You transform the target into a harmless animal of the same approximate
      body type. The form assumed must be one considered unobtrusive by local
      communities, such as a cat, a dog, a hunting hawk, a horse, or a rat. This
      transformation can reduce the target by up to two size categories, but
      cannot make an animal smaller than Tiny. It cannot increase the size of
      the target or give it new natural attacks or new forms of movement. The
      spell otherwise functions as <i>beast shape II</i>.</p>
