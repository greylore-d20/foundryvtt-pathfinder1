      <p>You speak a short message (up to 10 words per caster level), implanting
      both it and the identity of the message's intended recipient in the mind
      of a willing creature. The creature is aware of the message and who the
      recipient is.</p><p>Any attempt to speak, write, or otherwise communicate
      the message to anyone other than its intended recipient causes the target
      to forget the message for 1d6 minutes. Attempts to read the target's mind
      (such as with <i>detect</i> thoughts) or to force the target to reveal the
      message (such as with torture or magical compulsion) likewise cause
      temporary amnesia regarding the message.</p><p>The target can communicate
      the message only to someone it believes is the intended recipient, which
      means that disguises, illusions, and polymorph effects might fool the
      target into delivering the message. Once the target communicates the
      message, the message is permanently erased from the target's memory.</p>
