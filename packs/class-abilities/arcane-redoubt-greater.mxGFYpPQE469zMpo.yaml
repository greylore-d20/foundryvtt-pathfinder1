  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the magus uses his arcane redoubt magus arcana, he may spend
      an additional point from his arcane pool in order to apply his shield
      bonus to AC (including any enhancement bonus) as a bonus on Reflex saves
      until the beginning of his next turn. If he is targeted with an effect
      requiring a Reflex save while using this power, he may spend 2 points from
      his arcane pool as an immediate action to grant himself evasion, or 4
      points to grant himself improved evasion.</p>

      <p>The magus must have the arcane redoubt magus arcana and be at least
      12th level to select this magus arcana.</p>
