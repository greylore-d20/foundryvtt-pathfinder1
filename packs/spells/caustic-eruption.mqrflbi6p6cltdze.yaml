      <p>Acid erupts from your space in all directions, causing 1d6 points of
      damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to creatures and unattended objects
      in the area. On your turn in each of the next 2 rounds, creatures and
      objects that failed their saves against the initial burst take an
      additional 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6)
      unless the acid is neutralized, dispelled, or washed away.</p>
