    value: >-
      <p>The tip of this heavy javelin is designed to break off and embed itself
      into a shield once it hits. Like ammunition, a thrown pilum that hits its
      target is destroyed. If you hit a shieldbearing opponent with a pilum, he
      loses the AC bonuses from that shield until he takes a standard action to
      pry the remnants of the pilum from his shield.</p>
