      "value": "<p>You maintain an unshakable sense of who you are, and no force can compel you to be anything else. You gain a +1 sacred (if your patron is good or neutral) or profane (if your patron is evil) bonus on saving throws against polymorph, petrification, and transmutation effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 cleric levels you have (maximum +5). Once per day when you succeed at a saving throw against such an effect, you can gain a surge of self-confidence as an immediate action that grants you a number of temporary hit points equal to your cleric level and a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws; both effects last for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Liberation power of the Liberation Domain or the Strength Surge power of the Strength Domain.</p>"
