      <p>You shroud an area in Urgathoa's unclean influence, rendering those who
      pass through it and fail their Will saving throws more enticing to
      ravenous undead. When an affected creature comes within 60 feet of an
      undead creature, the spell immediately draws the undead creature's
      attention, granting it a +4 bonus  on Perception checks to notice the
      affected creature and on saving throws to resist spells that hide or
      disguise the affected creature (such as <i>hide from</i> undead). Once the
      undead creature notices the affected creature, it feels compelled to kill
      and devour the affected creature, and gains a +1 profane bonus on attack
      rolls made against the affected creature and a +1 profane bonus on saving
      throws against the affected creature's spells and special abilities. The
      undead also ignores any concealment less than total concealment that an
      affected creature has. Each time the spell draws an undead creature's
      attention to an affected creature, the spell's haunt-like manifestation
      occurs during that round.</p>
