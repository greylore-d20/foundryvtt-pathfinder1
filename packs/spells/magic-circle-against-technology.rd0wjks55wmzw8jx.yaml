  description:
    value: >-
      <p>All creatures within the area gain the effects of a <i>Protection from
      Technology</i> spell. Creatures in the area, or that later enter the area,
      receive only one attempt to suppress technological effects that are
      controlling them. If a creature succeed at this save, such effects are
      suppressed as long as the creature remains in the area. Creatures that
      leave the area and then return are not protected. Robots receive a saving
      throw and spell resistance to avoid being kept at bay, but the deflection
      and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply to
      non-technological creatures in the area even if a robot succeeds at its
      saving throw and is thus able to enter the area.</p><p>This spell is not
      cumulative with <i>Protection from Technology</i> and vice versa.</p>
