      "value": "<p><em>You can make additional attacks of opportunity.</em><br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />You may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to your Dexterity bonus. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.<br /><br /><strong>Normal</strong><br />A character without this feat can make only one attack of opportunity per round and can't make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong><br />The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability more than once per round.<br /><br /><strong>Combat Trick</strong><br />When you miss with an attack of opportunity, you can spend 5 stamina points to make a second attack for the same provoking action. That second attack of opportunity takes a -5 penalty on the attack roll and costs one of your attacks of opportunity for the round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Usage</strong>: spend 1 charge after use.</p>"
