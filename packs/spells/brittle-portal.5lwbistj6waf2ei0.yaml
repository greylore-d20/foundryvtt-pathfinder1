      <p>This spell weakens the bonds of existence, and reduces the hardness of
      any nonmagical surface within its area of effect by 2 per caster level.
      The spell is centered on a flat surface chosen by the caster, and the
      hardness reduction effect persists for the duration of the spell.</p>
