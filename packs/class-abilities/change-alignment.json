      "value": "<p>Once per day as part of his preparation of infusions, the alchemist can brew an infusion that shifts the imbiberâ€™s alignment to good. This change in alignment lasts for 10 minutes per alchemist level. An unwilling creature receives a Will save to resist this change. The alchemist may have only one such infusion at any one time. The effects of this infusion may have serious repercussions for a creature suddenly struggling with a new outlook. Many see it as little more than forced insanity, and some good faiths outlaw its use.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 12th level and have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>"
