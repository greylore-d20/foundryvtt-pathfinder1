  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure an anchor of pure force that immediately skewers your
      target on a successful ranged touch attack. If it hits, the attack deals
      the target 1d4 points of force damage per 2 caster levels (max 5d4) and
      the anchor becomes firmly lodged in the target's torso.</p><p>The anchor
      has no weight, but its wide flukes prevent the target from moving through
      any space smaller than the creature's size. The anchor also prevents
      incorporeal targets from moving through solid objects. Whenever the target
      moves through a square occupied by another creature, the square counts as
      2 squares for the purpose of calculating movement, even if the square's
      occupant is the target's ally.</p>
