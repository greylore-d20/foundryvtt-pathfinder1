  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This trademark spell of the Lantern Bearers functions as <i>daylight</i>,
    except it lasts longer. In addition, as a swift action once during the
    spell's duration, you can will the light to try to end a magical darkness
    effect located within 60 feet of the light this spell emits. Attempt a
    dispel check (1d20 + your caster level), with a DC equal to 11 + the caster
    level of the darkness effect. If you succeed, the darkness effect ends.
    Regardless of whether you are successful, the light from this spell dims to
    the brightness of a torch for the spell's remaining duration.</p>
