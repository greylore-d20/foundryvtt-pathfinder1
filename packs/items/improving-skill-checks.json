      "value": "\r\n<p>Each dungeon guide can grant bonuses on up to three very specific skill checks both in and out of the dungeon. A PC who has ranks in the guide's associated skill can attempt a check with that skill while using the guide, which takes 1 minute. If she succeeds, she gains a <em>circumstance bonus</em> on one of the guide's listed skill checks (the amount of the bonus is listed with each skill), which the PC must make within 10 minutes. Failure indicates that the guide doesn't include helpful details pertaining to that specific check or that the PC was unable to understand the guide well enough to gain a bonus from it at that time. A PC cannot try again to improve a skill check, though she can attempt to gain the skill bonus on a different check. For example, a PC who fails to gain a bonus from her dungeon guide on dismantling a wooden <em>trap</em> may try to improve a later check with a different wooden <em>trap</em>. A PC cannot gain more than one bonus from a dungeon guide at a time.</p>\r\n"
