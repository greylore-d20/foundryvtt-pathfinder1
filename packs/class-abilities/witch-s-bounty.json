Each day at dawn, this blessed bush grows a number of&nbsp;goodberries&nbsp;equal to twice her witch level. Berries on the tree remain until they are picked, but the tree can never manifest a number of berries greater than twice her level at one time.</p>\n<p>The witch may only have one witch’s bounty active at a time, but can shift her blessing to a new plant with a ritual requiring 1 hour.</p>"
