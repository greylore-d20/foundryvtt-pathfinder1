This requires a successful DC 25 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check and 8 hours of work.</p>\r\n<p><b>Use</b> A creature that sleeps for at least 8 hours with a dose of <em>dream</em> lichen in contact with its body has vivid dreams in which it endures and recovers from a supernatural affliction. Upon waking, the creature can attempt a new saving throw against a single curse or <em>mind-affecting</em> effect from which it is currently suffering. Alternatively, the user automatically succeeds at a saving throw to remove a temporary <em>negative level</em>.</p>\r\n"
