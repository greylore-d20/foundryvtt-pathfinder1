  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can surround an ally with bolstering energies that supplement its
      health and grant it extra vigor. With a touch from you (a standard
      action), one creature gains a ward of restorative energy, granting it a
      number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma bonus + 1d6 per 2
      oracle levels you have (maximum 10d6). These temporary hit points last 1
      minute per oracle level you have.</p>

      <p>The target always loses these temporary hit points first, even before
      other temporary hit points (including those from, for example, the purify
      body spell on page 9 or a kineticistâ€™s force ward defense wild talent). If
      an attack deals fewer points of damage than the target has as temporary
      hit points from shell of succor, it still reduces those temporary hit
      points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that
      trigger on a hit or a miss.</p>

      <p>You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at
      11th and 19th levels.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 3rd level before selecting this revelation.</p>
