  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can make an unarmed touch attack against a
      creature. The target takes 1d4 points of fire damage + 1/2 your inquisitor
      level (minimum 1). If the target is currently the subject of a polymorph
      effect that changes its appearance (such as by alter self, shapechange, or
      an innate shapechanging ability such as that possessed by doppelgangers),
      it instead takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1/2 your inquisitor level
      (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3
      + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
