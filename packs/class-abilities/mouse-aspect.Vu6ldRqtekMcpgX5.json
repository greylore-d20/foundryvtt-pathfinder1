      "value": "<p><em>The aspect of the mouse offers the ability to gain access to hard-to-reach places while avoiding many attacks and effects.</em><p><b>Minor Form:</b> You gain evasion, as per the rogue class feature.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, this benefit becomes improved evasion, as per the rogue advanced talent.<p><b>Major Form:</b> Your shape changes to that of a Tiny mouse (as per the dire rat, but with a space of 2-1/2 feet and a reach of 0 feet; Bestiary 232). While in this form, you gain a base speed of 30 feet, a climb speed of 20 feet, a swim speed of 20 feet, lowlight vision, scent (30 feet), and a bite attack (1d4 damage), and you use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on Climb and Swim checks.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, your climb and swim speeds both increase to 40 feet.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity while moving through or out of a creatureâ€™s threatened area or moving into its space, but you do when you leave its space.<p><b>Alternate Natural Attacks:</b> Bite (B, P, S)</p>"
