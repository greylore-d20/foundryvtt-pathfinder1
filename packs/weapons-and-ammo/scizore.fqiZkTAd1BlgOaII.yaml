  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The scizore is a hardened tube that fits over the forearm, ending in a
      semicircular blade used for devastating bladed punch attacks. The scizore
      grants a +1 shield bonus to AC, but if you attack with the blade, you lose
      the AC bonus that round and take a -1 penalty on attack rolls with it.
      While wearing a scizore, you cannot use that hand for anything else. A
      scizore provides a +10 bonus to your CMD against being disarmed of your
      scizore. Donning a scizore is a full-round action.</p>
