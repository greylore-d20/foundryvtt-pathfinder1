  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other
      amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same
      linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus
      the full cost of the two other amplifications. She canâ€™t apply the same
      amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that
      amplification for multiple different effects.</p>
