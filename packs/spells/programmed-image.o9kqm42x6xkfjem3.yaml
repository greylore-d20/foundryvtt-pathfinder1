      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.kq916lznxo0ig68v]{silent image}, except
      that this spell's figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The
      figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements,
      including intelligible speech.</p><p>You set the triggering condition
      (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that
      triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as
      desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual
      trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious
      to the senses, such as alignment. See <em>magic mouth</em> for more
      details about such triggers.</p>
