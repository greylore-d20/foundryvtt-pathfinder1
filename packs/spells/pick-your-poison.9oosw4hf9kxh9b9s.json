If the subject is affected by a poison effect while under the effects of this spell, instead of the poison's normal effect, she feels intoxicated as if she'd just had a very strong drink and takes a -2 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks for the duration of the spell.</p><p>When the spell's duration expires, the penalty ends and the poison's normal effects apply. <i>Pick your poison</i> does not affect any poison effects that occurred before the spell was cast.</p>"
