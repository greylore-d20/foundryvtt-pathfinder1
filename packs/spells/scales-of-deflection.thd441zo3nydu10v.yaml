      <p>Brilliant draconic iconography matching your draconic heritage (or a
      kind of dragon whose alignment matches your own) surrounds you. Any touch
      attack attempted against you resolves against your normal AC. Once such an
      attack has been resolved, this spell is dismissed at the end of your next
      turn.</p>
