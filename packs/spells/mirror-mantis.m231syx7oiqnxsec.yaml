    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the target of this spell looks into a mirror or other
      reflective surface where it can see its own visage clearly, it sees a Red
      Mantis assassin (in full armor, face hidden by a mantis mask) looking back
      at it. The reflection is harmless and mimics the target's motions
      perfectly; no one else can see this illusion. The first time the target
      sees the Red Mantis reflection, it must succeed at a Will save be or
      shaken and take a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects for as long as
      it can see the altered image and for 3 rounds thereafter. A new save must
      be attempted each time the creature views its reflection during the
      spell's duration. Once a creature successfully saves, it becomes immune to
      being shaken by the caster's <i>mirror mantis</i> spell for 24 hours,
      though it will still see the Red Mantis reflection until the spell
      ends.</p>
