    value: >-
      <p>You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance
      on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a
      faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only
      those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made
      invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own
      side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in
      a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is
      clean, fresh, and warm.</p><p>You can create any floor plan you desire to
      the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains
      sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per
      caster level.</p><p>A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two
      per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The
      servants function as <i>unseen servant</i> spells except that they are
      visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.</p><p>Since the place can be
      entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect
      the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.</p>
