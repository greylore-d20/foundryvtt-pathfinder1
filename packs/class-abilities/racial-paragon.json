      "value": "<p>The vigilante can take a move action to gain the benefit of a feat with a racial prerequisite he meets but doesn’t have. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The vigilante must meet all the feat’s prerequisites. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 his vigilante level (minimum four times per day). The vigilante can use this ability again before the duration expires to replace a previous racial feat with another choice.<br><br>If a feat temporarily gained in this way has a daily use limitation, any uses of that feat while using this ability count toward that feat’s daily limit.<br><br>This vigilante talent can be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected after the first, the vigilante can use this ability to gain the benefits of one additional racial feat at the same time, or to reduce the action required to activate this talent by one step (a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes an immediate action). If the vigilante chooses to gain the benefits of multiple feats, the feats selected must share the same racial prerequisite. He can use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of a second feat; doing so means he cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another’s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.</p>"
