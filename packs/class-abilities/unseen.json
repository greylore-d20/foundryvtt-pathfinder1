This effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>You can expend 2 points of mental focus instead of 1 to use this power on a willing adjacent creature instead of yourself. You can still see creatures you make invisible with this power.</p>\n<p>If the invisible creature makes an attack or otherwise takes an action that would cause the invisibility to end, you can immediately expend 1 additional point of mental focus to allow the creature to remain invisible if the creature is within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>"
