      are crafted of metal-some are cast in one piece, others welded with iron
      bands-and mounted either in the ground or on wooden frames. Cannons use
      black powder to propel their projectiles with great force. A cannon has a
      misfire range of 1 (20 feet). Cannons have a hardness of 10 and 70 hit
      points. Cannon balls cost 30 gp each and weigh 25 pounds.</p>
