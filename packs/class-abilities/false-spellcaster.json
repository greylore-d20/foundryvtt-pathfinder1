      "value": "<p>The investigator can modify her extracts to be delivered as oils she can apply covertly to her skin. She can fake verbal or somatic components as she uses an extract this way to trick observers into thinking she cast a spell to produce the extract’s effect. She attempts a Bluff check to determine how convincing the ruse is. If observers attempt to determine the spell she is casting, those who succeed at a Spellcraft check opposed by her Bluff check realize the truth. Whether or not an observer recognizes what is going on, the DC to identify the effect of the extract is equal to 20 + the extract’s spell level. If the investigator has the infusion alchemist discovery, she can deliver her infusions with a range of touch, but the hint of residue grants targets a +2 bonus on the opposed Spellcraft check to realize she is not truly casting spells.</p>"
