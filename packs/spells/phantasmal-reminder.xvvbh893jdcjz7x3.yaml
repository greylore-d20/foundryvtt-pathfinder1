  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a memory loop of a successful attack made against the
      target, forcing its conscious mind to recall the details of the attack in
      such excruciating detail that its physical body is racked by the
      recollection. This spell can affect only a creature that has taken damage
      since the end of your last turn. The target first can attempt a Will save
      to recognize the attack as unreal. If it fails that saving throw, the
      target must succeed at a Fortitude save or take an amount of damage equal
      to 1d6 x your caster level (maximum 10d6). Because the damage is a
      quasi-real memory of existing wounds, this damage can't be reduced or
      prevented (such as by the <i>shield other</i> spell).  If the target of a
      <i>phantasmal reminder</i> attack succeeds at the Will save to disbelieve
      the memory loop and either has natural telepathy or is wearing a <i>helm
      of telepathy</i>, the memory of damage automatically rebounds to affect
      you. You must immediately attempt a Will save to disbelieve; if you fail,
      you take half the spell's damage yourself.</p>
