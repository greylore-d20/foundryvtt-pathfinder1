  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while
      wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing <em>armor</em>, he reduces the armor
      check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity
      bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th,
      and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum â€“4
      reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum
      <em>Dexterity</em> bonus allowed.</p><p>In addition, a fighter can also
      move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor.</p>
