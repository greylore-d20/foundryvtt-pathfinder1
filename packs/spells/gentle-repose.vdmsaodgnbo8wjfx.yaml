    value: >-
      <p>You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay.
      Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from
      the dead (see <i>raise dead</i>). Days spent under the influence of this
      spell don't count against the time limit.</p><p>Additionally, this spell
      makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less
      unpleasant.</p><p>The spell also works on severed body parts and the
      like.</p>
