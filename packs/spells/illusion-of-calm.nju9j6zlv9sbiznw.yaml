      <p>When casting this spell, you create an illusory double that takes the
      same space of you. That double makes it look like you are standing still,
      even when you are not. While under the effects of this spell, you do not
      provoke attacks of opportunity when you cast a spell, make a ranged attack
      with a thrown weapon, or move out of your first square during a move
      action. It does not hide ranged attacks made with any type of projectile
      weapon.  When a creature hits you with an attack of any type, it gains a
      saving throw to disbelieve the figment. On a successful saving throw, it
      successfully disbelieves and the spell's effect ends for that
      creature.</p>
