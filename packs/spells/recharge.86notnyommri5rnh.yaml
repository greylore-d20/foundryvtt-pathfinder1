    value: >-
      <p>You restore up to 1 charge per level to a battery or half that number
      of charges to a technological item capable of being charged by a battery.
      If you recharge a battery, there is a 20% chance that the battery is
      destroyed by the attempt. If you restore more charges than the item can
      hold, the item must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 points
      of electricity damage for each excess charge. This spell provides no
      knowledge of how many charges an item can safely hold, but you can choose
      to bestow fewer charges than the maximum allowed to reduce the risk; you
      must declare how many charges you are restoring before casting this
      spell.</p>
