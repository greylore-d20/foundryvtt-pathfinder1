  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the barbarian rages, her feverish frenzy and hot breath burn or
      blow fog, smoke and similar effects away from her. The barbarian and
      creatures adjacent to her do not gain concealment from obfuscating effects
      like fog or precipitation. Magical effects that require more than a strong
      wind to dissipate are not affected by this rage power.</p>
