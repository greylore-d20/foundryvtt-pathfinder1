Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a vampire hunter can take 10 on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically confirmed. A vampire hunter can have no more than one quarry at a time. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.
