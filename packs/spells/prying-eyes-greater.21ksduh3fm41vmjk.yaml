  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>prying eyes,</i> except that the eyes can
      see all things as they actually are, just as if they had <i>true
      seeing</i> with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened
      areas at normal speed. Also, a <i>greater prying eye</i>'s maximum
      Perception modifier is +25 instead of +15.</p>
