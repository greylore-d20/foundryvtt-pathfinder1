  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause the targets to forget all but the most general information
    about you. If they saw you or interacted with you, they still remember your
    presence and your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the gist of
    your interactions with them (such as "She was asking about the queen"), but
    they don't remember specifically what you said, details of your appearance,
    or any identifying information about you. This spell targets any memories of
    you in the minute preceding its casting, but is otherwise permanent.</p>
