    value: >-
      <p>This spell charges your hand with telekinetic force. Your successful
      melee touch attack deals 1d4 points of force damage per level (maximum
      10d4) and causes the target to be pushed away from you in a straight line
      up to 5 feet per two caster levels. For every size category of the target
      above Medium, reduce the distance pushed by 5 feet (-5 feet for Large, -10
      feet for Huge, -15 for Gargantuan, and -20 feet for Colossal) to a minimum
      of 0 feet. A successful Fortitude save negates the movement but not the
      damage.</p>
