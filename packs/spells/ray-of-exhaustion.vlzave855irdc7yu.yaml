      <p>A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a
      ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.</p><p>The subject is
      immediately exhausted for the spell's duration. A successful Fortitude
      save means the creature is only fatigued.</p><p>A character that is
      already fatigued instead becomes exhausted.</p><p>This spell has no effect
      on a creature that is already exhausted.</p><p>Unlike normal exhaustion or
      fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.</p>
