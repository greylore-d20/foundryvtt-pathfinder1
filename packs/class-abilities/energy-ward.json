      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to surround yourself in a swirling ward of energy. When you activate this power, you must select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain resistance 10 against that energy type, and whenever a creature hits you with a melee weapon or natural weapon, that creature takes 1d6 points of energy damage of the chosen type. Attacks made with melee weapons with reach don’t cause the attacker to take this damage.</p>\n<p>At 13th and 19th levels, the resistance granted by this ward increases by 5, to a maximum of resistance 20 at 19th level.</p>\n<p>The energy ward lasts for 1 round per occultist level.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>"
