  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You have become so attuned to the whispers of the natural world, from
      the croaking of frogs to the groaning of great boulders, that your
      surroundings constantly keep you preternaturally aware of danger. You may
      add your Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your
      Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause you to lose your
      Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class instead causes you to lose your
      Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.</p>
