  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a slayer with this talent deals sneak attack damage, he draws the
      target’s attention away from his allies. The affected enemy takes a –2
      penalty on attack rolls made against anyone other than the slayer for 1
      minute.</p>

      <p>The slayer must have the jaguar’s pounce talent to select this
      talent.</p>
