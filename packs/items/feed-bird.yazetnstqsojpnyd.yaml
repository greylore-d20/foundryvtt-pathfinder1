    value: >-
      <p>This mixture of seed and dead insects is suitable food for small birds
      such as <em>ravens</em>, crows, and chickens. Birds of prey such as
      falcons, <em>hawks</em>, and <em>owls</em> can also sustain themselves on
      bird feed, though they typically require at least two servings per day.
      Larger avian creatures such as <em>axe beaks</em> and <em>griffons</em>
      require larger portions of meat, and cannot survive on bird feed
      alone.</p>
