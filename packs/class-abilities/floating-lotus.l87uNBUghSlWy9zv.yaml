    value: >-
      <p>The witch can conjure a large lotus flower that floats by her side for
      a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration doesnâ€™t need
      to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. While
      summoned, the witch can use the lotus to cross water as if she was
      affected by @Compendium[pf1.spells.g2obld7y0lpyztes]{Water Walk}. She can
      also use the flower for short bursts of flight, gaining a +10 enhancement
      bonus on Acrobatics checks when attempting high jumps and long jumps.</p>

      <p>This bonus increases by 10 at 5th level, and again at 9th level.</p>
