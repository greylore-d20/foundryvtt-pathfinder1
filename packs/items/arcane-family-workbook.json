Older <em>elven</em> <em>wizards</em> take note of their own insights into the secrets of arcane magic and compile these thoughts with the ideas of earlier generations to form family workbooks. When used as a reference (an action that typically takes 1d4 full rounds of searching the text), an arcane family workbook grants a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on a <em>Spellcraft</em> checks. This bonus increases to +4 if 1d4 hours are spent referencing the book. <b>Price</b> 300 gp; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>\r\n"
