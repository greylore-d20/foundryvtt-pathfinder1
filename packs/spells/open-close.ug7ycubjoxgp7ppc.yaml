      <p>You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag,
      pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this
      activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails.
      In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds
      or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous
      creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.</p>
