  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These bullets are actually made from a porous stone or heavy wood that
      absorbs liquids and shatters on impact. Spongestones are often used to
      deliver poison or burning oil. A flask of oil completely saturates 10
      spongestones. When ignited (a free action if fire is available), a
      burning, oil-soaked spongestone deals +1d2 fire damage and can ignite
      combustible materials (such as a thatched roof ). Allowing a spongestone
      to burn in a sling's cup for more than 1d3 rounds gives the sling the
      broken condition.</p>
