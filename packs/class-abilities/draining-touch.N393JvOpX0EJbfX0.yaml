    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack to drain
      vitality from a creature. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a
      Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier)
      or take 1d2 points of Charisma damage. If a creature is affected, the
      colors of its skin, hair, and eyes dull and become less vibrant.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target
      of this power again for 24 hours. You regain 1 point in your phrenic pool
      each time you successfully drain a creature this way.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
