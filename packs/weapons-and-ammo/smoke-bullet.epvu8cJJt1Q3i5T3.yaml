      <h3>Description</h3><p>These sling stones require only a touch attack to
      succeed. When they strike a target, they burst, releasing a cloud of
      noxious gas that requires the creature struck to attempt a DC 13 Fortitude
      save. If the save fails, the target is nauseated for 2 rounds. A smoke
      bullets costs 100 gp.</p>
