  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.thh46ghi51lrl3cl]{resurrection} except
      that instead of recalling the dead soul to life, the spell calls a shadow
      demon with the advanced simple template (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>
      67, 294) to possess the body. If you fail to overcome the subject's spell
      resistance, the subject's soul can negate the calling and gain the option
      to return to life (as <em>resurrection</em>) in the restored body. The
      possession otherwise functions (as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.4mw83czf7b62rar3]{possession}) except
      that the subject's soul is not present to resist. When <em>false
      resurrection</em> ends or the demon is removed from the subject, the demon
      returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless (like that
      created by clone). If the soul hasn't been returned to life already, it
      has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still lives (as
      <em>resurrection</em>). If the body was killed, the demon is sent back to
      the Abyss but the subject remains dead.</p><p>Attempts to identify
      <em>false resurrection</em> with a skill check incorrectly identify it as
      <em>resurrection</em> (see the ruse descriptor on page 192). A fooled
      viewer mistakes <em>false resurrection</em>'s aura as the lingering aura
      of an instantaneous conjuration effect.</p>
