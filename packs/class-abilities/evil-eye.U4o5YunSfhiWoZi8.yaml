  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can cause doubt to creep into the mind of a foe within 30
      feet that she can see. The target takes a –2 penalty on one of the
      following (witch's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving
      throws, or skill checks. This hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3
      + the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save reduces this to just 1
      round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p>At 8th level the penalty increases to –4.</p>
