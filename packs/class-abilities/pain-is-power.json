If you succeed, you gain the benefits of a&nbsp;blessing of fervorAPG&nbsp;spell for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level. If you fail, this ability is expended with no effect. You can use this ability once at 8th level, plus an additional time for every 4 levels you are beyond 8th.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Scythe of Evil power of the Evil Domain or the Staff of Order power of the Law Domain.</p>"
