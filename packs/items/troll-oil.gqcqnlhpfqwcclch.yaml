      <p>This crimson liquid is viscous and tastes foul. If you drink it, for
      the next hour you automatically <em>stabilize</em> when reduced to
      negative <em>hit points</em> (unless the damage is sufficient to instantly
      kill you) and have a 50% chance each round to end any bleed effect on you.
      If you take fire or acid damage, the benefits of <em>troll</em> oil are
      suspended for 1 round.</p>
