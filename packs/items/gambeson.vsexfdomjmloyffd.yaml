    value: >-
      <p>This padded cloth jacket is often worn alone or with mail or plate
      armor and is favored by <em>hunters</em>, guards, and soldiers. A gambeson
      fitted with leather loops to more easily <em>attach</em> armor is called
      an arming doublet. Although sufficient to protect you against casual
      scrapes, it is not as thick as padded armor.</p>
