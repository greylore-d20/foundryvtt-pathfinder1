      <p>This spell functions as <i>telempathic</i> projectionOA, except its
      mood-altering effects remain dormant in the target's mind. Upon casting
      this spell, the caster designates a command word or phrase, of which the
      target retains no memory. The next creature to speak the command word or
      phrase to the target triggers the implanted <i>telempathic</i> projection,
      treating the speaker as the original spellcaster.</p>
