  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>dream</i>, but you and the target of your
    <i>dream</i> can converse in a limited fashion as long as the recipient is
    also asleep. You can send or receive a number of <i>dream</i> messages equal
    to your caster level. Each message can be up to 25 words long or a single
    vague image that can't convey fine details such as words. You can send and
    receive these <i>dream</i> messages with a single target or multiple
    targets, but each message you send or receive counts against the total
    number of messages allowed. Sending a message takes 1 round. The spell ends
    and you wake up when you run out of messages.  If you use <i>dream</i>
    council to send a message to a sleeping creature that has <i>dream</i> or
    <i>dream</i> council prepared (or is able to cast it spontaneously or as a
    spell-like ability), the recipient can expend one of your allotted messages
    to cast that spell while remaining asleep. This uses up that creature's
    prepared spell, spell per day, or spell-like ability use as normal. Instead
    of replying to your message, that character is able to enter your
    <i>dream</i>scape. If the sleeping recipient has the Lucid Dreamer feat, it
    can enter your <i>dream</i>scape without casting either of those spells.
    While in the original caster's <i>dream</i>scape, those involved in the
    council can interact with one another and that <i>dream</i>scape for 10
    minutes for each message remaining. When that time elapses, the spell
    ends.</p>
