    value: >-
      <p>A ring of fire surrounds the area affected by the spell. The flames
      radiate heat, but not enough to damage adjacent creatures. The flames deal
      [[/d 2d6]] points of fire damage to any creatures that pass through them
      (or [[/d 4d6]] points of damage to undead creatures). If you manifest a
      portion of the ring in a square that contains a creature, that creature
      takes damage as if it passed through the ring.</p><p>The ring of flames
      attempts to dispel all ongoing spell effects with the evil descriptor
      within it, targeting each spell effect once per round as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{dispel magic}. Any attempt to
      cast a spell with the evil descriptor inside the ring of flames is
      targeted by a <em>dispel magic</em> affect that attempts to counterspell
      the <em>evil</em> spell.</p>
