    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that deals
      1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two oracle levels you
      possess. At 7th level, the touched creature must also make a Fortitude
      saving throw or be fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
      oracle level. This has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued.
      You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Charisma modifier.</p>
