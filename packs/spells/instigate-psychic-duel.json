    "shortDescription": "<p>You begin a psychic duel (see page 202) with a creature. This psychic duel takes place on a binary mindscape (see page 235) that includes only two minds: yours and the target's. This spell ends and both minds return to their respective bodies if one of you drops below 0 hit points or if both of you agree to end the psychic duel (a free action that you can perform even if it isn't your turn).  Even if you cast the spell, you must succeed at a Will save to escape your own psychic duel if your opponent doesn't want to allow you to leave. Spells like <i>mindscape door</i> can also free you from the mindscape (and <i>mindscape door</i> is one of the few spells you can cast in a binary mindscape). A binary mindscape is clearly illusory, and disbelieving the illusion doesn't alter how the mindscape works.</p>",
