  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent uses various devious techniques, including
      mental exercises and dusting her clothing with a small amount of lead, to
      protect herself from divinations, with the same benefits as if she cast
      nondetection on herself with a caster level equal to her character
      level.</p>
