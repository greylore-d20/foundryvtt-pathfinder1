      "value": "<p>As a full-round action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to gain insight into an object in your possession. You can ask one question, but that question must be tied in some way to the object, such as the nature of its power, the identity of the creature that last possessed it, or even where the object was when a certain event took place. You always receive an answer from the psychic impressions imprinted upon the item, but they are sometimes cryptic or misleading. This ability otherwise functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.p2kosvizylhy8vfa]{Commune}.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>"
