      <p>The dwarven pelletbow is a crossbowlike weapon that is loaded with and
      fires sling bullets rather than bolts. A dwarven heavy pelletbow takes the
      same amount of time and effort to load as a light crossbow (normally a
      move action), and a dwarven light pelletbow can be reloaded as a free
      action (allowing characters to attack with it multiple times in a round).
      Normally a pelletbow takes two hands to operate, but you can shoot (but
      not load) a pelletbow with one hand by taking a -2 penalty on attack
      rolls. You can shoot one pelletbow with each hand, but you take a penalty
      on attack rolls for attacking with two weapons (treating the heavy
      pelletbow as a one-handed weapon and the light pelletbow as a light
      weapon).</p><p>Feats and special abilities that don't involve proficiency
      (that don't depend on dealing piercing damage or firing bolts) that apply
      to a heavy crossbow also apply to a dwarven heavy pelletbow, and those
      that apply to a light crossbow also apply to a dwarven light
      pelletbow.</p>
