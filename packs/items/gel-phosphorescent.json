Once the vial's seal is broken, the liquid reacts with the surrounding air and begins to rapidly heat up, glowing like a candle for 1 hour. After that hour, the oxidization of the chemical agent is complete, and the gel dissolves in a white-hot flash, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage to anything directly in contact with it. A single dose of phosphorescent gel can coat 6 square inches of a surface. Multiple doses of phosphorescent gel can be used to coat larger surfaces, but the amount of damage dealt does not stack. The conflagration occurs in an instant, and the fire generated doesn't spread, though it can be used to ignite a larger explosive such as a fuse grenade or pot of oil.</p>\r\n"
