    value: >-
      <p>Undead are immune to death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects
      (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms), paralysis,
      poison, sleep, stun, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless
      the effect also works on objects or is harmless). Undead are not subject
      to ability drain, energy drain, or nonlethal damage. Undead are immune to
      damage or penalties to their physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity,
      and Constitution), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects. Undead
      are not at risk of death from massive damage.</p><p><em>Format:</em>
