All creatures within 20 feet also become sickened (Fortitude negates), and remain sickened for as long as they remain within 20 feet of the target and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that strikes the target with a bite attack must succeed at an additional save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected.</p>"
