  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Barkskin</i> toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2
      enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This
      enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd,
      to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.</p><p>The enhancement bonus provided by
      <i>barkskin</i> stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with
      other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural
      armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.</p>
