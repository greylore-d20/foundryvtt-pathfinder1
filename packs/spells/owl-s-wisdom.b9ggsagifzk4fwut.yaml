    value: >-
      <p>The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4
      enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related
      skills. Clerics, druids, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters)
      who receive owl's wisdom do not gain any additional bonus spells for the
      increased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells increase.</p>
