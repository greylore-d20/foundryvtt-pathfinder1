    value: >-
      <p>You cause the air in the area to ripple where creatures have flown
      through it up to 1 day ago per caster level. These aerial ripples are
      tinged by glowing wisps, providing enough illumination to follow the
      tracks without penalties due to poor lighting. The area moves with you,
      allowing you to follow the tracks through the air over long distances
      provided you can fly or follow the route along the ground within range to
      read the aerial tracks. Other creatures can also follow the trail as long
      as they move with you. The base DC of Survival checks to track creatures
      through the air with this spell is the same as tracking creatures across
      soft ground.</p>
