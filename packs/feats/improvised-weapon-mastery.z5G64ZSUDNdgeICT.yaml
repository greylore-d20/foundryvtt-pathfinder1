  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>You can turn nearly any object into a deadly weapon, from a
      razor-sharp chair leg to a sack of
      flour.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.bZ1YdzkT8NtRIEJ4]{Catch Off-Guard} or
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.gGfXQq0IZrxdcZDx]{Throw Anything}, base
      attack bonus +8.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You do not suffer any
      penalties for using an improvised weapon. Increase the amount of damage
      dealt by the improvised weapon by one step (for example, 1d4 becomes 1d6)
      to a maximum of 1d8 (2d6 if the improvised weapon is two-handed). The
      improvised weapon has a critical threat range of 19–20, with a critical
      multiplier of ×2.</p>
