      "value": "<p>Once per day, the rogue can weave a bit of old Varisian magic into her footwork, dancing with an infectious passion that compels another nearby to join in. The rogue can target one humanoid within 30 feet and attempt a Perform (dance) check as a full-round action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Her target must succeed at a Will save (DC equal to the rogue’s Perform [dance] check) or it begins to dance uncontrollably. So long as the rogue continues to spend a full-round action dancing each round, the affected target does so as well. If the target is attacked or otherwise in immediate danger while dancing, the effect ends. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt an Acrobatics or Perform (dance) check or a Will save (target’s choice) against the rogue’s Perform (dance) check to end the effect. A target who resists the jig can not be affected by the same rogue’s jig for 24 hours. The grig jig is a mind-affecting effect. The rogue must have an Intelligence score of at least 12 to select this talent. A rogue can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses.</p>"
