  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are forewarned of danger but can’t act to prevent it. You gain
      uncanny dodge, as the rogue class feature. However, you can’t take any
      actions in a surprise round, including free actions, except for flash of
      insight. In the absence of a surprise round, you are staggered for the
      entire first round of combat.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, you gain a +4 insight bonus on initiative checks.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, you gain improved uncanny dodge as the rogue ability,
      using your oracle level as your rogue level.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, you gain a +4 insight bonus on all your saving throws
      and to your AC during surprise rounds and when you are otherwise unaware
      of an attack.</p>
