      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can call upon Torag’s protection to form a shield around you that blocks incoming attacks for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1). The shield grants a +4 deflection bonus to your Armor Class.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, and again at 11th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1.</p>\n<p>At 19th level, the shield also grants you DR 2/chaos. The shield’s duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>"
