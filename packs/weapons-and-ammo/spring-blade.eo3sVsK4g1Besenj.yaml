  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This 4-inch blade is attached via a hinge to a wooden handle with a
      slot in the center, into which the blade can be folded. With a click of a
      switch, a spring thrusts the blade outward, where it locks into place
      until it is reset. Releasing the blade is a free action, and resetting it
      is a move action. The handle must be in your hand for the blade to be
      released; placing it in your hand requires the same type of action as
      drawing a weapon. A spring blade is easy to conceal: an observer must
      succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the blade hidden within the
      wooden handle, and you gain a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to
      conceal a spring blade on your body.</p>
