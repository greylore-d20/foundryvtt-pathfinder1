  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your physical control and mastery of momentum allows you to throw
      enemies.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.gTrGPxzN054GfpkM]{Improved Trip},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed
      Strike}.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: On a successful unarmed trip
      attack against a target your size or smaller, you may throw the target
      prone in any square you threaten rather than its own square. This movement
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you cannot throw the creature
      into a space occupied by other creatures.</p><p><strong>Special</strong>:
      A monk may gain Ki Throw as a bonus feat at 10th level. A monk with this
      feat can affect creatures larger than his own size by spending 1 ki point
      per size category difference.</p><h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>You can spend 5
      stamina points to throw a creature one size category larger than you.</p>
