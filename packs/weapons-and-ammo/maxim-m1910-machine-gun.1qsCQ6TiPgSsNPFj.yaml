      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This heavy machine gun uses 7.62 54mmR ammunition in 250-round belts.
      Although a single person can fire a Maxim, it typically has a two-person
      crew: the gunner, and a loader who assists with feeding the ammunition
      belt into the weapon.</p>

      <p>As a full-round action, the loader can use a special aid another action
      to grant the gunner a +2 bonus on his next attack roll. Because of its
      size and heavy weight, a Maxim is often either mounted on a wheeled
      chassis with a gun shield for trench defensive use, or on the back of a
      horse-drawn wagon called a tachanka (see page 67).</p>

      <p>Assuming a user can even lift the weapon, firing a Maxim M1910 machine
      gun that is not mounted imparts a -4 penalty on attack rolls and the
      recoil knocks the wielder prone. The Maxim M1910 is automatic-fire
      only.</p>

      <p>The armored shield provides cover when firing the weapon from the prone
      position.</p>
