      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.bacuzpculp9tld48]{shout}, except that the
      cone deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 1d6 points of sonic damage per
      caster level, maximum 20d6, against exposed brittle or crystalline objects
      or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1
      round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. A creature in the area of the cone can
      negate the stunning and halve both the damage and the duration of the
      deafness with a successful Fortitude save. A creature holding vulnerable
      objects can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage to those
      objects.</p>
