  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You seize control of a summoned creature by disrupting the bond between
    it and the caster who summoned it. If the creature fails its save, you may
    command it as if you had summoned it. The original caster can attempt to
    regain control of the creature as a standard action by making an opposed
    Spellcraft check against you. When your spell ends, control reverts to the
    original summoner. If the summoning spell ends before this spell ends, the
    remaining duration of this spell is lost.</p>
