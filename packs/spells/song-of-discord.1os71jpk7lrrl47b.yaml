    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather
      than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack
      the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior
      every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack
      its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures
      forced by a <i>song of discord</i> to attack their fellows employ all
      methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most
      advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have
      fallen unconscious.</p>
