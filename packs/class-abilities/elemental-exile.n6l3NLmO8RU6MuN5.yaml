      <p>You transport a single creature you touch to the plane associated with
      your element. Precise accuracy regarding a particular arrival location on
      the intended plane is almost impossible. The creature appears 5 to 500
      miles (5d%) from your intended destination. Elemental exile transports
      creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creature must find other
      means to travel back (such as casting
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.q3st18udsalnyz5v]{Plane Shift} or using elemental
      exile again).</p>
