  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A 1-inch-thick slab of stone springs up from the ground, interposing
      itself between you and an opponent of your choice. The <i>stone shield</i>
      provides you with cover from that enemy (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 195) until
      the beginning of your next turn, granting you a +4 bonus to Armor Class
      and a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws. If the opponent's attack misses
      you by 4 or less, the attack strikes the shield instead. The <i>stone
      shield</i> has hardness 8 and 15 hit points. If the shield is destroyed,
      the spell ends and the shield crumbles away into nothingness. Spells and
      effects that damage an area deal damage to the shield.  You cannot use
      this spell if you are not adjacent to a large area of earth or stone such
      as the ground or a wall. At 4th level, a qinggong monk (<i>Ultimate</i>
      Magic) may select this spell as a ki power costing 1 ki point to
      activate.</p>
