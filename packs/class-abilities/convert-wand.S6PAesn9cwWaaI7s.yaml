    value: >-
      <p>An arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a full-round
      action to convert one wand that is in her possession into a wand of a cure
      spell with the same spell level and caster level (a cure spell is any
      spell with “cure” in its name). For example, she could convert a <em>wand
      of stone shape</em> into a <em>wand of cure serious
      wounds</em>.</p><p>This alteration lasts for 1 minute, after which the
      wand reverts to its original function. Charges expended while the wand was
      altered are still expended when it reverts.</p>
