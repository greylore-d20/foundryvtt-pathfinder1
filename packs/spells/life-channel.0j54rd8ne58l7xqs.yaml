    value: >-
      <p>When cast on a creature with negative energy affinity, the target is
      able to convert channeled positive energy into temporary hit points. When
      subject to an effect that heals hit points only to living creatures (such
      as <i>cure light wounds</i> or channel positive energy), the target gains
      a number of temporary hit points equal to half the number of hit points
      that the positive energy would normally heal. These temporary hit points
      go away at the end of this spell's duration.</p>
