      "value": "<p>You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, bracing it against frightening situations and allowing it to remain calm. The first fear effect that would affect the subject within the next hour is suppressed for the first 1d4 rounds of its effect. If you touch a creature currently suffering from an ongoing fear effect, this ability instead suppresses the ongoing fear effect for 1 round. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering fear effect still count against the effect’s duration. If the fear effect is suppressed for longer than it lasts, the subject isn’t affected by the fear effect at all. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Touch of Glory power of the Glory Domain.</p>"
