  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You channel your magical power to fuel the target's
    spellcasting.</p><p>The next spell the target casts of 3rd level or lower
    does not expend a spell slot; in effect, you are using your spell slot to
    power the target's spell. The target must start casting this spell before
    your next turn, and the spell cannot have a casting time longer than 1 full
    round. Your alignment, prohibited wizard school, and other restrictions on
    your own spellcasting do not affect the target, nor do you suffer any
    backlash from the target's choice of spell.</p><p>If you target yourself
    with this spell, you may spontaneously cast any prepared spell of 3rd level
    or lower without expending its spell slot on your next turn (this aspect of
    the spell has no effect if you are a spontaneous caster). The spell that's
    cast after <i>Channel the Gift</i> cannot have a casting time longer than 1
    full round.</p>
