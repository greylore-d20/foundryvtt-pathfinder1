  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can charge and throw a pebble (or other stone
      of similar size) that detonates when it strikes a target as a ranged
      attack. The pebble has a range increment of 20 feet and has a +1
      enhancement bonus to attack and damage for every four oracle levels you
      possess. Any creature struck by the pebble takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage per two oracle levels you possess (minimum 1d6). Creatures in
      squares adjacent to the target take half damage, or no damage if they make
      a Reflex saving throw. If the attack roll misses, treat the pebble as a
      thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
      at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
