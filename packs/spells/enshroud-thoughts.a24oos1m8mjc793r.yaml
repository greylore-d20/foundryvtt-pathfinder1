      <p>You become warded against the mental prying of others, including the
      effects of divination spells such as <i>detect thoughts</i> and
      <i>seek</i> thoughtsAPG, as well as enchantment spells such as <i>modify
      <i>memory</i></i> and <i>memory</i> lapseAPG. If another creature attempts
      to target you with a mind-affecting spell that  detects or alters your
      thoughts or memories, the caster must succeed at a caster level check
      against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level or the spell fails. Only
      spells that detect or alter your thoughts or memories are blocked by this
      spell; effects such as <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>, <i>d etect e
      vil</i>, and <i>locate creature</i> continue to affect you as normal.</p>
