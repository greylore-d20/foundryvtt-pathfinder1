    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell has two different applications, both of which control water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas.</p><p><i>Lower Water</i>: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a <i>slow</i> spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.</p><p><i>Raise Water</i>: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the <i>lower water</i> version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.</p><p>With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change the overall area of effect.</p>",
