    value: >-
      <p>You unleash all the target's anger and destructive urges, causing it to
      fly into a violent bloodlust. The target attacks creatures as determined
      by the following table. If a creature is killed or the target is for some
      reason unable to effectively attack it, roll on the table again to select
      a new action for the target. </p><table
      border="1"><tbody><tr><th>d%</th><th>Behavior</th></tr><tr><td>1-25</td><td>Target
      attacks the creature nearest to it.</td></tr><tr><td>26-75</td><td>Target
      attacks its nearest ally.</td></tr><tr><td>76-100</td><td>Target always
      attacks the last creature to attack it.</td></tr></tbody></table>
      Beginning on its next turn, the target attacks the subject determined by
      the chart with a melee weapon, natural weapon, or supernatural ability
      that deals damage. If necessary, it moves to or charges to the subject in
      order to make this attack. If it is unable to reach its subject on its
      next turn, the target uses its turn to get as close as possible to the
      subject of its bloodlust. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and
      damage rolls, and cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or
      Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride)
      or any abilities that require patience or concentration. This spell is
      otherwise treated as <i>confusion</i> and <i>rage</i>-any creature immune
      to <i>confusion</i> or <i>rage</i> is immune to this spell, and any
      ability or effect that ends <i>confusion</i> or <i>rage</i> (such as
      <i>calm</i> emotions) can end this spell.  Antipaladins,
      blood<i>rage</i>rs, clerics, and inquisitors who worship Dahak add Dahak's
      release to their spell lists as a 4th-level spell.<p></p>
