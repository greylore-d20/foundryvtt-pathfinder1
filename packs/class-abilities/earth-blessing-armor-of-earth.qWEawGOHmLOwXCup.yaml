  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you can touch an ally and harden its armor or clothing.
      For 1 minute, the ally gains DR 1/—. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, this
      DR increases by 1 (to a maximum of DR 5/— at 18th level).</p>

      <p>This doesn’t stack with any other damage resistance.</p>
