  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not
      through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus
      an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at
      12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If
      the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a
      single <i>passwall</i> simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several
      <i>passwall</i> spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very
      thick walls. When <i>passwall</i> ends, creatures within the passage are
      ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the <i>passwall</i> or
      you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if
      there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.</p>
