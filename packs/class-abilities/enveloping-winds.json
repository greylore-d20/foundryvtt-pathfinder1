      "value": "<p><strong>Element</strong>&nbsp;air;&nbsp;<strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;defense (Su);&nbsp;<strong>Level</strong>&nbsp;—;&nbsp;<strong>Burn</strong>&nbsp;0</p>\n<p>You constantly surround yourself with a whirling torrent of air, crackling arcs of lightning, or both to protect yourself from ranged attacks. All ranged attacks made with physical weapons suffer a 20% miss chance against you, except for attacks from massive weapons such as a giant’s thrown boulder or a ballista. This ability has no effect on ray attacks.</p>\n<p>The miss chance increases by 5% for every 5 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the miss chance by 5% until the next time your burn is removed. You can continue to accept points of burn to increase the miss chance further, up to a maximum of 75%.</p>\n<p>Whenever you accept burn while using an air wild talent, the energy surging through you causes your enveloping winds to also affect non-physical ranged attacks such as ray attacks for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.</p>"
