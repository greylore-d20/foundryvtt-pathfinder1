  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can cause a creature to become <em>shaken</em> as a
      melee touch attack. This effect persists for a number of rounds equal to
      1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). Creatures <em>shaken</em> by this
      ability radiate an aura of evil, as if they were an evil outsider (see
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.tr7m97npkbgm4wp7]{Detect Evil}). Multiple touches
      do not stack, but they do add to the duration. You can use this ability a
      number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier.</p>
