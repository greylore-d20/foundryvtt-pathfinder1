    value: >-
      <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you place the mask used
      as the focus component on the target's face, after which it adheres
      tightly to the target for the spell's duration and cannot be removed by
      physical force. Despite lacking eyes, this mask does not impair its
      wearer's vision in any way. While in effect, this spell functions like
      <i>nondetection</i>, except it also foils divination spells that attempt
      to gather information about the creature, even if they don't target it
      specifically. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal
      the wearer's presence, such as <i>see invisibility</i>, the spell works,
      but the wearer is detected only if the caster succeeds at a caster level
      check. Likewise, scrying attempts that specifically target the wearer do
      not work at all unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check. In
      addition, the DCs of skill checks to learn about the wearer or identify
      the wearer and its strengths and weaknesses- including Diplomacy checks to
      gather information, Perception checks opposed by the target's Disguise
      checks, and Knowledge checks-increase by 4. The mask cannot be removed for
      the duration of the spell, and the fact that the target is wearing the
      focus mask cannot be hidden in any way from creatures that observe the
      target.</p>
