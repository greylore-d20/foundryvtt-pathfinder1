    value: >-
      <p>You create a pale silver barrier that repels undead. Mindless undead
      and intelligent undead with fewer Hit Dice than your caster level cannot
      enter the area or penetrate the barrier.</p><p>Undead of Hit Dice equal to
      or greater than your caster level can pass through this barrier by making
      a successful Will save against the spell, but as they do so, they take 3d6
      points of damage. Once an undead creature makes its save again this spell
      and takes this damage, it can come and go without further penalty. This
      spell may only be used defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an undeath
      ward against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the
      barrier.</p>
