      <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> In order to prepare this spell, the caster must
      spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches <b>Kols</b>.
      Further details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of
      Golarion.</em></p><p>This spell seals a solemn vow between two creatures.
      When this spell is cast, the targets must clasp hands and swear their oath
      in Kols's name. The spell functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.3jaumkutti1ytulq]{mark of justice}, except as noted
      above and rather than being cursed, the oath-breaker gains a mark on the
      face indicating to all dwarves who see it that the target has broken a
      sacred oath, which gives the oath-breaker a -4 penalty to influence
      dwarves. The mark can be removed as described in the <em>mark of
      justice</em> spell, or the other target can forgive the oath-breaker,
      which causes the mark to vanish.</p>
