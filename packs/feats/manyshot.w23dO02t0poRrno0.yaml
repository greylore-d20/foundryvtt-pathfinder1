      <i>You can fire multiple arrows at a single target.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Dex 17, Point-Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires
      two arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based
      damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this
      attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength
      bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as a ranger's
      favored enemy bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to
      each arrow.</p>
