    value: >-
      <p>You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The
      weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a
      critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round
      with no saving throw.</p><p>This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged
      weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its
      ammunition.</p><p>You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you
      can cast it on an unarmed strike.</p>
