    value: >-
      <p>The target believes everyone it sees is an enemy. The target becomes
      hostile to all creatures, treating all creatures as enemies and only
      itself as an ally. The target must attempt attacks of opportunity whenever
      any creature provokes them. Finally, whenever the target is adjacent to
      two or more creatures, its paranoia overwhelms it, and it takes a -2
      penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability checks, skill
      checks, and saving throws.</p>
