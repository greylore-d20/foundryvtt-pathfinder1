  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A bard of 8th level or higher can use his performance to foster a sense
      of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to take become
      <em>shaken</em>. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able
      to see and hear the bardâ€™s performance. The effect persists for as long as
      the enemy is within 30 feet and the bard continues the performance. The
      performance cannot cause a creature to become <em>frightened</em> or
      <em>panicked</em>, even if the targets are already <em>shaken</em> from
      another effect. Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting <em>fear</em> effect,
      and it relies on audible and visual <em>components</em>.</p>
