      <p>At 8th level, when you make a Disable Device or Sleight of Hand check,
      you can roll twice and take the higher result. Using this ability is a
      free action. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one
      additional time per day for every 2 levels beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Master's Illusion power of the Trickery
      Domain.</p>
