      "value": "<p><b>Requirements:</b> Summoner level 11th.</p>\n<p>The eidolon becomes unsettling to its foes, gaining the frightful presence ability. The eidolon can activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or attack. Opponents within 30 feet of the eidolon must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s Hit Dice + the eidolon’s Charisma modifier. If the eidolon has at least 4 more Hit Dice than an opponent that fails this save, that opponent becomes frightened instead.</p>\n<p>Foes with more Hit Dice than the eidolon are immune to this effect.</p>"
