    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and bless it with the power of
      purity and goodness. For 1 minute, this weapon glows green, white, or
      yellow-gold and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against evil
      creatures. During this time, it’s treated as good for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction. This additional damage doesn’t stack with the
      additional damage from the holy weapon special ability.</p>
