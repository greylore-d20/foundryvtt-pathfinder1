  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell was developed by an Aldori Academy student after several
      weeks of observing (and occasionally joining) Restov barroom brawls. You
      draw on your mind's hidden reserves, instantaneously mastering advanced
      combat techniques. When you cast this spell, choose a combat feat. You
      must meet all prerequisites for this feat, treating your magus level as
      your base attack bonus for this purpose. For the duration of this spell,
      you are treated as if you had the chosen feat. Once you cast this spell,
      you cannot change the chosen feat (or any decisions related to that feat)
      for additional castings of this spell on the same day. A creature can
      benefit from only one <i>tactical adaptation</i> spell at a time.</p>
