  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the shaman violently probes the mind of a single
      intelligent enemy within 30 feet. The target can attempt a Will saving
      throw to negate the effect. If it succeeds, it immediately knows the
      source of the mental prying; otherwise, it’s wracked with pain and takes
      1d4 points of damage for every 2 levels the shaman possesses. On the round
      following her successful use of this ability, the shaman can take a
      fullround action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and
      memories to attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim’s bonus with
      that skill. The random stolen thoughts remain in the shaman’s mind for a
      number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and she can
      treat the knowledge gained as if she used detect thoughts. This is a
      mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p>Once she successfully affects a creature, she cannot use this hex on
      that creature again for 24 hours.</p>
