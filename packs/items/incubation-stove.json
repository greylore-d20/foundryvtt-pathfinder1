It burns wood, coal, dung, or fungus stalks, and has a large moveable compartment on the outside to hold maturing <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-list/magical-beasts/owlbear\">owlbear</a> eggs. The stoves need constant attention to maintain the right temperature, else the eggs get cooked rather than incubated. Some variations have a spring- or crank-turned device that turns the eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n"
