    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can create a vortex of turbulent wind around yourself
      as a standard action. This vortex has a radius of up to 10 feet and a
      maximum height of 10 feet per wizard level you possess. Any ranged attack
      passing through this vortex automatically misses. Any flying creature
      moving through the vortex must make a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.iH69GIwm8BjecrPN]{Fly}
      skill check or immediately fall from the sky, taking falling damage (the
      creature cannot make a Fly check to reduce or negate this damage).
      Creatures on the ground cannot pass through the vortex without first
      making a Strength check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your caster
      level. The vortex is faintly visible and can be spotted with a DC 15
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.2h6hz5AkTDxKPFxr]{Perception}
      skill check. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal
      to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
