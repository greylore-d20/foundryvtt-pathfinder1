    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can blend into the shadows of the night,
      becoming nearly invisible. As long as you are in an area of dim light or
      darkness, you are invisible (as per invisibility) to creatures without
      darkvision. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
      cleric level (minimum 1). You can use this ability for a number of times
      per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Touch of Darkness power of the Darkness
      Domain.</p>
