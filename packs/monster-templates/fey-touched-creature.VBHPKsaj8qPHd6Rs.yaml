      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Inherited<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes - Spellcasters with ties to the fey
      (such as sorcerers with the fey bloodline) can summon fey-touched
      creatures with summon monster spells<p>Fey-touched creatures are descended
      from inhabitants of the First World and often possess striking features
      compared to their normal counterparts, such as bright coloration or a
      cunning visage. The fey-touched creature's First World ancestor needn't be
      a fey specifically, and even magical beasts, First World gnomes, and other
      non-fey inhabitants of the fecund, magical plane can produce fey-touched
      heirs generations after their initial dalliance with residents of other
      planes. Some fey-touched creatures thus claim to be descended from the
      legendary Tane and even the godlike Eldest, though these claims are likely
      unfounded — such claims themselves intentional or accidental
      manifestations of the creature's hereditary First World influence.<p>A
      fey-touched creature's CR increases by 1 only if the base creature has 5
      or more Hit Dice. The fey-touched creature template can be applied only to
      living creatures. A fey-touched creature's quick and rebuild rules are the
      same. Spellcasters with ties to the fey (such as sorcerers with the fey
      bloodline) can summon fey-touched creatures with summon monster spells and
      take fey-touched creatures as improved familiars at 3rd level, similar to
      selecting celestial or infernal familiars.<p><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> Senses
