      <p>Larger than even giant geckos, these mammoth lizards have been
      specifically bred to be used as mounts. Prized for their ability to run
      along cave ceilings and sheer walls, they require exotic saddles to ride.
      A riding gecko has the same statistics as a giant gecko with the giant
      template (see <em>Bestiary 3</em>).</p>
