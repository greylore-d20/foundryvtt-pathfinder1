  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This treated wafer dissolves into a chalky paste when placed under the
      tongue and then gives the imbiber a jolt of restless energy. It eliminates
      the effects of <em>fatigue</em> for the next 8 hours; when the drug's
      effect ends, the user is <em>exhausted</em>. Allnight makes its users
      jittery and unable to focus; they suffer a -2 penalty on all skill checks
      until its effects wear off.</p>
