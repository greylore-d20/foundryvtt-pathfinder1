  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This tool is a wide, single-edged blade about 2 feet in length. Most
      often used to hack through dense vegetation, it works equally well as a
      weapon. A character proficient with a machete gains a +1 circumstance
      bonus on Survival checks to get along in the wild.</p>
