      <p>You conjure a tremendous area of shadow to obscure moonlight within the
      area, creating something akin to a lunar eclipse. The light level is
      lowered by two steps (though unlike <i>deeper darkness</i>, areas of
      normal light or dimmer become normal darkness rather than supernaturally
      dark).</p><p>Lycanthropes in the area must make a Will save every round or
      revert to their humanoid forms. In addition, lycanthropes attempting to
      assume animal or hybrid form within the affected area take a -5 penalty on
      Constitution checks to do so.</p>
