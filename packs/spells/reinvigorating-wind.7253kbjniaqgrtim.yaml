      <p>You exhale deeply, creating a gentle magical wind that invigorates any
      allies in the affected area, as follows. Any sleeping allies immediately
      wake up. Fascinated allies are shaken free of the fascinate effect.
      Flat-footed allies no longer count as flat-footed even if they have not
      acted yet. The duration of effects that cause any allies to be confused,
      frightened, paralyzed, slowed, or stunned is decreased by 1d4 rounds (roll
      separately for each target). If the duration of any such effect is reduced
      to 0 rounds or fewer, the effect ends for that ally. Finally, any allies
      lying prone may stand up as an immediate action, provoking attacks of
      opportunity as normal.</p>
