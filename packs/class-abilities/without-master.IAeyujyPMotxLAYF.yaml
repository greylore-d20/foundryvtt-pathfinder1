  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the ronin's fierce independence allows him to overcome
      staggering odds. The ronin can summon up this willpower as an immediate
      action, and can use it in one of three ways. He can use his willpower
      whenever an attack would reduce him to fewer than 0 hit points but
      wouldn't kill him, to instead be at 1 hit point and conscious. He can use
      his willpower after making an attack roll to confirm a critical hit in
      order to reroll the confirmation roll. Finally, he can use his willpower
      to take 10 on a skill check during combat, even if the situation or the
      skill would not normally allow him to take 10. A ronin can use this
      ability once during a combat.</p>
