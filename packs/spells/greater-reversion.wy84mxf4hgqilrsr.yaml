      <p>You create a fine-tuned replica of yourself within the Akashic Record
      at the time the spell is cast. You must currently have a number of hit
      points equal to or greater than half your maximum hit points to cast the
      spell. If at any time during the duration of the spell you are brought
      below half your maximum hit points, you can end this spell as an immediate
      action to absorb strength from your replica and immediately regain a
      number of hit points equal to 3d8 plus 1 point per caster level (maximum
      +15).</p>
