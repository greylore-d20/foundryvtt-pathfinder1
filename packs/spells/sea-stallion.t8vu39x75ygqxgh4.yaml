      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.uaznzgoz4h9bw9fr]{sea steed}, but as long
      as you stay mounted on the target, you also gain the amphibious quality
      and your melee attacks function as if you were under the effect of
      <em>freedom of movement</em>. The benefits you gain from this spell are
      not polymorph effects. If you dismount from the target, you retain the
      amphibious quality for up to 1 minute, but not the other benefits. You
      regain all of the benefits once you mount the target creature again.</p>
