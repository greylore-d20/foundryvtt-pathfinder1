The witch chooses one of the following conditions each time she uses this hex: dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or sickened. If the target is or later becomes afflicted with the chosen condition, that condition is suppressed for a number of minutes equal to the witch’s level.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the witch can grant her target a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against effects that cause any two of the listed conditions (which condition is always the witch’s choice) for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from the hex again for 24 hours.</p>"
