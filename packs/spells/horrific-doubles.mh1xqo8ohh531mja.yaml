  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each
      image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as
      <i>mirror image</i>, except as noted.  Each creature that can see the
      doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can
      see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken
      condition  and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this
      spell (beyond the usual effects of <i>mirror image</i>). In addition, the
      first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of
      the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double
      shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker,
      the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing
      the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of
      Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock. Both additional effects are
      mind-affecting fear effects, and spell resistance applies against them. 
      If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a creature takes
      1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.</p>
