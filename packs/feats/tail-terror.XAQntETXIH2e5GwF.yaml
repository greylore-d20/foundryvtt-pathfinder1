      <p><em>You have strengthened your tail enough to make slap attacks with
      it.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Base attack bonus +1,
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.races.Item.LMNzbqGSRAFQFE2Y]{kobold}.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>:
      You can make a tail slap attack with your tail. This is a secondary
      natural attack that deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage. Furthermore,
      you can augment your tail slap attack with a kobold tail attachment. For
      the purpose of weapon feats, you are considered proficient with all kobold
      tail attachments.</p><h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>At the start of your turn,
      you can spend 5 stamina points to treat your tail slap as a primary
      natural attack until the beginning of your next turn. The tail slap is
      treated as a primary attack even if used along with weapon attacks as part
      of a full attack.</p>
