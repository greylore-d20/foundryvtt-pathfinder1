  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You surround yourself with a positive energy field that damages undead
      opponents. Each time an undead creature damages you with a melee attack,
      that creature takes an amount of positive energy damage equal to half the
      damage it dealt to you. This damage is calculated after applying your
      damage reduction, resistances, and other defenses. Once this spell has
      dealt 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50), it is
      discharged.</p>
