  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This shield's sides are cut into jagged angles and honed to razor
      sharpness. Dwarven skirmishers often wield these shields in pairs,
      savagely hacking opponents to pieces, while some dwarven scoundrels enjoy
      the shields' imposing appearance and ease of use. If you have the
      Two-Weapon Fighting feat and are wielding two dwarven war-shields,
      increase the higher of the two shield bonuses by 1. You lose this benefit
      for 1 round when you make a shield bash with one or both dwarven
      war-shields (unless you have the Improved Shield Bash feat or a similar
      benefit). A hand holding a dwarven warshield can't be used for anything
      else. A dwarven war-shield gains no benefit from shield spikes.</p>
