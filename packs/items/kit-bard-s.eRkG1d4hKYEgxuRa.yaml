            <p>This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom
            and one side to create a bag for sleeping in. Some have cloth straps
            along the open side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are
            sleeping. It can be rolled and tied into a tight coil for storage or
            transport. Most people use a <em>blanket</em> with the bedroll to
            stay warm or provide a ground cushion.</p>
