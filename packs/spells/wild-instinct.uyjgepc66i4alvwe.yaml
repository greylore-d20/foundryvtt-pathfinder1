  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell sharpens your senses, allowing you to perceive threats you
    would otherwise miss. You become aware of sounds and smells you would
    normally overlook, and even retain the ability to detect threats when
    soundly asleep. For the duration of the spell, you gain a +5 bonus on
    Perception checks to act in a surprise round. Additionally, you don't take a
    penalty on Perception checks while sleeping, and can choose to wake if you
    notice a threat while asleep.</p>
