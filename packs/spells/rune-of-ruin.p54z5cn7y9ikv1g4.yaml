  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You curse a magic item, such as magical clothing, a suit of armor, or a
      weapon. The object is reduced to 1/4 its normal hit point total, gains the
      broken condition, and appears damaged and worn. If it grants a numeric
      bonus, such as a +2 deflection bonus to AC, that bonus is reduced by 1 for
      every 3 caster levels you possess, to a minimum of +0. Other magical
      qualities fail to work 50% of the time when called upon, so a resistance
      bonus on saves or a weapon's <i>flaming</i> special ability could fail
      each time the item is used.  If the object is an intelligent magical item,
      its Ego score remains unchanged despite its reduced quality. The weapon
      has only a 50% chance to successfully use any spells or spell-like
      abilities it has, and has a 25% chance of forgetting its special purpose
      (if any). If an intelligent weapon is actively dominating its wielder when
      it fails its save against <i>Rune of Ruin</i>, the wielder gains an
      immediate saving throw with a +4 bonus to regain control. <i>Rune of
      Ruin</i> has no affect on magical artifacts.</p>
