  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>interposing hand</i>, except that it can
      also grapple one opponent you select. The <i>grasping hand</i> gets one
      grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in
      place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus for its Strength (31)
      score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no
      bonus on the Combat Maneuver Defense).</p><p>The hand holds but does not
      harm creatures that it grapples.</p><p>Directing the spell to a new target
      is a move action. The <i>grasping hand</i> can instead be directed to bull
      rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be
      directed to interpose itself, as <i>interposing hand</i> does.</p>
