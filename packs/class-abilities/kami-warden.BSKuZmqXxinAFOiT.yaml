  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Characters can act as bodyguards as well as assassins or spies; some
      mystically emulate the relationship between kami and their wards when
      protecting their charges. A character with this trick gains
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.JSPFo2fBkNlrtVqi]{Bodyguard} and
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.nW2GUYlGhZ2bmgdz]{In Harm’s Way} as bonus
      feats, ignoring their prerequisites. When using In Harm’s Way to intercept
      an attack, the character can spend 1 ki point to gains DR 10/cold iron and
      resistance 10 to acid, electricity, and fire for that attack.</p>
