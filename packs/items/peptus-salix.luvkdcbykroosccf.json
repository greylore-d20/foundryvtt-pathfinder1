      "value": "<p><b>Price</b> 30 gp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>\n<p>This pink liquid has a horrible chalky taste, but is quite effective at counteracting nausea, indigestion, and diarrhea. A vial taken in small doses during the day, alleviates these symptoms. If you drink an entire vial, for 1 hour you get a +2 <em>alchemical bonus</em> on <em>Fortitude</em> saving throws against effects that inflict the <em>nauseated</em> or <em>sickened</em> condition. If you drink a vial of it while suffering from the <em>nauseated</em> or <em>sickened</em> condition, you may immediately roll another saving throw (with the +2 bonus) against the effect; you may gain this particular benefit only once per day. Drinking a vial (whether over the course of a day or all at once) usually turns your tongue black for about a day, though this is a harmless side effect.</p>"
