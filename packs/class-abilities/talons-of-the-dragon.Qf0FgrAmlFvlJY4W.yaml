      <p>You fight with the fearsome talons of dragonkind. You can grow claws as
      a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to
      perform two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base
      attack bonus. Each of these attacks deals an amount of slashing damage
      equal to 1d4 (1d3 if you are Small) + your Strength modifier.</p><p>At 5th
      level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of
      overcoming DR.</p><p>At 7th level, the damage die increases by 1 step, to
      deal an amount of slashing damage equal to 1d6 (1d4 if you are Small) +
      your Strength modifier.</p><p>At 11th level, these claws deal an
      additional 1d6 points of damage of your chosen energy type on a successful
      hit.</p><p>You can use your claws for a number of rounds per day equal to
      3 + your Charisma modifier. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>
