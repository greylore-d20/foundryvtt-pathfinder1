      class="source"><strong>Source</strong> <em>PZO9410</em></p><p>A common
      flask of acid has many uses as an alchemical power component, particularly
      with attack spells.</p><ul><li><em>Acid Arrow</em> (M): The spell's acid
      lasts 1 round longer than normal.</li><li><em>Acid Fog</em> (M): The fog's
      radius and height increase by 5 feet.</li><li><em>Acid Splash</em> (F):
      The spell deals +1 point of damage.</li><li><em>Acid Splash</em> (M): The
      spell lasts 1 round longer than normal.</li><li><em>Dispel Magic</em> (M):
      Using acid as a material component while attempting to dispel or
      <em>counterspell</em> a spell or effect with the earth subtype gives you a
      +2 bonus on your dispel check. This bonus applies whether you are using
      <em>dispel magic</em>, <em>greater dispel magic</em>, or some other spell
      that you can use for counterspelling (for example, if you have the
      <em>Improved Counterspell</em> feat).</li><li><em>Grease</em> (M): The
      grease is acidic and deals 1 point of acid damage per round to any
      creature in the area or holding the greased object.</li><li><em>Wall of
      Ice</em> (M): For each flask of acid used as a power component, you may
      designate one 10-foot square of ice wall that, if <em>broken</em> through,
      deals 1d6 acid damage in addition to the normal cold damage.</li></ul>
