    value: >-
      <p>This two-sided case contains a soft wax that readily takes and keeps an
      impression of an object pressed between the two halves, creating an
      excellent mold of the item. A skilled artisan may then make a copy of the
      item from the mold (and destroying the mold in the process). Making an
      impression surreptitiously requires a DC 25 <em>Sleight of Hand</em>
      check.</p>
