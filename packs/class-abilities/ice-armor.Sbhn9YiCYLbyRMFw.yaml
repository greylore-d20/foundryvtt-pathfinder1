  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can conjure armor of ice that grants you a +4 armor bonus.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by
      +2.</p>

      <p>At 13th level, this armor grants you DR 5/piercing. In cold conditions,
      the armor bonus (and DR bonus) increases by 2; in very hot conditions it
      decreases by 2.</p>

      <p>You can use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This
      duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour
      increments.</p>
