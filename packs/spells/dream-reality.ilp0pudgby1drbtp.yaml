  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause the target to perceive the world as if in a dream. When the
    spell ends, the target forgets all identifying details of events that
    transpired while the spell lasted. The memories were not taken from it;
    rather, its mind never recorded the memories as real in the first place. If
    <i>modify memory</i> is cast upon it before the spell ends, the target
    remembers these events. A target under the effect of <i>lullaby</i> before
    this spell is cast applies its penalty to the saving throw against this
    spell.</p>
