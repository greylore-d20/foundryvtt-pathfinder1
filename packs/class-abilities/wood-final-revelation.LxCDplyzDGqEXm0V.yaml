  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, you become a living creature of wood. You are
      forevermore treated as the plant type rather than your original type for
      the purpose of spells and magical effects. Your skin takes on the
      appearance of polished wood grain, and you gain a +4 natural armor bonus
      to your Armor Class and damage reduction 10/â€” against wooden weapons or
      any natural attacks made by a wooden or woodlike creature. You gain
      immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning. At will,
      you can meld with any tree or single block of wood (as meld into stone,
      except wood only, and with no limit to how long you can remain in the
      wood).</p>
