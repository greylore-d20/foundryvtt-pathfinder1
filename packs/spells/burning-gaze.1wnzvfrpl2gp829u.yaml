    value: >-
      <p>Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes
      alight with a glance.</p><p>As a standard action as long as this spell's
      effects persist, you may direct your <i>burning gaze</i> against a single
      creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures
      must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage.
      Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must
      make a Reflex save or catch fire.</p><p>Each round, burning creatures may
      attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6
      points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save
      or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is
      already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from <i>burning
      gaze</i>.</p><p>Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack-
      foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting
      your gaze.</p>
