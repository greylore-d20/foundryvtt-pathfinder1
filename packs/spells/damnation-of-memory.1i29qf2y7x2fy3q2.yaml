    value: >-
      <p>You name one creature and excise all memory of that creature's
      involvement in events the targets remember. The targets either forget who
      exactly performed the named creature's deeds or assume some other
      individual performed them. Alternatively, you can name either one event
      lasting no more than 10 minutes per caster level or a single topic
      (defined at the GM's discretion) such as a shameful secret of the king
      that was recently revealed or a small revolt that was quelled messily, and
      erase all recollection of that subject from the minds of all creatures
      within the area. Memory of facts and topics that are common knowledge
      (information with a Knowledge check DC of 10 or less) cannot be stolen via
      this spell.</p><p>The lost memories are stored in the focus gem (which
      grows dull inside and cannot be used as a focus or material component for
      any other spell, including another casting of this spell). The targets
      emanate no magic and the spell cannot be dispelled from them; only the
      focus retains a magic aura, and only by targeting the gem can the spell be
      dispelled, disjoined, or suppressed with antimagic. If the gem is
      destroyed or the spell is dispelled (which destroys the gem), all stolen
      memories return to the affected creatures.</p>
