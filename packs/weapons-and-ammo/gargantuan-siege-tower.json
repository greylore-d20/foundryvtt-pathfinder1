The lower story of the tower contains the crew members who propel the tower, and provides total cover to those within. A siege tower with the broken condition moves at half speed. If a siege tower is destroyed, the entire tower collapses. Treat this as a <a style=\"text-decoration:underline\" href=\"Rules.aspx?Name=Cave-Ins%20and%20Collapses%20(CR%208)&amp;Category=Dungeon%20Terrain\">cave-in</a>. </p><p></p><p>The upper section of a siege tower provides improved cover for a number of soldiers (see below) and may have pierced walls allowing creatures to fire ranged weapons out the sides. The roof section may have a battlement and may mount a siege engine of the siege tower's size or smaller and a corvus. Siege towers have a base speed of 15 (or 10 feet if protected with medium or heavy armor).</p><p></p><p> Siege towers have a hardness of 5, and hit points based on their size. A Large siege tower has 60 hit points, a Huge one has 240 hit points, a Gargantuan one has 640 hit points, and a Colossal one has 1,250 hit points. </p><p></p><p><h2>Table 3-17: Siege Tower Complement</h2><table class=\"inner\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Size</strong></td><td><strong>Soldiers</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>200</td></tr></tbody></table></p>"
