You take only half damage from effects and attacks that deal hit point damage.</p><p>The target of this spell takes the remainder of the damage.</p><p>Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level drain, and death effects cannot be shared through this link. If you suffer a reduction in hit points because of a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target of this spell because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned back to you.</p><p>If you and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell immediately ends.</p>",
