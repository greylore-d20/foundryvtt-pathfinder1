    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, a bard can choose one type of <em>Perform</em> skill. He
      can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated
      skills. When substituting in this way, the bard uses his total
      <em>Perform</em> skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its
      associated skillâ€™s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if
      it is a class skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bard
      can select an additional type of <em>Perform</em> to substitute.</p>

      <p>The types of <em>Perform</em> and their associated skills are: Act
      (<em>Bluff</em>, <em>Disguise</em>), Comedy (<em>Bluff</em>,
      <em>Intimidate</em>), Dance (<em>Acrobatics</em>, <em>Fly</em>), Keyboard
      Instruments (<em>Diplomacy</em>, <em>Intimidate</em>), Oratory
      (<em>Diplomacy</em>, <em>Sense Motive</em>), Percussion (<em>Handle
      Animal</em>, <em>Intimidate</em>), Sing (<em>Bluff</em>, <em>Sense
      Motive</em>), String (<em>Bluff</em>, <em>Diplomacy</em>), and Wind
      (<em>Diplomacy</em>, <em>Handle Animal</em>).</p>
