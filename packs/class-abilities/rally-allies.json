      "value": "<p>At 8th level, an order of the eel cavalier inspires diverse groups of allies against their common enemies, bringing them together based on their similarities while downplaying their differences. As a swift action, the cavalier can grant a competence bonus on weapon damage rolls to all allies within 30 feet. The bonus is equal to the number of distinct races in the ally group, including the cavalier’s race, up to a maximum bonus equal to the cavalier’s Charisma modifier (minimum +1). This bonus lasts for 1 round. The cavalier can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>"
