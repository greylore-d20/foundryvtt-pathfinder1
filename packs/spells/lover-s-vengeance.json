If cast on you, the next time you are in combat with that enemy, you gain the benefits of a <i>rage</i> spell. If cast on a lover, he or she gains the benefits of a <i>rage</i> spell the next time the lover is in combat against your enemy. This variant of the spell must be cast within 1 hour of an intimate encounter with the target. The <i>rage</i> effect lasts 1 round per level. If the creature that triggers the <i>rage</i> effect is one of your lovers or ex-lovers, the benefits granted by the <i>rage</i> spell double. This spell counts as a <i>contingency</i> spell on the target for the purpose of multiple contingent effects. Worshipers of Calistria are fond of using this spell, and many keep the effect running whenever possible.</p>",
