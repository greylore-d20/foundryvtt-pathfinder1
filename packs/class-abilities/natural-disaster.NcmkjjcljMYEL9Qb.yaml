  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A witch using this hex calls down the forces of nature to wreak havoc
      on an area. This functions as a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.n4e35m6qu9nmkhgm]{Storm Of Vengeance} combined with
      an @Compendium[pf1.spells.a5gcbpwfhu4hh5ic]{Earthquake} that occurs on the
      second round of the effect (while acid is raining from the sky). A witch
      must concentrate for the duration of this effect. If disrupted, the effect
      immediately ends.</p>

      <p>A witch can only use this ability once per day.</p>
