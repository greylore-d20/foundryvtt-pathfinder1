      choice.</p><p>@Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.x48O0CAEs10yL68R]{Telekinetic

      targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The telekinetic
      fist deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage + 1 for every two wizard
      levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day
      equal to 3 + your Intelligence
      modifier.</p><p>@Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.A3KJJHMNlAjUzcx6]{Change
      Shape (Sp)}: At 8th level, you can change your shape for a number of
      rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive. This ability otherwise functions like beast shape II or
      elemental body I. At 12th level, this ability functions like beast shape
      III or elemental body II.</p>
