    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, an order of the blossom cavalier can make a sneak attack,
      as the rogue ability of the same name. At 2nd level, his sneak attack
      damage is +1d6. This damage increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 6
      levels thereafter. If the cavalier gets a sneak attack bonus from another
      source, the bonus damage stacks.</p>
