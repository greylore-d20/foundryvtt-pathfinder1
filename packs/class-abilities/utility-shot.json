Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; align-items: center;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Blast Lock:</em>&nbsp;The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; cursor: url('ui/cursors/pointer.webp'), pointer;\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC.&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; cursor: url('ui/cursors/pointer.webp'), pointer;\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">Arcane lock</a>&nbsp;grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; cursor: url('ui/cursors/pointer.webp'), pointer;\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; cursor: url('ui/cursors/pointer.webp'), pointer;\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;or the AC increases by 10.

A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11.
