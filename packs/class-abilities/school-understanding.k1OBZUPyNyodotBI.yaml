  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can select one <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/WizardSchools.aspx">arcane school</a> from
      any of the schools available to a character with the arcane school wizard
      class feature, but does not have to select any opposition schools. The
      arcanist gains one ability of that arcane school as though she were a
      1st-level wizard, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence
      modifier for this ability. The ability must be one gained at 1st level and
      is limited in its use per day to 3 + the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier. As
      a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir
      to bolster her understanding, allowing her to treat her arcanist level as
      her wizard level for the purpose of using this ability for a number of
      rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). During this time, she
      also gains use of the other ability gained at 1st level for her selected
      school. She does not gain any other abilities when using this exploit in
      this way, such as those gained at 8th level.<p>If the arcanist already has
      an arcane school (or gains one later), taking this exploit instead allows
      her arcanist levels to stack with the levels of the class that granted the
      arcane school when determining the powers and abilities of her arcane
      school.</p>
