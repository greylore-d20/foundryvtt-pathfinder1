      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Drinking this crystal-clear liquid accelerates the natural process of
      healing Constitution damage. Resting for 1 hour after drinking a vial
      heals you of 1 point of Constitution damage as if you had benefited from a
      full night’s rest. Taking multiple doses in an hour does not increase the
      rate of healing; you must take each individually, followed by an hour of
      rest, for it to have any effect. Using more than 4 doses of padzahr in 1
      day has no effect.</p>
