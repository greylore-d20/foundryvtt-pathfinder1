      "value": "<p>A bard of 12th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to the&nbsp;<em>mass cure serious wounds</em>, using the bard’s level as the&nbsp;<em>caster level</em>. In addition, this performance removes the&nbsp;<em>fatigued</em>,&nbsp;<em>sickened</em>, and&nbsp;<em>shaken</em>&nbsp;condition from all those affected. Using this ability requires 4 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. Soothing performance relies on audible and visual components.</p>"
