By expending two daily uses of his bombs, he can use the dyes to create an image in a space adjacent to him, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.kq916lznxo0ig68v]{Silent Image}, using his alchemist level as the spellâ€™s caster level. The image he creates remains for a number of minutes equal to his alchemist level. He can dismiss this image as a standard action.</p>"
