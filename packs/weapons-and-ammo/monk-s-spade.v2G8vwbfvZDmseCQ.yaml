  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This polearm is a double weapon. One side is fitted with a broad,
      shovel-like sharpened blade, while the opposite side is fitted with a
      crescent blade that juts out like a pair of bull's horns. The monk's spade
      does many types of damage. The type of damage it deals depends on how it
      is wielded, with the spade side able to bludgeon and slash and the
      crescent side able to slash and pierce.</p>
