When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a -4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.<p>Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf1.skills.L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE]{Craft (alchemy)} DC: 25</p>\n<p>Alchemical Power Component</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"http://paizo.com/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8dmf\">Adventurer's Armory pg. 27</a></p>\n<p>While they are effective enough on their own, these stones have useful interactions with some spells.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.nee6cxpoekp3aklq]{Alarm} (M): If cast as a mental alarm, you may have the spell activate a mental and audible alarm. If cast as an audible alarm, the alarm is as loud as a thunderstone and affects creatures in a 10-foot-radius spread as if a thunderstone had detonated there.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.53dyu81yaw4y0nz4]{Glyph of Warding} (M): Creatures that fail their saves against a blast glyph are also deafened as if by a thunderstone.</li>\n</ul>"
