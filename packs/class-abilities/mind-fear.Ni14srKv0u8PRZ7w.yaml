      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cause a
      living creature to succumb to fear. The target must be within 30 feet of
      you, and it can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If the
      target fails the save and has a number of Hit Dice less than or equal to
      yours, it is frightened for 1d4 rounds. If the target fails the saving
      throw and has a number of Hit Dice greater than yours, it is instead
      shaken for 1d4 rounds.</p>

      <p>This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
