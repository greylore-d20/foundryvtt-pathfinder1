    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, three times per day as a swift action, you can imbue your
      melee attacks with a measure of your ancestor’s power. For 1 round, your
      melee attacks deal 1d6 additional points of good-aligned damage if you are
      good, or they deal 1d6 additional points of evil-aligned damage if you are
      evil. If you are neutral, you must choose which type of damage this
      ability deals when you choose this bloodline, and the decision cannot be
      changed later.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, you can use this ability up to five times per day.</p>

      <p>At 20th level, all your melee attacks deal this additional damage, and
      you don’t need to activate this ability.</p>
