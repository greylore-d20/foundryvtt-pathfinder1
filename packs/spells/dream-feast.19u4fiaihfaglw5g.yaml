      <p>The next time the target sleeps (within the next 8 hours), she dreams
      of a rich feast with her favorite foods and drinks. When she awakens, she
      is sated as if she had eaten a nutritious meal, regardless of what she
      dreamed she ate. The target must sleep for at least 1 hour to gain the
      benefits of this spell. Being awakened during this period interrupts the
      spell and cancels its effects.</p><p>If you sleep with this spell
      prepared, you may automatically expend it while you sleep to gain the
      spell's benefit. This expenditure does not count as spellcasting for the
      purpose of determining available spell slots (you could go to sleep at
      midnight, expend this spell during an 8-hour period of sleep, and still
      prepare your full allotment of spells in the morning).</p>
