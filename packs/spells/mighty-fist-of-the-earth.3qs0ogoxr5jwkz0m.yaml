  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a fist-sized rock that flies toward one enemy. Make an
      unarmed strike attack roll against the target as if it were in your
      threatened area. If the attack is successful, the rock deals bludgeoning
      damage to the target as if you had hit the target with your unarmed
      strike. If you have a <i>ki</i> pool, as long as you have at least 1 point
      in your <i>ki</i> pool, the rock counts as a <i>ki</i> strike.  At 4th
      level, a qinggong monk (<i>Ultimate Magic</i> 51) may select this spell as
      a <i>ki</i> power costing 1 <i>ki</i> point to activate (if the monk has 0
      <i>ki</i> points after activating this <i>ki</i> power, the rock does not
      count as a <i>ki</i> strike).</p>
