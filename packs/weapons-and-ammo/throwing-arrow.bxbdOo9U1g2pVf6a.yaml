      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Too long to use in a bow, the throwing arrow has no nock at the tail.
      Instead, it has a notch ahead of the fletching where a throwing arrow cord
      can be attached (see above).</p>

      <p>If thrown without the use of a cord, treat a throwing arrow as a
      dart.</p>
