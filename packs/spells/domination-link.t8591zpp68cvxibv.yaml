  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>detect thoughts</i>, with the additional
    ability to find echoes of the thoughts of a creature mentally controlling
    the target. For example, if the target has been dominated by a vampire, you
    can use evidence left in the target's mind to learn about that vampire. Each
    minute you concentrate on the spell, you can learn your choice of one of the
    following pieces of information. <i>Direction</i>: The controller's general
    direction and distance. <i>Emotion</i>: The controller's emotional state
    (gloating, sated, frightened, angry, and so on). <i>Image</i>: A powerful
    iconic image relevant to the controller or its connection to the target,
    such as a symbol on a door or a name on a gravestone. <i>Location</i>: The
    controller's general location, such as "in a large city" or "on a ship."
    <i>Name</i>: The name by which the target knows its controller (if any). 
    All of this information is based on the last time the influencing creature
    linked itself to the target, either to issue a command or to receive sensory
    input from the target. For example, if at nightfall a vampire commanded a
    dominated victim to walk to a cemetery, this spell can reveal the vampire's
    general location at that time, though it may have moved since then.</p>
