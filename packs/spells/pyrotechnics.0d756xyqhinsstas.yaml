      <p><i>Pyrotechnics</i> turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or
      a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice. The spell uses
      one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that
      it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are
      not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1
      point of damage per caster level.</p><p><i>Fireworks:</i> The fireworks
      are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights.
      This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become
      blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates). These creatures must have line of
      sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent
      blindness.</p><p><i>Smoke Cloud</i>: A stream of smoke billows out from
      the fire, forming a choking cloud that spreads 20 feet in all directions
      and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is
      ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take -4
      penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates). These effects
      last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature
      leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.</p>
