      "value": "<p>A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;school instead.</p>\n<p>A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/evocation\">evocation</a>&nbsp;as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a @Compendium[pf1.spells.6oq1wcryviik9ice]{Fireball}. In addition, a specialist takes a –4 penalty on any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks\" rel=\"nofollow\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;wizard can prepare spells from any school without restriction.</p>\n<p>Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard’s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;school do not receive a school slot.</p>"
