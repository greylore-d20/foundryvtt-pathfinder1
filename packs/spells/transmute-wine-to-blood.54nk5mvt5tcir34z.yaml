    value: >-
      <p>You transform one bottle of fine wine into 1 pint of animal blood,
      sufficient for a creature with the blood drain ability to feed upon as if
      it came from a Medium animal with 1 Hit Die. If you are using the optional
      hunger rules (see page 22), this blood satiates an undead creature's
      hunger, negating any withdrawal effects, but does not grant the creature a
      feeding bonus. The blood coagulates and spoils at the normal rate.</p>
