  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift
      action to balance on the air, hovering in place, until the end of his next
      turn.</p>

      <p>This power does not allow the monk to fly or otherwise move into the
      air; he must jump or use some other ability to reach his position. This
      otherwise functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.e4v1uv8hexeu9sxj]{Air
      Walk}.</p>

      <p>A monk must be 8th level before selecting this power.</p>
