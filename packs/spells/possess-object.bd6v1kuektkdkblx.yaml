  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>magic jar</i>, except you transfer your mind
      to a single object, animating it as if using <i>animate objects</i>,
      except your mind controls the object as if it were your own body. You
      cannot speak or cast spells while possessing the object. Because your
      original body is effectively dead while under the effect of this spell,
      this temporarily suspends disease, poisons, and other afflictions
      affecting you.</p>
