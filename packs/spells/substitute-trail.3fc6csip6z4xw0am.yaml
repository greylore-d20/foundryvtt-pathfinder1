  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell can affect any creatures with which you interacted in the last
    24 hours. You alter the trails left by the chosen creatures, making it
    appear that another creature with which you are familiar left the trail
    instead (you must have met the creature with which you are familiar). If a
    tracker exceeds the DC of the skill check to follow the trail by an amount
    equal to  your caster level, the tracker recognizes that the trail has been
    manipulated by this spell, although it cannot see the trail's true nature
    unless it uses magical means, such as <i>true seeing</i>.</p>
