      "value": "<p>As a move action, you can tear open a small rent in reality just large enough to reach an arm through. The far end of this portal must be within 10 feet of you, but otherwise allows you to manipulate objects, perform melee attacks requiring a single hand, or even cast spells. If you cannot see your target, standard concealment penalties apply. You cannot move either end of the portal once itâ€™s created, and the opening collapses immediately when you leave your current space or withdraw your arm, but it otherwise lasts for 1 round per psychic level. Your disembodied hand uses your AC with a +4 size bonus, should opponents target it. This size bonus does not apply to disarm combat maneuver checks.<br><br>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, the range of your rift reach increases to 20 feet.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, your range increases to 30 feet.</p>"
