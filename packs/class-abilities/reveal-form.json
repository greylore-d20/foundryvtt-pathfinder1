      "value": "<p>At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, you can invoke the name of your deity and order one shapechanged target within 30 feet to reveal its true form. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your inquisitor level + your Wisdom modifier) or be forced on its next turn to dispel any ongoing polymorph effects or innate shapechanging abilities to assume its natural form. If a creature affected by this ability fails its save and is for some reason unable to dispel any ongoing polymorph effects or innate shapechanging abilities, it is instead staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>"
