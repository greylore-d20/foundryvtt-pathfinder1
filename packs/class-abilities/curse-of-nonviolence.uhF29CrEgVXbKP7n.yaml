      <p>The witch can curse a creature to prevent it from attacking innocents.
      If the target fails its Will save, it cannot take violent actions or do
      anything destructive against any creature with fewer Hit Dice than itself.
      If another creature takes hostile action against the cursed creature, the
      cursed creature can act normally in regard to that creature
      only.</p><p>This is an abjuration effect.</p><p>The curse is permanent but
      can be removed with a @Compendium[pf1.spells.myg2b9ww43nnlbr2]{Break

      the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again
      for 1 day.</p>
