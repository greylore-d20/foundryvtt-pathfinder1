      <p>You create a spectrum of multicolored solid light that can be used for
      one of two effects.</p><p><i>Bow</i>: The spell creates a longbow or
      shortbow appropriate for your size, and you are proficient in the use of
      this weapon. When drawn, the bow automatically creates a <i>+1 seeking
      brilliant energy arrow</i>; it cannot fire any other arrows. A creature
      struck by one of these arrows is surrounded by <i>faerie fire</i> and
      dazzled for 1 minute. This version of the spell ends when you have fired a
      number of arrows equal to your caster level.</p><p><i>Bridge</i>: The
      light forms a bridge or ramp 5 feet wide and up to 10 feet long per caster
      level. Creatures on the bridge are dazzled. Allies gain a bonus equal to
      your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) on checks, saves, and to their CMD to
      resist being moved from the bridge against their will.</p><p>Enemies take
      a penalty equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) checks, saves, and to
      their CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will.</p>
