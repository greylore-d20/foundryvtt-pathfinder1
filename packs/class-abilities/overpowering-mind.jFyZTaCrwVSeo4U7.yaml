    value: >-
      <p>The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to increase the
      Will save DC of the linked spell by 1.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, she can choose to instead spend 4 points to increase the
      DC by 2.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, she can choose to instead spend 6 points to increase the
      DC by 3.</p>

      <p>This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the
      mind-affecting descriptor and require a Will saving throw.</p>
