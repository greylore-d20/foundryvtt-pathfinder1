      <p>You frustrate an opponent with ill fortune that leads even its most
      accurate attacks astray. The target is unable to score critical threats
      for the duration of this spell, even if the result of its roll would
      normally be a critical threat. If the creature rolls a natural 20, the
      attack still hits regardless of its opponent's AC, but the hit is not
      eligible for a critical confirmation roll. Once a critical threat has been
      foiled by <i>vexing miscalculation</i>, the spell is discharged.</p>
