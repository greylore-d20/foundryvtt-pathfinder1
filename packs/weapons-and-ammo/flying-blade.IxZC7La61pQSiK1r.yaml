  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A flying blade is a large, crescent-shaped blade anchored to a 10-foot
      chain. You fight with a flying blade by spinning it about your head or by
      snapping it toward an opponent. Because the flying blade is a clumsy
      weapon, you receive a -2 penalty on attack rolls with it, but when you
      make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you receive a +2 bonus
      on attack rolls instead of the penalty.</p>
