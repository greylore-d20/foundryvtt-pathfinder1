  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks,
    granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and
    <i><i>slow</i>ing</i> chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This
    abjuration has four effects.</p><p>First, each warded creature gains a +4
    deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike
    <i>Protection from Chaos</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not
    just against attacks by chaotic creatures.</p><p>Second, a warded creature
    gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic
    creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and
    mental influence, just as <i>Protection from Chaos</i> does.</p><p>Finally,
    if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature,
    the attacker is <i><i>slow</i>ed</i> (Will save negates, as the <i>slow</i>
    spell, but against <i>shield of law</i>'s save DC).</p>
