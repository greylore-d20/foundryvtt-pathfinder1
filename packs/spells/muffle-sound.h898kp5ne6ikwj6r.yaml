  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You suppress sounds made by the targets, granting them a +4 bonus on
    Stealth checks. The targets have a 20% chance of spell failure when casting
    spells with verbal components or using abilities that have audible
    components (such as some bardic performances). This spell does not hamper
    the targets' ability to hear other sounds and provides no protection against
    language-dependent or sonic spells and effects.</p>
