    value: >-
      <p>As a full-round action, a rogue with this talent can set a simple trap
      with a CR no greater than 1/2 her rogue level. To do this, she must
      purchase the components, spend the required time constructing the trap in
      advance, and have its components at hand. The type of trap that can be
      constructed in this way is subject to GM discretion.</p>
