      <p>Psychoactive bombs are mixed with neurotoxic extracts that heighten
      certain sensations. A creature struck by a psychoactive bomb takes a â€“1
      penalty on saving throws against charm, emotion, fear, and pain effects,
      and the DC for Intimidate checks against the victim decreases by 2. This
      effect lasts for 1 hour per alchemist level. These penalties do not stack,
      and a creature can only be affected by a single psychoactive bomb at a
      time. A psychoactive bomb deals 1d6 fewer hit points of damage than
      normal.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
