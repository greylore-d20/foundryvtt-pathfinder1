  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, an order of the Green cavalier can touch a weapon and
      enhance it as a free action once per day. For 1 minute, the weapon glows
      with a deep-green light and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage
      against aberrations and undead. This damage does not stack with the
      additional damage granted by the <em>bane</em> weapon special ability. At
      16th level, the cavalier can use this ability a second time each day.</p>
