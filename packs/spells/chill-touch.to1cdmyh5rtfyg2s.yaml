    <p>A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life
    force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals
    1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength
    damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this
    melee touch attack up to one time per level.</p><p>An undead creature you
    touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will
    saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster
    level.</p>
