    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as per <i>detect magic</i>, except that it detects
      only charm, compulsion, and possession effects. You immediately detect the
      strength and location of each such aura on all creatures in the area. You
      can attempt to identify the properties of each aura (see Spellcraft on
      page 106 the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook). In addition to noticing
      the targets of these effects, you can recognize when creatures in the area
      are using these effects on others by attempting a Sense Motive check as a
      standard action (DC = 20 + caster level). If you succeed, you can attempt
      a Spellcraft check to identify what magic it is using (even if the target
      is not in the area).</p>
