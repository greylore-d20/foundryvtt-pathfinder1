  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent rolls twice when making Climb checks and
      takes the better of the two rolls. If she already rolls twice while making
      a Climb check because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight
      bonus on both of those rolls instead. If the character is under the effect
      of a spell or ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse
      result, she only needs to roll 1d20 while making Climb checks.</p>
