      <p>A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them from
      attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by good creatures, and
      weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration
      has four effects.</p><p>First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection
      bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of
      <i>Protection from Good</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not
      just against attacks by good creatures.</p><p>Second, a warded creature
      gains SR 25 against good spells and spells cast by good
      creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects the subjects from
      possession and mental influence, just as <i>Protection from Good</i>
      does.</p><p>Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against
      a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of Strength
      damage (Fortitude negates).</p>
