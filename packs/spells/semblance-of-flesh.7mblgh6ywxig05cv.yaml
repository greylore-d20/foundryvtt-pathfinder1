  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You make the target construct appear to be a living creature of flesh and
    bone, regardless of its actual materials. You can make it seem 1 foot
    shorter or taller, and appear thin, fat, or anywhere in between. Its bodily
    configuration does not change; for example, a centaur-like construct looks
    like a centaur rather than a human. The extent of the apparent change (such
    as flesh color, hair color, apparent age, and so on) is up to you.  The
    spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor
    does it alter the perceived tactile or audible properties of the construct.
    If you use this spell to create a disguise, the construct gains a +10 bonus
    on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer receives a
    Will save to recognize it as an illusion.</p>
