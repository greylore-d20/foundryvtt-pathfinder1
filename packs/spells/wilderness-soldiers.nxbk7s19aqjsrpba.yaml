    value: >-
      <p>You call on the plants nearby to aid you in combat. This spell is
      ineffective if no plants you can direct are within the area. You can spend
      a swift action and/or a standard action on each of your turns to direct
      one of the following attacks. The attack bonus or CMB for these attacks
      equals your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier. You grant a +1 bonus
      per three caster levels (maximum +5) on damage rolls due to this spell.
      Your <i>wilderness soldiers</i> never provoke attacks of opportunity, and
      they do not count as allies for flanking or other purposes. <br
      /><i>Tree</i>: A tree makes a melee attack with a 10-foot reach from its
      trunk. A hit deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 points + your Wisdom
      modifier. The tree can instead attempt a bull rush, drag, or reposition
      combat maneuver with the same reach, but the tree cannot move itself. <br
      /><i>Undergrowth or Hedgerow</i>: Acting as a Medium creature, one square
      of undergrowth or hedgerow attempts a grapple combat maneuver against an
      opponent within or adjacent to that square. Heavy undergrowth gains a +2
      bonus to its CMD. Undergrowth cannot move the grapple or pin a foe, but it
      can deal an amount of damage equal to 1d4 points + your Wisdom modifier by
      making a successful grapple check against a foe it is grappling. The
      undergrowth's CMD is 5 + its CMB. If you fail to direct the undergrowth to
      maintain the grapple, it releases its opponent.</p>
