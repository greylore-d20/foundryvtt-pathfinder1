Your <em>sorcerer</em> levels stack with any <em>wizard</em> levels you have when determining the powers of your bonded object. This ability does not allow you to have both a <em>familiar</em> and a bonded object. Once per day, your bonded object allows you to cast any one of your spells known and increase the save DC of that spell by 1.</p>"
