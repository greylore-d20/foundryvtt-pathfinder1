  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A boarding pike is an 8-foot-long pole topped with a foot-long tapered
      metal tip. Boarding pikes look much like longspears, but the metal pike is
      designed to flow into the wooden haft, leaving no grooves, collars, or
      spikes that could trap salt water and cause rust. Boarding pikes are
      mainly used defensively, to repel boarding actions. The pikes are kept in
      brackets around the mast, so sailors can quickly grab pikes and brace them
      against the gunwale to repel boarders.</p>
