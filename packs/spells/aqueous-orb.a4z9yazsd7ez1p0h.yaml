  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a rolling sphere of churning water that can engulf those it
    strikes. The <i><i>aqueous</i> orb</i> can move up to 30 feet per round,
    rolling over barriers less than 10 feet tall. It automatically quenches any
    nonmagical fires and functions as <i>dispel magic</i> against magical fires
    as long as those fires are size Large or less.</p><p>Any creature in the
    path of the <i><i>aqueous</i> orb</i> takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.
    A successful Reflex save negates this damage, but a Large or smaller
    creature that fails its save must make a second save or be engulfed by the
    <i><i>aqueous</i> orb</i> and carried along with it. Engulfed creatures are
    immersed in water and must hold their breath unless capable of breathing
    water. They gain cover against attacks from outside the <i><i>aqueous</i>
    orb</i> but are considered entangled by its churning currents, takes 2d6
    points of nonlethal damage at the beginning of their turn each round they
    remain trapped. Creatures within the orb may attempt a new Reflex save each
    round to escape into a random square adjacent to the <i><i>aqueous</i>
    orb</i>. The orb may hold one Large creature, 4 Medium, or 16 Small or
    smaller creatures within it.</p><p>The sphere moves as long as you actively
    direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and
    churns in place. An <i><i>aqueous</i> orb</i> stops if it moves outside the
    spell's range.</p>
