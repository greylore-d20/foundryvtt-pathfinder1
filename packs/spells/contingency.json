The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast <i>contingency</i>.</p><p>The spell to be brought into effect by the <i>contingency</i> must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).</p><p>The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the <i>contingency</i> immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being \"cast\" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur.</p><p>If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (<i>contingency</i> and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.</p><p>You can use only one <i>contingency</i> spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.</p>",
