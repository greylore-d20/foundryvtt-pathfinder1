      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 150 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>\r\n<p>When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates a resistant barrier that protects you from cold damage. You gain cold <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">resistance</a> 5. The gel flakes away as it absorbs cold damage; when it absorbs a total of 20 points of cold damage, it is discharged. Frost ward gel counts as <a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/protection-from-energy\">protection from energy</a> for the purpose of stacking multiple cold protection effects. Applying frost ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. Multiple applications of frost ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose is active merely resets the potential amount of cold damage absorbed to 20 points.</p>\r\n"
