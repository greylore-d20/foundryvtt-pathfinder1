      "value": "<p>As a standard action while in an area of dim light or darkness, a rogue with this talent can coalesce wisps of shadow into a quasi-real, functional item. The rogue must choose whether to make a crowbar, 50 feet of silk rope, a glass cutter, a light melee weapon with which she is proficient, a reversible cloak, thieves’ tools, or a wire saw; the GM may allow other similar items. The rogue can use such items for a number of minutes per day equal to 10 plus her rogue level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.<p>An item created with this ability remains until the rogue is no longer touching it, or until the rogue runs out of duration for this talent, at which time it dissolves. A rogue can select this talent more than once, gaining an additional 10 minutes of duration each time this talent is selected. If a rogue has selected this talent at least twice, she adds 50 feet of silk rope with a grappling hook, a masterwork light melee weapon with which she is proficient, and masterwork thieves’ tools to the list of things she can create.</p>"
