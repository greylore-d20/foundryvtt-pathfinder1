    value: >-
      <p>Your sacred bond with metal gives you insight into its form and
      function. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes meditating on the
      structure of a piece of unworked metal or ore to gain a +5 insight bonus
      on your next Craft check to make something using that metal.</p>
