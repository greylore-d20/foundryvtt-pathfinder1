      <i>You can draw weapons faster than most.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Base attack bonus +1.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You
      can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move
      action.</p><p>A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at
      his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a
      bow).</p><p>Alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands cannot be drawn
      quickly using this feat.</p>

      <p><b>Normal</b></p>

      <p>Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your
      base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement.
      Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.</p>
