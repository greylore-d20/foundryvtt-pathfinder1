      <p>As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his ki pool, as a
      standard action, a monk with this power can make an unarmed strike against
      a foe as a touch attack. He adds 1/2 his monk level as a bonus on the
      damage roll. He can spend 1 ki point to double this bonus for that
      attack.</p>

      <p>A monk must be at least 12th level before selecting this ki power.</p>
