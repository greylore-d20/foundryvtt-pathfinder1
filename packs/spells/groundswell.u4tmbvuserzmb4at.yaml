  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell allows the target to cause the ground to rise up beneath
      him. As a swift action, the target can cause the ground to rise 5 feet,
      while all adjacent squares are treated as steep slopes (<i>Core
      Rulebook</i> 428). The <i>groundswell</i> precludes flanking from
      creatures standing at lower elevations than the target. If the target
      moves after creating a <i>groundswell</i>, the ground returns to its
      normal elevation at the end of his turn; otherwise, it remains in place
      until the target moves or uses a swift action to return the ground to
      normal. A <i>groundswell</i> cannot increase elevation of the ground
      beyond 5 feet.</p>
