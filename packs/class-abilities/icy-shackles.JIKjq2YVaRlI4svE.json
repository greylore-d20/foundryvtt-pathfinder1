The manacles have AC 10, hardness 0, and 30 hit points, and a creature can destroy them with a successful Strength check (DC = 10 + half your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) as a standard action. The icy shackles melt away after 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>"
