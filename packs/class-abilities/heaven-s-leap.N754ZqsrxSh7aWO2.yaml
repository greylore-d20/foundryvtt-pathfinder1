  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman is adept at creating tiny tears in the fabric of space, and
      temporarily stitching them together to reach other locations through a
      limited, one-way wormhole. As a standard action, the shaman can designate
      herself or a single ally that she can see who is within 30 feet of her.
      She can move that creature as if it were subject to
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.99ihqk5u93smyy9x]{Jester's Jaunt}.</p>

      <p>Once targeted by this hex, the ally cannot be the target of this hex
      again for 24 hours.</p>
