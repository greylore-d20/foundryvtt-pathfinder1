These attacks can be any combination of unarmed strikes and attacks with a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>&nbsp;special weapon (he does not need to use two weapons to utilize this ability).</p>\n<p>For the purpose of these attacks, the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;from his monk class levels is equal to his monk level. For all other purposes, such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, the monk uses his normal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when he uses flurry of blows, as if using @Compendium[pf1.feats.3fNdl7eIUJ5d5fwg]{Improved Two-Weapon Fighting} (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).</p>\n<p>At 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using flurry of blows, as if using @Compendium[pf1.feats.ieltigobtFrlTXIt]{Greater Two-Weapon Fighting} (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).</p>\n<p>A monk applies his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;bonus to his damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands.

A monk cannot use any weapon other than an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. A monk with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapons</a>&nbsp;cannot use such weapons as part of a flurry of blows, nor can he make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attacks</a>&nbsp;in addition to his flurry of blows attacks.</p>"
