    value: >-
      <p>You are an immaculate team player and can distribute your team-based
      insights to your allies with a touch. This revelation grants you a bonus
      teamwork feat. You must meet the teamwork featâ€™s prerequisites, if any.
      Additionally, you can touch an ally as a standard action to confer upon it
      the benefits of any one teamwork feat that you have. This effect persists
      for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1).</p>

      <p>You can confer the benefits of a teamwork feat you have a number of
      times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
