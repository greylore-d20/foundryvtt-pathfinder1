      <p>You whisper a single word in the primordial language of good that is
      anathema to the minions of evil and strengthens the resolve of good
      creatures. Evil creatures within the burst must make a Fortitude saving
      throw or become sickened for 1 round/level. Evil outsiders with the evil
      subtype, evil-aligned dragons, and undead in the burst also take 2d8
      points of damage if they fail their saves. Good-aligned creatures in the
      burst gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 round.</p>
