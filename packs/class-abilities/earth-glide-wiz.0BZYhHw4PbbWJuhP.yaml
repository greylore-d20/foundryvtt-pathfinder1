      level, you gain the ability to move through earth, dirt, and stone for a
      number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. You cannot move
      through worked earth or stone; only natural substances can be traversed.
      If your total duration expires before you exit the earth, you are flung
      back to the point where you entered the stone, take 4d6 points of damage,
      and are stunned for 1 round. Your burrowing does not leave a hole, nor
      does it give any sign of your presence (although you can be detected by
      creatures with tremorsense). These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>
