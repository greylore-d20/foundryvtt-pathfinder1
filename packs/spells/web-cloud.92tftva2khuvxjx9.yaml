  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a cloud of flame-resistant strands of adhesive <i>web</i>bing
    that billows and flows much like a <i>cloudkill</i> spell. The cloud moves
    away from you at a rate of 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of
    the ground.  Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new
    point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin
    where the caster cast the spell. Creatures trapped in the <i>web</i>bing
    remain trapped even after the cloud passes, but the area the cloud leaves
    behind does not count as difficult terrain.  Because the <i>web</i>bing is
    heavier than air, it sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring
    down den or sinkhole openings. The cloud of <i>web</i>bing cannot penetrate
    liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.  The cloud otherwise acts like a
    <i>web</i> spell. A creature in the cloud at the start of its turn must save
    against the cloud or be affected. The <i>web</i>bing of this spell is
    flammable (see the <i>web</i> spell), but has fire resistance 5.</p>
