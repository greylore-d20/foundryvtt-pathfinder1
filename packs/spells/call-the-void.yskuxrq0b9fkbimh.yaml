      <p>This spell surrounds you with an aura of nothingness that channels the
      mysterious energies of the Dark Tapestry. Creatures adjacent to you when
      this spell is cast and at the start of your turn take 2d6 points of
      damage. In addition, creatures affected by your aura are fatigued, cannot
      breathe, and cannot speak or cast spells with somatic components.
      Creatures adjacent to you are allowed a Reflex save to halve the damage
      and negate the fatigue effect, but cannot breathe or speak regardless of
      whether their save is successful as long as they are adjacent to you.</p>
