      <p>Your blast sends strange electric signals through the targetâ€™s body,
      scrambling its synapses and causing it to become staggered for 1 round.
      The target is aware it can choose to take a move action to remove the
      staggered condition inflicted by this infusion. This infusion is a
      mind-affecting effect.</p>
