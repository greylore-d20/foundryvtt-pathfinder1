      <p>A common lamp illuminates a small area, providing normal light in a
      15-foot radius and increasing the light level by one step for an
      additional 15 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim
      light becomes normal light). A lamp does not increase the light level in
      normal light or bright light. A lamp burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of
      <em>oil</em>. You can carry a lamp in one hand.</p>
