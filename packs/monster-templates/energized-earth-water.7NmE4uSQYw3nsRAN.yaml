      <p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong> Acquired<br
      /><strong>Simple Template</strong> No<br /><strong>Usable with
      Summons</strong> No</p><p>Most golems are animated by an elemental spirit
      bound within a constructed body, but some creators build their golems with
      a greater purpose in mind. An energized golem is infused with the raw
      elemental energy of the elemental spirit used to animate it, granting it
      increased strength and agility and a host of supernatural
      powers.</p><p>“Energized” is an acquired template that can be added to any
      golem (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An energized golem
      uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as
      noted here. Save DCs are equal to 10 + half the energized golem’s Hit Dice
      + the energized golem’s Constitution modifier.</p><p><strong>Challenge
      Rating:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.</p><p><em>Aura (Su): </em>An
      energized golem radiates one of the elemental energy auras described
      below. All creatures within 5 feet of the energized golem take 1d6 points
      of energy damage at the beginning of the golem’s turn. Each type of
      elemental aura generates an additional effect within this range, as is
      described below. For every 10 Hit Dice the energized golem has, the range
      of the aura extends by 5 feet and it deals an additional 1d6 points of
      energy damage. The type of energy damage and any additional effects of the
      aura are determined by the elemental overcharge special
      quality.</p><p><em>Blizzard:</em> The frigid temperatures surrounding the
      energized golem deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to the
      damage dice of its elemental aura to all creatures within range each
      round. A creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this additional
      nonlethal damage. Creatures that take any amount of nonlethal damage from
      this effect are fatigued. If a target is already fatigued, it is instead
      exhausted. The fatigued or exhaustion condition persists until the
      creature recovers from the nonlethal damage.</p><p><em>Caustic Mist:</em>
      A poisonous miasma emanates from the energized golem, afflicting those
      within range each round with a deadly toxin that rapidly destroys flesh,
      muscle, and organs alike. Poison (Ex): Aura—inhaled; save Fort; frequency
      1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Str, 1 Dex, and 1 Con damage; cure 2
      saves.</p><p><em>Immolation:</em> The extreme heat surrounding the
      energized golem causes each creature and unattended object within range to
      catch fire unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. Each affected creature or
      item takes an additional amount of fire damage equal to the number of
      damage dice for the energized golem’s elemental aura immediately and each
      round thereafter as long as it remains within the aura. A creature or
      object that has caught on fire but moves outside of the aura instead takes
      1d6 points of fire damage each round and can attempt another Reflex save
      each round to extinguish the flames.</p><p><em>Swirling Winds:</em>
      Powerful winds surround the energized golem, buffeting creatures within
      range and dealing an additional amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the
      damage dice of its elemental aura. These winds otherwise function as a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.cnuin981hdq7ryit]{gust of wind} spell. An
      affected creature can attempt a Reflex save to negate this additional
      damage, but a successful Fortitude save is required to negate the <em>gust
      of wind</em> effect. If the energized golem has 10 or more Hit Dice, the
      DC of Fly or Strength checks to resist the effects of the winds increases
      by 5.</p><p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor improves by
      3.</p><p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> An energized golem receives double
      the bonus hit points based on its size granted by the construct creature
      type.</p><p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> An energized golem’s
      body is infused with elemental energy, granting it immunity to a single
      energy type. Refer to the elemental overcharge special quality
      below.</p><p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> An energized golem retains
      all of the base creature’s special abilities and gains the following
      special attack.</p><p><em>Energy Discharge (Su):</em> Once per hour, an
      energized golem can discharge a pulse of energy from its body as a
      standard action, affecting all targets within a 20-foot burst. This burst
      deals 1d8 points of energy damage for every 2 Hit Dice the energized golem
      has (Reflex half ). Each creature damaged by this ability must succeed at
      a second saving throw or suffer an additional effect. The type of energy
      damage, the additional effect, and the type of save to avoid this
      additional effect are determined by the elemental overcharge special
      quality.</p><p><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> An energized golem gains
      ability scores based on the base creature’s Hit Dice and the type of
      elemental spirit used in its creation. If the elemental spirit used is an
      air or fire elemental spirit, the energized golem gains a +2 bonus to
      Strength and +4 bonus to Dexterity. If the elemental spirit used is an
      earth or water elemental spirit, the energized golem gains a +4 bonus to
      Strength and +2 bonus to Dexterity. If the base creature has 10 or more
      Hit Dice, these ability score bonuses increase to +8 and
      +4.</p><p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> An energized golem retains
      all of the base creature’s special qualities and gains the following
      special quality.</p><p><em>Elemental Overcharge (Su):</em> An energized
      golem is augmented by the elemental spirit that is bound to it during its
      creation. Its natural attacks deal 1d6 points of energy damage for every 6
      Hit Dice the golem has. The type of damage dealt, the golem’s immunity,
      and its aura are based on the elemental spirit bound to the golem during
      its creation, as listed on the table below.<br /><br
