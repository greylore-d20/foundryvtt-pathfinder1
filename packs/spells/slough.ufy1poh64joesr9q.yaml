  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round as its
      skin loosens and splits. Once it has taken 5 or more points of
      Constitution damage in this way, its skin falls off to reveal its
      musculature. The creature ceases taking Constitution damage, but takes a
      -4 penalty on saving throws against disease, pain effects, or poison, and
      on Charisma-based skill checks with the exception of Intimidate and Use
      Magic Device. The creature's skin regrows rapidly-once its Constitution
      damage is fully healed, its skin becomes intact once again and the
      penalties end.</p>
