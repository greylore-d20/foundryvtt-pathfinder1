      "value": "<p>A bard of 8th level or higher can use his performance to foster a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to take become&nbsp;<em>shaken</em>. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bardâ€™s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the bard continues the performance. The performance cannot cause a creature to become&nbsp;<em>frightened</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>panicked</em>, even if the targets are already&nbsp;<em>shaken</em>&nbsp;from another effect. Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting&nbsp;<em>fear</em>&nbsp;effect, and it relies on audible and visual&nbsp;<em>components</em>.</p>"
