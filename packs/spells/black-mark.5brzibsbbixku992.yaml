  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You mark the target with a <i>black mark</i>ing on its skin; the mark's
    exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The
    <i>black mark</i> functions as a <i>mark of justice</i>, and when the mark
    is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water
    more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the <i>black mark</i>
    is active, the target is affected as if subject to nature's exile (Advanced
    Player's Guide 233), but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or
    with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type,
    though non-aquatic animals are not.</p>
