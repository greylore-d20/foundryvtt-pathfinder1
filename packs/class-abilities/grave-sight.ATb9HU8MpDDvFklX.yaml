    value: >-
      <p>The shaman sees the states of life, death, undeath, and general health
      of those around her. When using this ability, she can tell whether or not
      creatures within 30 feet that she can see are living, wounded, dying, or
      dead, as well as determine if any are undead. Lastly, she can tell if
      those creatures are poisoned or diseased.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her
      shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
