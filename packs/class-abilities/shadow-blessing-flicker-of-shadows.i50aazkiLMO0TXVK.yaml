  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can cause a weapon you touch to warp and become
      insubstantial for a split second before an attack. The first attack made
      with this weapon each round ignores any shield bonus to Armor Class, as
      well as bonuses from cover. Total cover still provides a creature its full
      benefit.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>
