  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A gandasa is a wide, single-edged dagger on a 2-foot handle and is
      wielded in combat like an axe. This weapon is also known as an elephant
      knife because the connection between the blade and the handle is often
      decorated to resemble a stylized elephant head.</p>
