      "value": "<p>At 9th level, you can surround yourself with a mobile, 10-foot-radius emanation of mutable reality. This rippling distortion is similar to @Compendium[pf1.spells.g0q8c0ni0rvipjpn]{Solid Fog}&nbsp;but does not provide&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment\">concealment</a>&nbsp;or block line of sight. Your movement is not slowed by this aura. Attacks from outside the aura suffer a 20% miss chance against targets inside the aura. You may use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level, though this duration need not be continuous.</p>"
