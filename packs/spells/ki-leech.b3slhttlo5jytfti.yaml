  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a
      critical hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer
      hit points, you can steal some of that creature's <i>ki</i>. This
      replenishes 1 point of <i>ki</i> as long as you have at least 1 <i>ki</i>
      point in your <i>ki</i> pool. This does not allow you to exceed your
      <i>ki</i> pool's maximum. This ability does not stack with similar
      abilities (such as the steal <i>ki</i> ability of the hungry ghost monk in
      the Advanced Player's Guide).</p><p>This spell has no effect if you do not
      have a <i>ki</i> pool.</p>
