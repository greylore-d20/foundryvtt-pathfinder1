      <p>The witch curses the target so he is doomed to die (Will negates). As
      long as the curse persists, the target takes a â€“4 penalty to his Armor
      Class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill
      checks.</p><p>While the curse persists, the witch may end it by bringing
      its full force upon her victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a
      penalty equal to the witch's caster level to his Armor Class or on any
      single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check,
      or saving throw. The witch must decide to apply this penalty before the
      roll to be modified is made. If the witch does not have line of sight to
      the target, the full force of the curse occurs when the GM considers it
      most appropriate, such as when the target is in mortal danger.</p><p>A
      target can only have one dire prophecy upon him at a time.</p><p>Whether
      or not the target's save against the hex is successful, a creature cannot
      be the target of this hex for 1 day.</p><p>This is a curse effect.</p>
