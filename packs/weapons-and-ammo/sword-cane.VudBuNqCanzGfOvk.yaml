      <b>Critical</b> x2; <b>Range</b> -; <b>Type</b> P</p><p><b>Weapon
      Groups</b> Blades, Light</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This slender light
      blade lies within a wooden container that serves as both its scabbard and
      hiding place. You can draw the blade as a swift action (or a free action
      if you have the Quick Draw feat). An observer must succeed at a DC 20
      Perception check to realize an undrawn sword cane is a weapon rather than
      a walking stick; the DC decreases to 10 if the observer is able to handle
      the weapon. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity
      modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a sword
      cane sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a
      sword cane in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength
      modifier to damage.</p>
