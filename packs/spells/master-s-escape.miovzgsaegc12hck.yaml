  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create an extradimensional link between yourself and one summoned
    creature you control that allows you to switch places. After casting
    master's escape, you can teleport to your summoned creature's space as a
    swift action, causing your summoned creature to teleport to your former
    space. If your summoned creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points before
    you can use this spell's effect, you can teleport to a space that you can
    see within 30 feet as an immediate action. After using either of these
    effects, the spell ends. A summoner can target his eidolon with this
    spell.</p>
