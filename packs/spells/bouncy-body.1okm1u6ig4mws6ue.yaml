  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target's flesh becomes flexible and rubbery. It gains a +2
    circumstance bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist
    checks, as well as to its CMD against combat maneuver checks to grapple.
    Anytime the target would take falling damage, it treats falls as 20 feet
    shorter (minimum 0) for the purpose of determining damage. In addition, if
    the target falls against a hard surface, it can attempt an Acrobatics check
    (DC = the distance fallen) to attempt to bounce upward; success means the
    creature bounces upward half the distance fallen.</p>
