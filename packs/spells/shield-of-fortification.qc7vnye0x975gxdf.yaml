  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a magical barrier that protects a target's vital areas. When
    the target is struck by a critical hit or a sneak attack, there is a 25%
    chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is
    instead rolled normally.</p><p>This benefit does not stack with other
    effects that can turn critical hits or sneak attacks into normal attacks,
    such as the <i>fortification</i> armor special ability.</p>
