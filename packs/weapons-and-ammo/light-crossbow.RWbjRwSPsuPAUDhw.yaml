      P</p><p><b>Weapon Groups</b> Crossbows</p><h3>Description</h3><p>You draw
      a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a
      move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A light crossbow fires
      crossbow bolts.</p><p>Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two
      hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one
      hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with
      each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two
      light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed
      firing.</p>
