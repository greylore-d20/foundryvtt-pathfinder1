  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The madu is a round, light leather shield with two animal horns-usually
      from an antelope-extending from opposite sides. If you are proficient with
      the madu, you may use it to fight defensively with a -2 penalty instead of
      the normal -4, and your attack penalty for using Combat Expertise improves
      by +1 (minimum -1 penalty). You cannot hold anything else in the hand that
      bears a madu. If you are not proficient with the it, treat it as a light
      spiked shield. A madu can't be disarmed. It can be crafted entirely out of
      metal, but both versions offer the same basic protection and attack
      benefits, though they respond differently to some spells and effects. A
      druid can use a leather madu, but not a steel madu.</p>
