  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The magic of your allies in the area becomes more potent against
      certain outsiders. Choose one alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or
      lawful). Against outsiders with that alignment component or subtype, your
      allies in the area gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome
      spell resistance, and their spells ignore the first 10 points of energy
      resistance (but not energy immunity).  This spell gains the alignment
      descriptor that is opposite the outsider alignment chosen. For example, if
      you choose for the spell to affect evil outsiders, then this spell has the
      good descriptor.</p>
