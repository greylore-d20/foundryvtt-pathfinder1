  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can call down a number of bolts of lightning per day
      equal to your cleric level. You can call down as many bolts as you want
      with a single standard action, but no creature can be the target of more
      than one bolt and no two targets can be more than 30 feet apart. This
      ability otherwise functions as call lightning.</p>
