      "value": "<p>There are some cavaliers who dedicate themselves to the land and the people who inhabit the rural areas between urban centers. These cavaliers often lead untrained militias of revolutionaries in backwoods towns, fighting against oppressive governments or the savage elements that threaten citizens in their daily lives. Self-reliance and the ability to make do with sparse resources are hallmarks of a cavalier who follows the order of the land.<br><br><strong>Edicts:</strong> The cavalier must always strive to protect the common folk from the depredations of oppressive regimes. He must not decline any duty or mission because he is not properly equipped for it.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the land cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on ranged attack rolls against the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the land cavalier adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Survival (Wis) to his list of class skills. In addition, whenever an order of the land cavalier makes a Survival check to avoid getting lost, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>"
