  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This single-use javelin bears a thunderstone just behind the head. If
      you successfully strike a target with one of these javelins, the creature
      takes damage as normal and is the center of the thunderstone's effect. If
      you miss, roll to see where the javelin lands (as if determining a miss
      with a splash weapon); that square becomes the center of the
      thunderstone's effect.</p>
