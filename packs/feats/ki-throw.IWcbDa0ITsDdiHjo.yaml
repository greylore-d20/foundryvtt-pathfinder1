    value: >-
      <p>Your physical control and mastery of momentum allows you to throw
      enemies.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Improved Trip, Improved Unarmed
      Strike.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: On a successful unarmed trip attack against
      a target your size or smaller, you may throw the target prone in any
      square you threaten rather than its own square. This movement does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity, and you cannot throw the creature into a
      space occupied by other creatures.</p><p><b>Special</b>: A monk may gain
      Ki Throw as a bonus feat at 10th level. A monk with this feat can affect
      creatures larger than his own size by spending 1 ki point per size
      category difference.</p><h2>Combat Trick</h2><p>You can spend 5 stamina
      points to throw a creature one size category larger than you.</p>
