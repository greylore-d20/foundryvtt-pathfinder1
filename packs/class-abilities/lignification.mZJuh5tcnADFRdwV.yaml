    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, you can turn a creature into wood. As a standard action,
      you may direct your gaze against a single creature within 30 feet. The
      targeted creature (along with all its carried gear) must make a Fortitude
      save or turn into a mindless, inert statue made out of wood for a number
      of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level. This ability otherwise functions
      as a @Compendium[pf1.spells.361rc74674l3zt9a]{Flesh to Stone} spell,
      except the target turns to wood instead of stone. This can be reverse by
      any effect that can reverse flesh to stone.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
