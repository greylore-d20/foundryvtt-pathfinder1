      <p>Not all beings who stalk the night hunt mortal prey. Out of honor,
      desperation, or tragic need, a vampire hunter pits his abilities not just
      against the creatures of the night, but also their terrifying undead
      overlords: vampires. Most vampire hunters do not survive their first
      encounters with vampirekind, as no amount of study or training can truly
      prepare one to face the Nobles of the night. Those few who survive and
      force themselves to carry on grow more and more like their terrible
      quarry, becoming dark-garbed bringers of death, feared by the dead and the
      living alike. Vampire hunters approach their duties with a grim but
      ironclad resolve so strong it resembles ecclesiastical faith, and it is
      from this mysterious, selfless dedication that their divine power
      wells.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Vampire hunters obsessively stalk their quarry— not just
      vampirekind, but all those supernatural beasts and undead terrors that
      serve the Nobility. These champions of the living track their blasphemous
      prey, learn their weaknesses, and bring them low. Doing so requires more
      than training and guile, though. To stand against the darkness, vampire
      hunters adopt a measure of their foes’ unnatural power, turning
      vampirekind’s sinister might back against them. Vampire hunters are the
      vanguard in the battle against evil, but know to value the perspective,
      support, and magic of other expert adventurers.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: Any.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175 gp).</p>
