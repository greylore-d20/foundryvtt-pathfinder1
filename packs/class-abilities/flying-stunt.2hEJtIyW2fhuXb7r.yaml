    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can attempt a Fly check against a target’s CMD
      as a swift action when charging from above that target. Success allows the
      character to add an amount damage equal to her Dexterity modifier to the
      attack’s damage. This additional damage is precision damage and is not
      multiplied on a critical hit. A creature immune to sneak attacks is immune
      to this additional damage. A character must be trained in Fly to select this
      talent.</p>
