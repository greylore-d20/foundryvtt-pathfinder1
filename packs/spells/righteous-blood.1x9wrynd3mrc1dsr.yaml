  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target creature's innate goodness infuses its body with holy energy.
    While this energy does not directly empower the target, it can harm
    embodiments of evil. Any creature that damages the target with a slashing or
    piercing melee weapon is sprayed by the target's holy blood. If the attacker
    is a creature with the evil subtype, it takes 1d6 points of damage from
    divine power each time it successfully hits the target. If the target has
    the good subtype or an ability that grants it an aura of good (like paladins
    or some clerics), its blood instead deals 2d6 points of damage. Creatures
    that don't have the evil subtype or that are using reach weapons are not
    subject to this damage.</p>
