    value: >-
      <i>You are skilled at fighting while
      unarmed.</i><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You are considered to be armed
      even when unarmed â€” you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you
      attack foes while unarmed. Your unarmed strikes can deal lethal or
      nonlethal damage, at your choice.</p><p><strong>Normal</strong>: Without
      this feat, you are considered unarmed when attacking with an unarmed
      strike, and you can deal only nonlethal damage with such an attack.</p>
