  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An immobile curtain of illumination springs into existence. When
      created, one side of the wall (designated by you) radiates bright light to
      a range of 60 feet away from that side while the other side radiates
      darkness to an equal distance. This effect alters the illumination level
      by up to two steps toward either bright light (the light side) or darkness
      (the dark side). The wall also obstructs vision through it, regardless of
      which side of the wall the viewer is on.</p>
