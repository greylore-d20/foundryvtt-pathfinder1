  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can communicate with any creature that is not mindless. As long as
      you can be heard, your speech is understandable to all creatures, each of
      which hears you as though you were conversing in its language or other
      natural mode of communication, and you hear their responses as though in
      your own native language. You may ask questions and receive answers,
      though this spell does not make creatures more friendly or cooperative
      than normal, and non-sentient creatures may give limited responses. While
      using <i>truespeak</i>, your language-dependent effects can affect any
      creature that is not mindless.</p>
