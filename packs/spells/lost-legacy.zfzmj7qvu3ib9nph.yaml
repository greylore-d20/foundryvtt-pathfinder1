  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You inflict a powerful curse on a touched creature that causes others
      to quickly forget positive aspects of their interactions with the target.
      The target cannot attempt a Diplomacy (or wild empathy or similar ability)
      check to improve the attitude of other creatures. Any creature that
      normally has an attitude of friendly or helpful toward the target must
      succeed at a Will save at the spell's normal saving throw DC each time it
      interacts with the target, or its attitude becomes indifferent. Once this
      curse is removed, creatures coming back into contact with the target
      regain their pleasant memories of it. If their attitudes toward the target
      have not been reduced from indifferent, their original attitudes are
      restored.</p>
