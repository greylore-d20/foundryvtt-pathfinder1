  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist can throw bombs that splash in a 40-foot line rather than
      affecting a radius. The line starts at the alchemist and extends away from
      him in the direction he chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in
      the squares affected by the line to be the target of the bomb and makes
      his attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the line take
      splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and
      throws an explosive strafe bomb, the line of splash damage is 80 feet long
      instead of 40 feet.</p>
