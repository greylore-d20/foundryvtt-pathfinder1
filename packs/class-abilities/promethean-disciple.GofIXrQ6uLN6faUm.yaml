    value: >-
      <p>An alchemist with this discovery learns how to craft constructs by way
      of alchemical research rather than arcane magic. The alchemist gains <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Craft%20Construct">Craft
      Construct</a> as a bonus feat without needing to meet its requirements.
      The alchemist substitutes his number of ranks in Craft (alchemy) for his
      total caster level and must use Craft (alchemy) to create the construct.
      <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Magic%20Item%20Creation&amp;Category=Magic%20Items">The
      DC to create the construct still increases for any necessary spells that
      the alchemist does not have access to</a>. However, the alchemist can use
      extracts in place of spells as spell prerequisites.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
