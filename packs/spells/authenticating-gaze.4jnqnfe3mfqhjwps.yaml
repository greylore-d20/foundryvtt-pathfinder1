  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your understanding of the written word becomes analytical and
      discerning. You gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum
      +10) on Appraise checks to determine the value of books and scrolls and on
      Linguistics checks to detect forgeries, and you can attempt a Linguistics
      check to detect a forged document at a glance, rather than taking the
      normal 1 round of examination per page. In addition, you immediately
      detect whether written works within 30 feet and within your line of sight
      have a magical aura and the strength of any such auras, as though you had
      concentrated on each written work for 1 round using <i>detect
      magic</i>.</p>
