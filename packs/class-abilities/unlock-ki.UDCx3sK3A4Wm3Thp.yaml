    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this advanced talent increases the number of points in the
      ki pool that she gains from the ki pool rogue talent to be equal to 1/2
      her rogue level + her highest mental ability score modifier (Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma). In addition, she can spend 2 points from her ki pool
      as a swift action to gain the skill unlocks (Pathfinder Unchained 82) for
      one skill of her choice as appropriate for her number of ranks in that
      skill. This benefit lasts for 1 minute. The rogue must have a ki pool
      before selecting this advanced talent.</p>
