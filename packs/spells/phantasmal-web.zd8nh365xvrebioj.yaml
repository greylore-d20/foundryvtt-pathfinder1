      <p>You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that they are
      engulfed in tangled <i>web</i>s teeming with swarms of tiny spiders. Those
      who fail to disbelieve the <i>phantasmal web</i> are treated as if in a
      <i>web</i> spell, but must also make a Fortitude save at the beginning of
      each turn or become nauseated for that round by the phantasmal
      spiders.</p><p>As the <i>phantasmal web</i> exists only in the minds of
      the targets, it cannot be burned or destroyed, and it provides no cover
      (though it does provide concealment) against attacks made by the targets.
      Targets cannot escape the <i>phantasmal web</i> by moving, even by
      teleportation. Freedom of movement allows unobstructed movement but does
      not negate the concealment or nausea effects.</p><p>Targets of the spell
      perceive everyone else around them to be engulfed in <i>web</i>s and
      swarming spiders, but the spell has no visible effect to other creatures
      (who may assist allies to disbelieve the effect).</p>
