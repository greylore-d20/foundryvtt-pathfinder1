  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This flexible saw consists of an abrasive wire hooked to two metal
      rings. By feeding the wire around a deadbolt or small door bar, you can
      use the rings to quietly saw through the obstruction. The saw takes 10
      minutes to cut through a 2-inch piece of wood or a 1-inch iron bar. A wire
      saw can cut through items with hardness 10 or less. After five uses, the
      abrasive wire is worn smooth and must be replaced (costing 25 gp).</p>
