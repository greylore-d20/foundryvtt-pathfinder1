    value: >-
      <p>The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for
      every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The
      warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the
      specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a
      creature from spells for which spell resistance doesn't apply. <i>Spell
      immunity</i> protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items,
      and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against
      supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze
      attacks.</p><p>Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a
      certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar
      in effect. A creature can have only one <i>spell immunity</i> or greater
      <i>spell immunity</i> spell in effect on it at a time.</p>
