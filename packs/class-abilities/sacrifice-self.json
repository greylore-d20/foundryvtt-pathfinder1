      "value": "<p>A rogue who makes a successful Reflex save against an area effect can ignore the benefits of her evasion ability to shield an adjacent ally against the effect, essentially halving the damage that ally would normally take. A rogue with improved evasion can attempt a secondary save against her ally’s damage. If the save is successful, neither she nor her ally takes any damage. A rogue must have evasion in order to select this talent, and she must have improved evasion to benefit from the secondary effect.</p>"
