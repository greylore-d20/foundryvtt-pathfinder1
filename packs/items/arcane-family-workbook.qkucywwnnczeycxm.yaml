      <p><b>Arcane Family Workbook</b> The elven predilection for becoming
      <em>wizards</em> and the social benefits that elven <em>wizards</em> enjoy
      often encourages families to dedicate themselves to wizardly studies for
      multiple generations. Older <em>elven</em> <em>wizards</em> take note of
      their own insights into the secrets of arcane magic and compile these
      thoughts with the ideas of earlier generations to form family workbooks.
      When used as a reference (an action that typically takes 1d4 full rounds
      of searching the text), an arcane family workbook grants a +2
      <em>circumstance bonus</em> on a <em>Spellcraft</em> checks. This bonus
      increases to +4 if 1d4 hours are spent referencing the book. <b>Price</b>
