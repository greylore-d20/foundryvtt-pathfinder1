  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon-an ingenious tool with a
      hammer head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other.
      The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of
      damage (critical multiplier x3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals
      1d4 points of damage (critical multiplier x4). You can use either head as
      the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons.</p>
