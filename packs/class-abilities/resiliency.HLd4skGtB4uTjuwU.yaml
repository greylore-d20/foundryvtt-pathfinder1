  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, a character with this ability can gain a number of
      temporary hit points equal to the character's level. Activating this
      ability is an immediate action that can only be performed when she is
      brought to below 0 hit points. This ability can be used to prevent her
      from dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If the
      character's hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit
      points, she falls unconscious and is dying as normal.</p>
