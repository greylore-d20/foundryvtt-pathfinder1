      <p>You drain the might of the target and transfer that power to another
      creature. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6 + 1 per 2
      caster levels (maximum 1d6 + 5). This effect can't cause the subject's
      Strength score to drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save halves this
      penalty. This penalty doesn't stack with itself or the penalty applied
      from <i>Ray of Enfeeblement</i>.  You can grant any one creature adjacent
      to you (including yourself) an enhancement bonus to Strength equal to the
      Strength penalty imposed by this spell.</p>
