  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian takes no damage from attacks by swarms of
      vermin, preventing harmful secondary effects of such attacks like poison
      or bleed. She also gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD
      when grappling for every four barbarian levels she has (maximum +5).</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the hive totem rage power and be at least 6th
      level before selecting this rage power.</p>
