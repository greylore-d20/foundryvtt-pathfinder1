    value: >-
      <p>The following character talent is available to drow rogues. Particularly
      deft rogues can strike two foes with one well-placed shot. As a standard
      action, a character with this talent can fire a hand crossbow at an enemy who
      is granted cover by another opponent. Make one ranged attack roll and
      compare the result to each opponentâ€™s AC. Each hit deals 1 point of
      damage. Any special weapon properties or precision damage apply to only a
      single target, but any poison applied to the bolt affects all targets
      struck. An unchained character can select this talent.</p>
