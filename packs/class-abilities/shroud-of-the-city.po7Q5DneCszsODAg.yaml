      <p>You can melt into the streets and alleys. You can cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.fxwycv6d7xwzua4t]{Veil} once per day, but can
      affect only yourself and one willing ally per oracle level within 30 feet.
      You can make the targets appear only as typical members of a settlement
      with which you are familiar, and canâ€™t match the appearance of specific
      creatures.</p>

      <p>At 7th level and 15th level, you can use this ability one additional
      time per day.</p>
