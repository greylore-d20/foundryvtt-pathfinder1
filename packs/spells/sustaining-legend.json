You amplify the mythic power of the target creatures, bolstering them with healing energy each time they draw upon their mythic abilities. When a creature affected by this spell expends uses of mythic power for any ability, it immediately heals 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). In addition, the creature benefits from one of the following additional effects.</p><p><ul><li> Remove any one of the following conditions: dazzled, fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered.</p><p><li> Reduce the dazed or stunned condition to staggered.</p><p><li> Reduce the exhausted condition to fatigued.</p><p><li> Reduce the frightened condition to shaken, or the panicked condition to frightened.</p><p><li> Reduce the nauseated condition to sickened.</ul></p><p>A target can benefit from the effects of <i>sustaining legend</i> only once per round, even if the target expends multiple uses of mythic power during that time.</p>",
