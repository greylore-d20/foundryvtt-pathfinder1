      <p>A creature with this ability can poison those it attacks. The effects
      of the poison, including its save, frequency, and cure, are included in
      the creature's description. The saving throw to resist a poison is usually
      a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 poisoning creature’s racial HD + that
      creature’s Constitution modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s
      descriptive text). Poisons can be removed through neutralize poison and
      similar effects.</p><p><em>Format:</em> <strong>Poison Name (Ex)</strong>
