      <i>Maintaining a grapple is second nature to you.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Improved Grapple, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +6, Dex
      13.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to grapple a foe. This bonus
      stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Grapple. Once you have grappled
      a creature, maintaining the grapple is a move action. This feat allows you
      to make two grapple checks each round (to move, harm, or pin your
      opponent), but you are not required to make two checks. You only need to
      succeed at one of these checks to maintain the grapple.</p>

      <p><b>Normal</b></p>

      <p>Maintaining a grapple is a standard action.</p>
