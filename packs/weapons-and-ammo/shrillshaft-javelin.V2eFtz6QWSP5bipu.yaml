  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This single-use javelin bears a thunderstone in its haft, just behind
      the weapon's head. If you hit with one of these javelins, the target takes
      javelin damage as normal and is the center of the thunderstone's effect.
      If you miss, roll to see where the javelin lands (as if determining a miss
      with a splash weapon); that square becomes the center of the
      thunderstone's effect.</p>
