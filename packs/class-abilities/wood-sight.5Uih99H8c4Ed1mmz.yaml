  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a move action, you can alter your vision to see through underbrush
      and plant growth that would normally grant concealment, up to a range of
      60 feet (though darkness and other obstacles still may block your
      sight).</p>

      <p>At 7th level, you can use this ability to see through wood or other
      plant material as easily as if it were transparent glass, penetrating a
      number of feet of wood equal to your oracle level.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your
      oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
