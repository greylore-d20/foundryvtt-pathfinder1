      <p>The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather
      information about the target through divination magic (such as <i>detect
      evil, locate creature, scry,</i> and <i>see invisible</i>). This spell
      also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all
      mindaffecting spells and effects. <i>Mind blank</i> even foils limited
      <i>wish</i>, miracle, and <i>wish</i> spells when they are used in such a
      way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that
      scans an area the creature is in, such as <i>arcane eye,</i> the spell
      works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are
      targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.</p>
