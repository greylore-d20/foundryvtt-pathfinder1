  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The cestus is a glove of leather or thick cloth that covers the wielder
      from mid-finger to mid-forearm. The close combat weapon is reinforced with
      metal plates over the fingers and often lined with wicked spikes along the
      backs of the hands and wrists. While wearing a cestus, you are considered
      armed and your unarmed attacks deal lethal damage. If you are proficient
      with a cestus, you can have your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning or
      piercing damage. Monks are proficient with the cestus. When using a
      cestus, your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry
      items in that hand, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles
      gives you a -2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving that hand
      (such as opening locks). A cestus can't be disarmed.</p>
