      "value": "<p>As a <em>standard action</em>, you can share your vital energy with a living creature that you touch. You take 1d6 points of <em>nonlethal damage</em> + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You cannot take an amount of <em>nonlethal damage</em> equal to or greater than your current hit point total; any excess is prevented. The recipient gains a number of <em>temporary hit points</em> equal to the amount of damage you received (prevented damage is not counted). These <em>temporary hit points</em> disappear 1 hour later. You may not use this ability to grant yourself <em>temporary hit points</em>. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. This ability has no effect if you are immune to <em>nonlethal damage</em>.</p>"
