    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can open her eye of the Arclord one additional time each
      day by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. She can gain more
      uses, but each subsequent use costs 1 additional point from her reservoir
      (2 points for the second additional use, 3 points for the third use, and
      so on). The arcanist must have the <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Eye%20of%20the%20Arclord">Eye
      of the Arclord</a> feat to select this exploit.</p>
