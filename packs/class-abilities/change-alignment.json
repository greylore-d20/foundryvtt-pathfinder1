      "value": "<p>Once per day as part of his preparation of infusions, the alchemist can brew an infusion that shifts the imbiber’s alignment to good. This change in alignment lasts for 10 minutes per alchemist level. An unwilling creature receives a Will save to resist this change. The alchemist may have only one such infusion at any one time. The effects of this infusion may have serious repercussions for a creature suddenly struggling with a new outlook. Many see it as little more than forced insanity, and some good faiths outlaw its use.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 12th level and have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>"
