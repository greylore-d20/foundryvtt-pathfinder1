      <p>At 15th level, you can project your consciousness as if using
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.fmuea6pmgrylbux7]{Arcane Eye}. In addition, at any
      point you can cause the @Compendium[pf1.spells.fmuea6pmgrylbux7]{Arcane
      Eye} to become visible. The eye can no longer be moved, but it acts as a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.0khn0u6nd4fat6wb]{Symbol of Sleep} to all who see
      it. You may use this power once per day.</p>
