  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A handful of pellets, along with 1 dose of black powder, is commonly
      used as ammunition for one-handed and twohanded firearms with the scatter
      weapon quality, though rocks or other small bits of hard material can be
      used in the pellets' place. Using anything other than pellets or
      alchemical cartridges when firing off a cone attack with a scatter weapon
      increases the weapon's misfire range by 1 (though this increase can be
      removed by switching back to standard ammunition). Thirty handfuls of
      pellets weigh half a pound.</p>
