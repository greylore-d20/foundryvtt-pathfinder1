    value: >-
      <p>You affect the local <i>gravity</i> field in a 30-foot-radius sphere
      around the spell's designated point of origin. Creatures in the affected
      area can be weighed down by high <i>gravity</i>, lightened by low
      <i>gravity</i>, or left to float in an area with no <i>gravity</i>,
      depending on the effect you choose for your <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>.
      See page 18 for rules on the effects of high, low, and no
      <i>gravity</i>.</p><p>Creatures that fall within the area of a
      <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> spell take more damage from the fall if the
      <i>gravity</i> within is higher and less damage if the <i>gravity</i>
      within is lower. However, if the creature falls through a
      <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> and continues to fall in a non-affected area,
      the rest of the fall damage is calculated normally. For instance, if a
      creature falls through 20 feet of a low<i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> and an
      additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage
      for the 20 feet of low <i>gravity</i> plus 3d6 points of damage as normal
      for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of
      damage).</p><p>This spell doesn't counteract or negate the effects of
      other spells that affect <i>gravity</i>; both effects occur
      simultaneously. For instance, a no-<i>gravity</i> <i><i>gravity</i>
      sphere</i> spell cast within the area of a <i>reverse <i>gravity</i></i>
      spell would simply mean that creatures float about until the
      <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>'s duration expires or they exit the
      <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>, at which point they return to the top of the
      <i>reverse <i>gravity</i></i> effect's area. If both
      <i>gravity</i>-altering magical effects could not feasibly take place
      simultaneously (at the GM's discretion), the <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>
      spell supersedes the previous effect (if it's higherlevel than the
      previous effect) or simply fails (if it's lower-level).</p>
