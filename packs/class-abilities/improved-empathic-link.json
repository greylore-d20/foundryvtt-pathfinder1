This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companionâ€™s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p>"
