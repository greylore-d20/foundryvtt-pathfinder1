      <p>This 100-page book contains face drawings of male and female dwarves,
      elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, halflings, and humans. By selecting
      an appropriate drawing and adding hair, beard, or other small features
      such as moles or scars, even a poor artist can quickly create a reasonable
      likeness of a specific person- for example, an inquisitor making wanted
      posters of a half-elven witch.</p>
