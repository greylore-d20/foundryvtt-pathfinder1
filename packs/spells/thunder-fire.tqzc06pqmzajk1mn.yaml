      <p>The firearm targeted creates a thunderous report, even if the firearm
      is not loaded. Every creature within 15 feet of the creature wielding or
      carrying the firearm must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1
      minute. The creature wielding or carrying the firearm takes a -4 penalty
      on this saving throw, and his misfire range increases by 1 for 1d4 rounds.
      If the firearm was loaded when it was targeted by this spell, that
      ammunition is wasted.</p>
