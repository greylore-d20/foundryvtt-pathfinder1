  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you
      with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of
      damage + 1 point per caster level. Half of this damage is fire damage and
      half is holy damage (as the spell <i>flame</i> strike). An undead creature
      or a creature particularly vulnerable to light that hits you instead takes
      2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level. Creatures with reach
      weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield
      provides illumination equivalent to a <i>daylight</i> spell. You can have
      only one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack
      with similar damaging aura spells such as <i>fire shield</i> or <i>shield
      of the</i> <i><b>Dawnflower</b></i> (The <i>Inner Sea World Guide</i>
      296).</p>
