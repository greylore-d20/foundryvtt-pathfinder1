      <p>You grant the touched target the ability to ascertain the weaknesses of
      foes. The target deals an additional 1d6 points of precision damage on
      successful attacks with daggers or slings against foes within 30 feet, as
      long as the attacked foe is denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class or
      is flanked by the target. This additional damage increases by 1d6 for
      every 4 caster levels you have beyond 3rd, to a maximum of 5d6 at 19th
      level. This bonus damage is precision damage and stacks with other sources
      of precision damage, such as sneak attack. This bonus damage is not
      multiplied on a critical hit.  Once per round on a successful attack that
      deals this precision damage, the target can choose to forgo 2d6 points of
      precision damage (either granted by this spell or from other sources of
      precision damage, such as sneak attack) to inflict one of the following
      conditions on the attacked foe for 1 round: </p><ul><li> The attacked foe
      can't make attacks of opportunity against creatures smaller than it.
      </li><li> The attacked foe is denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class
      against attacks made with daggers or slings. </li><li> The attacked foe
      takes a -2 penalty on attacks against creatures smaller than it. </li><li>
      The attacked foe can't take 5-foot steps.  A creature can benefit from
      only one <i>halfling vengeance</i> spell at a time.</li></ul><p></p>
