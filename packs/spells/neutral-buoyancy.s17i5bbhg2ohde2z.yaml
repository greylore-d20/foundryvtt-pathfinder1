    value: >-
      <p>The target's buoyancy becomes and stays neutral, regardless of how
      dense the target and its gear are. Among other effects, the target neither
      sinks nor rises when it doesn't attempt a Swim check, making it easier to
      stay put while performing demanding actions or when helpless or disabled,
      and the target can swim up and down with equal ease.</p>
