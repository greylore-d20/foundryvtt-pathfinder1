      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>One of the most infamous devices to evolve as a result of trench
      warfare, the flamethrower is still in its infancy in the early twentieth
      century. The British military produced the Lawrence 1917, which found its
      way into the hands of Russia's soldiers. The device consists of a
      cumbersome backpack of two tanks and a swivelmounted, handheld projection
      unit, or "lance." When the device is aimed and a small hand lever
      depressed, a small gas burner ignites the oil, which is propelled forth in
      a blazing stream of intense flame. A flamethrower with full tanks is
      capable of unleashing up to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating
      effect.</p>

      <p>When using a flamethrower, the wielder projects a 60-foot-long line of
      fire, attempting a separate attack roll against each creature within the
      line. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be
      modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital Strike}. Effects that grant
      concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the <em>blur</em>,
      <em>invisibility</em>, or <em>mirror image</em> spells, do not foil this
      line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical hit, the wielder
      confirms the critical for that roll alone.</p>

      <p>All affected creatures take 4d6 points of damage, and any creature hit
      by the flaming stream must also succeed at succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save
      or catch fire, taking an additional 2d6 points of damage each round until
      the flames are extinguished. A burning creature can attempt a new save as
      a full-round action, and dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +2
      bonus on this save.</p>

      <p>The device's tanks and backpacks are awkward, and the wielder takes a
      -4 armor check penalty when wearing the cumbersome device. In addition,
      the tanks have hardness 10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured
      in the presence of any adjacent flame (including the device's own gas
      igniter), a mighty conflagration erupts, the wielder takes 6d6 points of
      fire damage, and all creatures within a 20-foot radius take 3d6 points of
      fire damage (Reflex DC 20 for half ). Any creatures who take damage must
      succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or catch on fire.</p>
