  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Standard M1914 grenades can be fitted with an optional fragmentation
      sleeve. This sleeve converts the normal concussive blasts into a cloud of
      deadly shrapnel at the expense of a decreased damage radius.</p>

      <p>The device is armed and detonated in the same manner as a regular M1914
      grenade, though the explosion radius is reduced to a 15-foot radius and
      the grenade instead deals 4d6 bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
      (Reflex DC 15 for half ).</p>
