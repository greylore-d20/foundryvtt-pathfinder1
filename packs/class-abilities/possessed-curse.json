You take a –2 penalty on all concentration checks, and concentrating to maintain a spell duration provokes attacks of opportunity. Whenever a foe attempts to use an effect to possess or dominate you and the effect allows a saving throw to negate, you may roll twice and take the better of the two results.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, if you become dazed or stunned, you can choose instead to become confused for twice the duration the daze or stun effect would have normally lasted.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.4mw83czf7b62rar3]{Possession} to your list of 5th-level oracle spells known.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.mdzc265u8qe0p41h]{Object Possession, Greater} to your list of 7th-level oracle spells known.</p>"
