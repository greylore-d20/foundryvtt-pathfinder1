      <p>In seeking to restore formal training in magic to the world, Old-Mage
      Jatembe also discovered a few methods of creating magic effects that did
      not follow consistent or logical rules. While his only known remaining
      notes on these more chaotic forms of magic are closely guarded within the
      Magaambya, some arcanists have either recreated his theories from vague
      comments on other topics or independently rediscovered the methods Jatembe
      first detailed. This “primal magic” can be accessed one of two ways.<p>The
      arcanist can expend 1 or more points from her arcane reservoir to create
      an uncontrolled primal effect. This creates an effect from the Sample
      Primal Magic Events table (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic
      13). The CR of this effect is equal to the arcanist’s caster level, to a
      maximum caster level of 5 per point spent from her arcane reserve. In this
      case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to half
      its CR (maximum spell level 9).<p>Alternatively, the arcanist can expend 1
      point from her arcane reservoir and expend a spell slot of at least 3rd
      level to create an effect as if she has used a <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod
      of wonder</a>. Any spell created by the <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod
      of wonder</a> effect uses the arcanist’s spell level, rather than the
      spell level set by the <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod
      of wonder</a> table (for example a <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a>
      created by an 8th level arcanist rolling on the <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod
      of wonder</a> table would deal 8d6, rather than the listed 6d6). In this
      case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to the
      spell slot expended.</p>
