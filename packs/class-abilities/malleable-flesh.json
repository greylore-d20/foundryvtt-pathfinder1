      "value": "<p>Whether through mutation or alchemy, some vigilantes have flesh that is as moldable as clay and as fluid as ink. A vigilante with this talent gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterSubtypes.aspx?ItemName=Shapechanger\">shapechanger</a>&nbsp;subtype and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Compression\">compression</a>&nbsp;universal monster rule. In addition, the vigilante can alter his appearance as @Compendium[pf1.spells.oj36nfak6jc2s5ky]{Disguise Self}, except that the changes are physical rather than illusory. However, aspects of the vigilante’s aesthetic persist in all forms, halving the bonus on Disguise checks gained from this effect and from seamless guise.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, the vigilante can pass through narrow openings, even mere cracks, along with any item he wears or carries (to a maximum of his light load).</p>"
