    value: >-
      <p>A ninja with this trick can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting
      them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1
      additional point of damage each round for each die of the ninjaâ€™s sneak
      attack. Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the
      start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal
      check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed
      damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses
      any DR the creature might possess.</p>
