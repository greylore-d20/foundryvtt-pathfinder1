The spell alerts you when a creature with traitorous intent is within 200 feet, although it doesn't identify the source. By concentrating, you can learn the strength of the greatest threat, based on the following categories.  <i>Ill Will</i>: Someone dislikes your liege, but isn't planning to act against her.  <i>Plotting</i>: Someone is actively conspiring against your liege.  <i>Imminent</i>: Someone is in the process of carrying out a plot against your liege.  Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting or thought-detecting effects cannot have their intent detected by <i>perceive betrayal</i>.</p>",
