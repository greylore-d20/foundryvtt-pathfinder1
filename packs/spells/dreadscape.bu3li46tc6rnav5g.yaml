  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your targets see their surroundings as a nightmarish reflection of the
      world around them. Buildings and furnishings take on a dirty, ruined
      appearance. Even allies appear foreign and hostile, with friendly speech
      turning into garbled mockery and threats.  Each target gains the scared
      condition and has a hostile attitude toward any new creature it encounters
      (though not toward creatures that were already present at the time of the
      casting). Being hostile doesn't necessarily mean the target will attack,
      and creatures can attempt Diplomacy checks to gain a target's trust at the
      normal DC. If a creature becomes frightened or panicked while under the
      influence of <i>dreadscape</i>, that creature takes 1d6 points of Wisdom
      damage, though only once per casting of <i>dreadscape</i>.  If your
      campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), creatures that become
      frightened or panicked take 2d6 sanity damage instead of Wisdom
      damage.</p>
