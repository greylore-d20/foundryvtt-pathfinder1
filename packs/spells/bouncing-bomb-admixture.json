This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (a formula with \"bomb admixture\" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active.  When you throw your next bomb, choose one target that would normally be hit by the bomb's splash damage. The target is affected as if it suffered a direct hit from the bomb instead.</p>",
