    value: >-
      <p>A dragon that fails its saving throw cannot use its breath weapon for
      the duration of the spell and is treated as one age category younger for
      determining which special abilities it can use. For example, an ancient
      green dragon would revert to the special abilities of a very old dragon
      and lose access to its miasma ability and its <i>dominate person</i>
      spell-like ability. This spell has no effect on a dragon's armor class,
      feats, frightful presence, hit points, physical attacks, saving throws,
      senses, size, skills, spellcasting, or statistics.</p>
