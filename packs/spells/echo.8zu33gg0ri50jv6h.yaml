    value: >-
      <p>You cause a sound heard in the target area up to 1 round ago and
      lasting up to 1 round in duration to repeat at a regular interval. The
      original sound need not have come from the area, but it echoes from the
      target area at its original full volume. Any special effects of the sound
      are not duplicated by this spell. If the area is naturally prone to
      echoes, such as a space surrounded on at least two sides by cliffs or high
      river banks, the spell's range is long. Otherwise, the spell's range is
      close.</p><p>You can concentrate as a standard action to alter the echo.
      You can change it to be any sound audible in the area within the last 1
      round, move the apparent source of the sound within the area, or attempt a
      Bluff check to create a distraction to hide with a bonus equal to your
      caster level.</p>
