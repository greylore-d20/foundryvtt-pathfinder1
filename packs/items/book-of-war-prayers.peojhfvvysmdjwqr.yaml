    value: >-
      <p>This small, leather-bound collection of war prayers features pages of
      fine vellum.</p><p>If you have a <em>Charisma</em> of 13 or higher, or at
      least 1 rank in <em>Perform</em> (oratory), you can read aloud prayers
      from the book before battle to hearten others for the trials to come.
      Reading prayers for this effect takes 10 minutes. You grant those who hear
      your prayers a +2 <em>morale bonus</em> on the next saving throw against
      fear they attempt, as long as that saving throw is made in the next 24
      hours.</p>
