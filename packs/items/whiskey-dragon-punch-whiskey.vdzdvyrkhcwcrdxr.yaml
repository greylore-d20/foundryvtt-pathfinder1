      <h4>Whiskey, Dragon Punch Whiskey</h4>

      <p class="source"><b>Source</b> <em>PPC:Halflings</em></p>

      <p>According to legend, the inventor of this dark and harsh liquor
      actually did attack a dragon bare handed (and presumably lived to pass on
      the recipe). Halflings who drink four cups of Dragon Punch Whiskey in the
      space of an hour take a -4 penalty to <em>Dexterity</em> but gain a +4
      <em>alchemical bonus</em> on saves against fear for the next 10
      minutes</p>

      <p>The listed prices are for a tavern or restaurant in an average
      city.</p>

      <p><b>Note</b>: Non-<em>halflings</em> do not receive any bonuses from
      this drink.</p>
