  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian can attack with abandon at the expense of her defense.
      She gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, but takes a –1 penalty to AC.</p>

      <p>This bonus and penalty increase by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels
      thereafter.</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>

      <p>Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A barbarian can’t have
      more than one stance rage power active at a time. If she activates a
      stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance
      immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning
      of the barbarian’s turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the
      rage ends.</p>
