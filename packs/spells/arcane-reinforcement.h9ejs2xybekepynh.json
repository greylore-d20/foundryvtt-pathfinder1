As part of concentrating on the spell, you must continue chanting the verbal components, pausing at most for a few seconds at a time to speak, chew, and so on. If the crafting takes more than 1 day to complete, you must cast the spell each day to gain its benefit.</p><p>This spell originated among wizards of the Arcanamirium, though the Pathfinder Society also uses it.</p>"
