  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You summon hundreds of Diminutive spiders, which cling together in the
      form of a whip made for a creature of your size. You can wield this object
      as if it were an actual whip, except you make a melee touch attack with it
      instead of a regular attack. Any creature you strike with the whip takes
      swarm damage as if it were attacked by a spider swarm (1d6 points of
      damage plus poison and distraction, <i>Bestiary</i> 258). The swarm whip
      is able to damage creatures with armor or natural armor, even if a normal
      whip could not. It cannot be used to make bull rush, grapple, or trip
      attacks, and (unlike a swarm) is subject to a miss chance for concealment
      and cover.</p><p>The whip is immune to all weapon damage, is never
      staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage, and is immune to any
      spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including
      single-target spells such as disintegrate). The whip takes half again as
      much damage from spells or effects that affect an area, but since it is
      considered part of your gear, it takes damage only if you fail a saving
      throw on a 1 or if it is specifically targeted by an opponent. The whip
      does not have a swarm's susceptibility to high winds.</p><p>As a standard
      action, you can transform the whip into a spider swarm (all squares of the
      swarm must be within 15 feet of you); thereafter it functions as <i>summon
      swarm</i>. The spider swarm has 3 hit points and persists in that form for
      2 rounds or until the end of this spell's duration, whichever comes
      first.</p>
