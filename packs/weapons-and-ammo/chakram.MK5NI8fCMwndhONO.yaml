      <p>The chakram is a simple, elegant, and highly portable thrown weapon. It
      is a flat, open-centered metal discus with a sharpened edge. You can wield
      the chakram as a melee weapon, but it is not designed for such use; you
      take a -1 penalty on your attack roll with the weapon and must succeed at
      a DC 15 Reflex save or cut yourself on the blade (half damage, no Strength
      modifier). You do not need to make this save if wearing heavy armor.</p>
