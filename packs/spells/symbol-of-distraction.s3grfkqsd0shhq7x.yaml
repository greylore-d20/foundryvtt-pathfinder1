      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except that all creatures within the radius of a <em>Symbol of
      Distraction</em> instead become fascinated by the symbol for 10 minutes
      per caster level. Unlike <em>symbol of death</em>, <em>Symbol of
      Distraction</em> has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <em>Symbol of
      Distraction</em> simply remains active for a duration of 10 minutes x your
      caster level. All fascinated creatures move toward the <em>Symbol of
      Distraction</em>, trying to remain within the symbol's area of effect. If
      the symbol leads affected creatures into a dangerous area, each fascinated
      creature can attempt an additional Will saving throw, with success
      indicating it is no longer fascinated. If a creature's view of the symbol
      is completely blocked, it is immediately freed of the symbol's effect.</p>
