    value: >-
      <p>When this spell is cast upon a trap, it improves one specific element
      of the trap chosen at the time of casting. The caster can improve the trap
      in any of the following ways (each one raises the trap's CR by +1).
      </p><ul><li> Increase DC of the Perception check required to locate the
      trap by +5. </li><li> Increase DC of the Disable Device check required to
      disarm trap by +5. </li><li> Increase the trap's attack bonus or saving
      throw by +2.  To cast this on a trap, you must know that the trap exists
      and its precise location. A trap can only have one improvement from this
      spell at a time. A second casting changes the improvement on the trap, but
      does not add another improvement.</li></ul><p></p>
