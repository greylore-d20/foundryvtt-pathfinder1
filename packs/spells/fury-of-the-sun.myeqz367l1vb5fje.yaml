    value: >-
      <p>You curse the target to suffer unbearable heat. On a failed saving
      throw, the target is immediately subjected to severe heat (<i>Core
      Rulebook</i> 444), takes 1d4 points of nonlethal damage, and is suffering
      from heatstroke (fatigued). The target must save every 10 minutes as
      normal for severe heat (starting at DC 15 rather than the DC of this
      spell). Because this heat is internal, the target cannot avoid it using
      the normal methods for escaping heat dangers such as Survival checks or
      finding shade.</p>
