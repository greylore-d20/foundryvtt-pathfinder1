    "shortDescription": "<p>You conjure a supernaturally vicious and clever crow to watch over you on the battlefield. Choose one of the following templates; the crow has that template and this spell gains the descriptor listed in parentheses: celestial (good), entropicB2 (chaotic), fiendish (evil), or resoluteB2 (lawful). In addition to its normal abilities, the crow gains the Improved StealAPG feat  as a bonus feat and gains an eye rake attack. If both of its claw attacks hit the same living foe in a single round, that foe must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be blinded as the bird scratches and tears at the foe's eyes. The blindness lasts for 1d4 days or until healed with <i>remove blindness</i>.  If the focus leaves your possession, the crow vanishes and the spell ends.</p>"
