  description:
    value: >-
      <p>If the barbarian is wielding a pair of daggers, kukris, or punching
      daggers, she can attack once with each of the two weapons when she
      charges. If she does, she loses the bonus on attack rolls for charging and
      takes an additional –2 penalty to her AC, and she applies precision damage
      or effects that occur on a hit only once, even if she hits with both
      attacks.</p>
