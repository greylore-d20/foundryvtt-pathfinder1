  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You grow flesh on a decomposed or skeletonized corpse of a Medium or
      smaller creature, providing it with sufficient flesh that it can be
      animated as a zombie rather than a skeleton. The corpse looks as it did
      when the creature died. The new flesh is somewhat rotted and not fit for
      eating.</p>
