  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The monk combines a writhing twist with a violent strike against a foe
      that is grappling him. If the monk’s attack is successful, he can attempt
      a grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a free action to
      escape a grapple, adding the strike’s damage as a bonus on his check.</p>
