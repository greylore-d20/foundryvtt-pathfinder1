    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions like <i>fog cloud</i>, but in addition to obscuring sight, the <i>solid fog</i> is so thick that it impedes movement.</p><p>Creatures moving through a <i>solid fog</i> move at half their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into <i>solid fog</i> is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in <i>solid fog</i>. <i>Solid fog</i>, and effects that work like <i>solid fog</i>, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.</p><p>Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.</p><p><i>Solid fog</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>solid fog</i> dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>"
