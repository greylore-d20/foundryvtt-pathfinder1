    value: >-
      <p>This trademark spell of the Lantern Bearers functions as
      <i>daylight</i>, except it lasts longer. In addition, as a swift action
      once during the spell's duration, you can will the light to try to end a
      magical darkness effect located within 60 feet of the light this spell
      emits. Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level), with a DC equal
      to 11 + the caster level of the darkness effect. If you succeed, the
      darkness effect ends. Regardless of whether you are successful, the light
      from this spell dims to the brightness of a torch for the spell's
      remaining duration.</p>
