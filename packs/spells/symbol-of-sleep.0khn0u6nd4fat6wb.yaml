      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the
      <em>symbol of sleep</em> instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 x
      10 minutes. Unlike with the <em>sleep</em> spell, <em>sleep</em>ing
      creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time
      expires.</p><p>Unlike <em>symbol of death</em>, <em>symbol of sleep</em>
      has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <em>symbol of sleep</em> simply
      remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><em>Note:</em> Magic
      traps such as <em>symbol of sleep</em> are hard to detect and disable. A
      rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <em>symbol of
      sleep</em> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 +
      spell level, or 30 for <em>symbol of sleep</em>.</p>
