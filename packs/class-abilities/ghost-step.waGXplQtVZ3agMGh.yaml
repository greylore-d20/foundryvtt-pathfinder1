  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, a character with this trick can pass through walls
      as if she were a ghost. Until the end of her turn, she can pass through a
      wall or other surface that is up to 5 feet thick per level as if she were
      incorporeal. She must exit the solid material by the end of her turn. Each
      use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p>
