    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, when using channel energy to heal living creatures, you
      can take a swift action on that same turn to also deal damage to undead
      creatures (as your channel energy ability). Undead take an amount of
      damage equal to half the amount healed, and can attempt the normal saving
      throw to halve this damage.</p>
