  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th,
      and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants
      her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the
      list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at
      a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted
      by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted,
      activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
