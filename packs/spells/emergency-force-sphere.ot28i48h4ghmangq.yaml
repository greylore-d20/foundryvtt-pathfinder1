      <p>As @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.fb38vn4hm4rur6gm]{Wall of Force},
      except you create a hemispherical dome of force with hardness 20 and a
      number of hit points equal to 10 per caster level. The bottom edge of the
      dome forms a relatively watertight space if you are standing on a
      reasonably flat surface. The dome shape means that falling debris (such as
      rocks from a collapsing ceiling) tend to tumble to the side and pile up
      around the base of the dome. If you make a DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry),
      Knowledge (engineering), or Profession (architect or engineer) check, the
      debris is stable enough that it retains its dome-like configuration when
      the spell ends, otherwise it collapses.</p><p>Normally this spell is used
      to buy time for dealing with avalanches, floods, and rockslides, though it
      is also handy in dealing with ambushes.</p>
