    value: >-
      <p>You immediately become aware of any <i>teleport</i>ation effects that
      begin or end within the spell's area. The spell's area radiates from you
      and moves as you move. You know the exact origin point of any
      <i>teleport</i>ation effect that originates within the spell's area, and
      the exact end point of any <i>teleport</i>ation effect that terminates
      within the spell's area. Further, you can detect the lingering traces of
      any <i>teleport</i>ation effect that occurred up to 1 hour previously, in
      the same fashion. You intuitively know, to the nearest minute, when the
      <i>teleport</i>ation effect occurred.  Whenever you detect the origin
      point or termination point of any <i>teleport</i>ation effect with this
      spell, you can study that origin point or termination point for 1 round.
      If you do, you can attempt a caster level check (DC = 11 + the
      <i>teleport</i>ation effect's caster level), taking a -5 penalty if the
      effect occurred more than 1 minute ago. If you succeed, you gain a glimpse
      of the <i>teleport</i>ation effect's termination point (if you detected an
      origin point) or origin point (if you detected a termination point). This
      glimpse lasts long enough for you to get a brief look at the area, but not
      long enough to scrutinize it in detail. It doesn't come with any
      geographic knowledge of the location, so it is not sufficient for
      <i>teleport</i> or similar magic. You can't retry the caster level check,
      even if you cast trace <i>teleport</i> again.</p>
