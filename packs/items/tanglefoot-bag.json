      "value": "<p class=\"source\"><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>PZO1110</em></p>\n<p>A tanglefoot bag is a small sack filled with tar, resin, and other sticky substances. When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged&nbsp;<em>touch attack</em>&nbsp;with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An&nbsp;<em>entangled</em>&nbsp;creature takes a -2 penalty on&nbsp;<em>attack rolls</em>&nbsp;and a -4 penalty to&nbsp;<em>Dexterity</em>&nbsp;and must make a DC 15&nbsp;<em>Reflex</em>&nbsp;save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15&nbsp;<em>Reflex</em>&nbsp;save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.</p>\n<p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17&nbsp;<em>Strength</em>&nbsp;check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an&nbsp;<em>attack roll</em>; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the&nbsp;<em>entangled</em>&nbsp;creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make&nbsp;<em>concentration</em>&nbsp;check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of&nbsp;<em>universal solvent</em>&nbsp;to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</p>\n<p class=\"header\">Alchemical Power Component</p>\n<p class=\"source\"><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>PZO9410</em></p>\n<p>Tanglefoot bags can make troublesome spells even worse when used as a power component.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Black Tentacles</em>&nbsp;(M): For each tanglefoot bag used as a power component, you may reroll the tentacles'&nbsp;<em>grapple</em>&nbsp;check against one creature of your choice.</li>\n<li><em>Slow</em>&nbsp;(M): For each tangelefoot bag used as a power component, you may designate one slowed creature as being affected by a tanglefoot bag.</li>\n<li><em>Web</em>&nbsp;(M): Increase the DC of breaking free by making a&nbsp;<em>combat maneuver</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Escape Artist</em>&nbsp;check by 1.</li>\n</ul>"
