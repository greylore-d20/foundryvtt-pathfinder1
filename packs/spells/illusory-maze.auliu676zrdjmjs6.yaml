      <p>This spell creates the illusion of a translucent, ever-changing maze of
      glass in the target area. Creatures in the area who believe the maze to be
      real cannot move more than 5 feet continuously in any one direction and
      can't move diagonally, forcing them to take a circuitous route to their
      destination.</p>
