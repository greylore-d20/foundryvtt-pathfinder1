    value: >-
      <p>The target exudes a strong odor that most predators recognize as the
      scent of helpless prey. The closest 1d4+1 predatory creatures within 30
      feet must succeed at a Will save or start attacking the target (animals
      with the scent ability are affected if within 60 feet). If the predator is
      an animal, it can be called away from the target by a handler using the
      "down" trick (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 97) or any effect that suspends or
      dispels emotion or rage effects.</p><p>This spell has no effect on
      constructs, undead, or creatures with the unnatural aura ability or
      effects that repel animals.</p>
