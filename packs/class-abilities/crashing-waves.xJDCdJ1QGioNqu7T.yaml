  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The force of a waves shamanâ€™s water spells can bring even the mightiest
      of foes to the ground. When the shaman casts a spell with the water
      descriptor, she does so at 1 caster level higher. If that spell deals
      damage, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be knocked
      prone.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the shaman casts water spells at 2 caster levels
      higher.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, her ability to knock creatures prone extends to any
      spell that deals damage.</p>
