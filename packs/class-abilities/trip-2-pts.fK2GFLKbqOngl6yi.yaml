  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon becomes adept at knocking foes to the ground with its bite,
      granting it a trip attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful bite
      attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check.
      If successful, the target is knocked prone. If the check fails, the
      eidolon is not tripped in return. This ability only works on creatures of
      a size equal to or smaller than the eidolon.</p>

      <p>The eidolon must possess the bite evolution to select this
      evolution.</p>
