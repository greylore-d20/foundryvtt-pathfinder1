    value: >-
      <p>While the barbarian is raging, her animal companion also gains the
      benefits of rage (including greater rage, mighty rage, and tireless rage),
      though the barbarian must spend 1 additional round of rage per round if
      her companion begins or ends its turn adjacent to her, and 2 additional
      rounds of rage per round if not.</p>
