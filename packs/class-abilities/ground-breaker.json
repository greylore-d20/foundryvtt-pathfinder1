If the barbarian manages to deal more damage than the floorâ€™s hardness, the space she occupies and all of the squares adjacent to her become difficult terrain. Creatures in these squares, except the barbarian, must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be knocked prone.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>"
