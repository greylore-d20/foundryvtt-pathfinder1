      <p>This spell functions as <i>entangle</i>, except the plants are coated
      with an irritating sap that creates a painful, itching rash on creatures
      that touch them. Any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there
      must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in
      the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. This is a poison effect.</p>
