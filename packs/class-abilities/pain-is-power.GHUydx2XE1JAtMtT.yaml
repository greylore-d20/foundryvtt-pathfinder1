    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, after taking damage from any source, you may attempt a DC
      25 concentration check as an immediate action. If you succeed, you gain
      the benefits of a blessing of fervorAPG spell for a number of rounds equal
      to 1/2 your cleric level. If you fail, this ability is expended with no
      effect. You can use this ability once at 8th level, plus an additional
      time for every 4 levels you are beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Scythe of Evil power of the Evil Domain or the
      Staff of Order power of the Law Domain.</p>
