  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 17th level, an inquisitor learns to focus her judgment. Whenever an
      inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she must select one type of
      judgment. She is treated as if she were 5 levels higher for the purposes
      of determining the bonus granted by the judgment. Unlike other types of
      judgment, the one enhanced by this ability cannot be changed for the
      remainder of the judgment.</p>
