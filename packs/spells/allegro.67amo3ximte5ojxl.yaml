      <p>This spell allows you to act more swiftly while maintaining a bardic
      performance. You must already be maintaining a bardic performance before
      you can cast <i>allegro</i>. You gain the benefits of the spell
      <i>haste</i> for as long as you maintain that bardic performance. If you
      cease maintaining the bardic performance or it is interrupted, this
      spell's duration ends. As an immediate action while you are maintaining a
      bardic performance, you can dismiss <i>allegro</i> to reroll a Reflex save
      or Dexterity-based skill check-you must choose to reroll before the result
      of the original roll is known. You must take the result of the reroll,
      even if it's worse than the original roll. <i>Allegro</i> dispels and is
      dispelled by <i>slow</i>.</p>
