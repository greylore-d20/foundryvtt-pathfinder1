      Thrown</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The chakram is a simple, elegant, and
      highly portable thrown weapon. It is a flat, open-centered metal discus
      with a sharpened edge. You can wield the chakram as a melee weapon, but it
      is not designed for such use; you take a -1 penalty on your attack roll
      with the weapon and must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or cut yourself on
      the blade (half damage, no Strength modifier). You do not need to make
      this save if wearing heavy armor.</p>
