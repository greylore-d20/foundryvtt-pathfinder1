  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it heal damage
      instead of dealing it. Creating a healing bomb requires the alchemist to
      expend an infused extract or potion containing a cure spell. A creature
      that takes a direct hit from a healing bomb is healed as if she had
      imbibed the infusion or potion used to create the bomb. Creatures in the
      splash radius are healed for the minimum amount of damage the cure spell
      is capable of healing. A healing bomb damages undead instead of healing
      them.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to <em>bomb</em>
      class feature.</p><p>Roll exctract effect for heal effect after using
      bombs throw action.</p>
