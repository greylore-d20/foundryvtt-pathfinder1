    "shortDescription": "<p>One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he became a god, Aroden's <i>spellbane</i> creates an area within which spells selected by you simply do not function.</p><p>Select one spell per five caster levels at the time of casting.</p><p>The spells selected cannot be changed after the spell is cast. Aroden's <i>spellbane</i> otherwise functions like <i>antimagic field</i>, except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells. Only the exact spells mentioned are affected-a <i>spellbane</i> set to prevent the casting of summon nature's ally II would not prevent castings of summon nature's ally I or summon nature's ally III. If you move into an area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is in effect, that spell is affected as if by <i>antimagic field</i>. If the spell affects a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out.</p><p>Aroden's <i>spellbane</i> can even negate an <i>antimagic field</i>, another Aroden's <i>spellbane</i>, or any spell that specifies immunity to <i>antimagic field</i> (such as <i>Wall of Force</i>, <i><i>prismatic</i> sphere</i>, and <i>prismatic</i> wall). Multiple <i>spellbane</i> effects can overlap.</p><p>Their effects stack, preventing the functioning of every spell targeted by any of the multiple <i>spellbane</i> emanations. Spell effects created by artifacts or deities cannot be suppressed by Aroden's <i>spellbane</i>.</p>",
