      <p>Kineticists are living channels for elemental matter and energy,
      manipulating the world around them by drawing upon inner reserves from
      their own bodies. Kineticists often awaken to their kinetic abilities
      during a violent or traumatic experience, releasing their power
      involuntarily. As kinetic power is seldom inherited, kineticists are
      rarely able to find mentors to guide them, so they must delve into these
      mysteries on their own to learn to control their gifts.</p>

      <p><b>Role:</b> Kineticists generally use their powers to assail their
      foes from range, but based on the way their talents develop, they can
      channel their kinetic abilities for a variety of situations. Kineticists
      are usually quite different from their families and friends, so they often
      strike out on their own or alongside others with extraordinary
      talents.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment:</b> Any.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 1d6 × 10 gp (average 35 gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>
