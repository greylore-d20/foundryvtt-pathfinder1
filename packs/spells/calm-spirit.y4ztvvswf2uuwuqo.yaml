  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell temporarily calms agitated haunts and incorporeal undead
      such as ghosts. You have no control over the affected creatures, but
      <i>calm spirit</i> postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for
      the duration of the spell. Entities so affected cannot take violent
      actions or do anything destructive, including triggering persistent haunt
      abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any aggressive action
      against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately ends the
      effect.  Haunts do not receive a saving throw against the spell, but the
      caster must succeed at a caster level check whose difficulty is equal to
      at least 10 + the haunt's CR in order to temporarily calm the angry
      entity. The spell's duration changes to concentration (up to 1
      round/level) when affecting a haunt.</p>
