      "value": "<p>At 15th level, the cavalier becomes an unstoppable engine of destruction. If the cavalier’s current hit points drop below 0, he does not fall unconscious. Instead, he continues to act so long as his negative hit point total does not exceed the amount of damage he dealt to an enemy on a single melee attack during the last round. The cavalier receives no Constitution check to stabilize while using this ability, and automatically takes 1 point of damage each round. When his current negative hit points exceed his negative Constitution score, the amount of damage he must deal to continue to act is now equal to the difference between his current negative hit point total and his negative Constitution score. Additionally, the cavalier can no longer benefit from magical healing (save for a @Compendium[pf1.spells.nnj51dwfkwd15ngj]{Wish}&nbsp;or @Compendium[pf1.spells.suel7sgnztenv551]{Miracle}&nbsp;spell), and he immediately dies once he can no longer take an action due to this ability.</p>"
