      <p>This backpack has numerous pockets for storing items that might be
      needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for attaching items such as
      canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that
      strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly.
      Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its
      main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength
      score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying
      capacity.</p>
