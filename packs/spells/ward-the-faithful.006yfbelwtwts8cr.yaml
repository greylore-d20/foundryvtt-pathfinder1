      <p>All creatures within the area who worship the same god as you gain a +2
      deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on all saves. At 12th
      level, these bonuses increase to +3. At 18th level, the bonuses increase
      to +4.</p><p>If you do not worship a specific deity, the bonuses apply to
      those who share your faith. If you do not have a specific faith or
      religion, the spell provides benefits only to yourself. Enemies gain the
      benefits of this spell if they worship the same god or share the same
      faith as you, even if you view them as heretical.</p>
