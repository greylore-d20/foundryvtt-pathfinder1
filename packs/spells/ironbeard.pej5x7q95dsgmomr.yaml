  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell causes a brushy beard of stiff iron to erupt from the face of
    a willing target. The <i>ironbeard</i> grants a +1 armor bonus to AC, and
    this bonus stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The <i>ironbeard</i>
    may also be used as a weapon equivalent to cold iron armor spikes. The
    <i>ironbeard</i> makes it difficult to speak, so any spellcasting with a
    verbal component has a 20% spell failure chance.</p>
