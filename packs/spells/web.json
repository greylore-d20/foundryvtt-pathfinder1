    "shortDescription": "<p><i>Web</i> creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider<i>web</i>s but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the <i>web</i> collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a <i>web</i> become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a <i>web</i> doesn't cause you to become grappled.</p><p>Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the <i>web</i> but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the <i>web</i> is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the <i>web</i>s must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell's DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of <i>web</i>bing that they enter.</p><p>If you have at least 5 feet of <i>web</i> between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of <i>web</i> between you, it provides total cover.</p><p>The strands of a <i>web</i> spell are flammable. A <i>flaming weapon</i> can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cob<i>web</i>s. Any fire can set the <i>web</i>s alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming <i>web</i>s take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.</p><p><i>Web</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>web</i> that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.</p>",
