      "value": "<p><em>The aspect of the wasp grants flight and a venomous sting, as well as great mental resistance. A giant wasp’s alternate attack is sting (P).</em><p><strong>Minor Form:</strong> You gain a +4 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting affects.</p>\n<p>This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.<p><strong>Major Form:</strong> Your shape changes to that of a <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Giant%20Wasp\">giant wasp</a>. This ability uses the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=vermin%20shape%20I\">vermin shape</a> spell, rather than <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=beast%20shape%20I\">beast shape</a>, for the purposes of wild shape. While in this form, you gain a fly speed of 40 feet (clumsy), and swarms and vermin do not attack you unless magically commanded to do so.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, this fly speed increases to 60 feet (average), and you gain a sting attack usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, which applies the following poison.<p><em>Wasp Venom (Ex)</em> Sting—injury; save Fort DC = 10 + half your shifter level + your Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.<p>At 15th level, your fly speed increases to 80 feet (good), and you can attempt to gain control of a mindless swarm as a full-round action. To gain control of the swarm, you must succeed at a Charisma check against a DC of 10 + the swarm’s CR. You can direct the swarm to disperse, remain in a designated location, or attack an opponent. This control lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your shifter level.<p><strong>Alternate Natural Attacks:</strong> Sting (P)</p>"
