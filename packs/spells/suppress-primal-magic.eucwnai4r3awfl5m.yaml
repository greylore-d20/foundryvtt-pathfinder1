    value: >-
      <p>Nexian wizards first created this spell while researching the nature of
      the Mana Wastes, hoping to create small zones within the magic-starved
      region where their own spells could still function reliably. The best the
      Nexians could manage was this spell-a method to temporarily stabilize
      magic so that spellcasting within a small area can be accomplished without
      fear of triggering primal magic events. In the area of effect of this
      spell, primal magic events cannot be triggered.</p><p>The emanation grants
      a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against effects generated by
      primal magic outside of the spell's effect that expand into the
      area.</p><p>Unfortunately, suppressed primal magic tends to build up
      around the emanation created by this spell. When <i>suppress primal
      magic</i>'s duration ends (or when the spell is dispelled), a primal magic
      event is immediately triggered at the center of the emanation if that
      point is still in an area where primal magic is active. The CR of this
      event is equal to the caster level of the recently ended <i>suppress
      primal magic</i> spell. The original caster of the <i>suppress primal
      magic</i> spell can attempt to negate this triggered primal magic event by
      making a DC 20 Will save-most spellcasters instead relocate to an area not
      affected by primal magic if they can so that they can end the spell's
      effect safely.</p>
