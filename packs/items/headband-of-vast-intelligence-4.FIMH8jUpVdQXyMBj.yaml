      <p>This intricate gold headband is decorated with several small blue and
      deep purple gemstones.</p><p>The headband grants the wearer an
      <em>enhancement bonus</em> to <em>Intelligence</em> of +2, +4, or +6.
      Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the
      headband is worn. A headband of vast intelligence has one skill associated
      with it per +2 bonus it grants. After being worn for 24 hours, the
      headband grants a number of skill ranks in those skills equal to the
      wearerâ€™s total <em>Hit Dice</em>. These ranks do not stack with the ranks
      a creature already possesses. These skills are chosen when the headband is
      created. If no skill is listed, the headband is assumed to grant skill
      ranks in randomly determined <em>Knowledge</em>
      skills.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong>
