      <p>At 15th level, your ectoplasmic tendrils can lash out at creatures
      around you. Treat this as a @Compendium[pf1.spells.wralcmyi4tdcai24]{Black
      Tentacles} effect centered on your position, but the tentacles can also
      <em>grapple</em> ethereal and <em>incorporeal</em> creatures, and they do
      not affect you (though they still affect your allies). You can use this
      ability a number of rounds per day equal to your <em>sorcerer</em> level.
      These rounds need not be consecutive.</p>
