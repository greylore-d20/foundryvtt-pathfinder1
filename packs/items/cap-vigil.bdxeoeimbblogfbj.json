The helmet's arms can be adjusted (as a <em>full-round action</em> that provokes <em>attacks of opportunity</em>) into one of the following modes at a given time:</p>\n<p><b>All-Around Perspective</b>: When properly angled, the mirrors grant the wearer a better view of his surroundings and attacking foes. In this mode, the helmet grants a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on reactive sight-based <em>Perception</em> checks.</p>\n<p><b>Indirect Observation</b>: Intended to protect against <em>gaze</em> attacks, this mode combines shades positioned to block forward vision with mirrors angled to let the wearer see around him. Any time he would normally have to attempt a saving throw against a <em>gaze</em> attack, there is a 75% chance he doesn't need to attempt the save. Because of the wearer's obscured vision, however, all foes gain partial <em>concealment</em> (10% miss chance) against him.</p>\n<p><b>Shades</b>: With the mirrors tucked aside, the shades provide a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on saving throws against effects that <em>blind</em> or dazzle.</p>"
