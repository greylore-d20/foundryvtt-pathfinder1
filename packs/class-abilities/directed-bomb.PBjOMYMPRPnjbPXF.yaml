  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist can cause his bombs to splash in a 15-foot cone instead
      of a 5-foot-radius burst. The alchemist chooses the direction of the cone.
      If the attack misses, roll an additional 1d8 to determine the direction of
      the blast from where the bomb lands. This discovery can't be combined with
      the explosive bomb discovery.</p>
