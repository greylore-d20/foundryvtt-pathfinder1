    value: >-
      <p>This light steel shield is specially crafted with a series of straps to
      allow a character proficient in shields to ready or stow it on her back
      quickly and easily. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you
      may don or put away a quickdraw shield as a swift action combined with a
      regular move. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, you can draw a
      light or onehanded weapon with one hand and a quickdraw shield with the
      other in the time it would normally take you to draw one weapon. If you
      have the Quick Draw feat, you may don or put away a quickdraw shield as a
      free action.</p>
