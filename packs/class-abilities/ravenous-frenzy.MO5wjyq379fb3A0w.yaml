  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you gain the benefits of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.s9amdo5398alb5p0]{Haste} for a number of rounds per
      day equal to your <em>sorcerer</em> level. These rounds donâ€™t need to be
      consecutive. Each time you hit a creature with two or more claw attacks
      during a full attack while affected by this ability, that creature takes
      1d4 points of <em>bleed</em> damage.</p>
