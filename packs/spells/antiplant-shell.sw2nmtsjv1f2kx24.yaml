  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The <i>antiplant shell</i> spell creates an invisible, mobile barrier
      that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacks by plant
      creatures or animated plants. As with many abjuration spells, forcing the
      barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay strains and
      collapses the field.</p>
