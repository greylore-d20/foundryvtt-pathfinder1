      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unravel
      a magical effect. This functions as a targeted
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic} spell, but you must
      be adjacent to the effect to unravel it. If the effect is created by
      psychic magic, you receive a +5 bonus on your caster level check to
      unravel it. If the effect targets an object in your possession, you
      automatically succeed at the check.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
