  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with
      astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time
      to create alchemical items. He can also apply <em>poison</em> to a weapon
      as a <em>move action</em> instead of a <em>standard action</em>.</p>
