      <p>These ceremonial clothes are worn when performing priestly functions
      within a church or temple, and aren’t well suited to adventuring. A
      cleric’s vestments typically include a cassock, stole, and surplice. The
      colors usually correspond to the deity worshiped, and while some priests
      may choose elaborate embroidery with ecclesiastical themes, others find
      merit in humble simplicity.</p>
