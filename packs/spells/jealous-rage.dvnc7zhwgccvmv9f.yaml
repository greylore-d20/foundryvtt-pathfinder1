  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You fill the target with a sense of entitled self-importance, making the
    subject unable to bear the indignity of another creature getting something
    that it doesn't have. Whenever an ally of the target receives a harmless
    spell or spell-like ability, beneficial supernatural effect, or assisting
    action (including the aid another action, first aid using the Heal skill,
    etc.) that doesn't also include the target, the target is driven into a
    murderous rage against either the producer of that effect or the nearest
    creature that benefited from that effect, whichever is closer. The target
    must attack that creature on its next turn. Any ability that deals lethal
    damage is considered an attack for this purpose. Once the target deals
    lethal damage to the object of his <i>jealous rage</i>, the compulsion to
    attack that creature ends.</p>
