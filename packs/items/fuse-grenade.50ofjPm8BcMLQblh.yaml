      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This hollow clay container holds a small charge of black power and a
      slow-burning fuse. Lighting the fuse is a move action; 1d3 rounds later
      the grenade explodes, dealing 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d6
      points of fire damage in a 10-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 15 halves). You
      throw a fuse grenade as if it were a splash weapon. Crafting this item is
      a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>
