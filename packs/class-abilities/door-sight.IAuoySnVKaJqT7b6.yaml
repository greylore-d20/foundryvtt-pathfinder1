    value: >-
      <p>You can lay your hand upon any surface and see what is on the other
      side, as if using clairvoyance. Using this power takes 1 minute, during
      which time you must be touching the surface you want to see through. You
      can keep looking for as long as 10 minutes with each use of this power,
      but must touch the surface and take no other action the entire time. The
      surface cannot be thicker than 6 inches plus 1 inch per cleric level you
      possess. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Agile Feet power of the Travel Domain.</p>
