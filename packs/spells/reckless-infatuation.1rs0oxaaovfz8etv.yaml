  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You fill your target with feelings of intense infatuation for a specific
    individual known to the target. At the time of the casting, you designate a
    single creature as the focus of the target's desire.</p><p>Thereafter, the
    target does all it can to remain within 30 feet of the object of its desire.
    If the target moves outside this range, it gains the staggered condition
    until it is again near the focus of its desire. If remaining within 30 feet
    of the focus of its affection would place the target in obvious physical
    danger, the target can attempt a second save to break the spell's
    effect.</p><p><i>Reckless infatuation</i> counters <i>unadulterated
    loathing</i>.</p>
