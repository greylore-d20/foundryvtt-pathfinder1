    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon learns to cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{Dimension Door} as a spell-like
      ability once per day. The caster level for this evolution is equal to the
      eidolon's Hit Dice. The save DC for this spell is 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's
      HD + the eidolon's Charisma modifier. The eidolon must have a Charisma
      score of at least 14 to take this evolution.</p>

      <p>The summoner must be at least 13th level before selecting this
      evolution.</p>
