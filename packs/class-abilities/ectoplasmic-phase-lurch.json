In order to use this ability, it must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it’s moving through. An ectoplasmic phantom can’t move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle.</p>\n<p>Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.</p>"
