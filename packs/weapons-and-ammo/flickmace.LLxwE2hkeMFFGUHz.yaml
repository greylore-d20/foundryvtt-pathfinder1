  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The innovation behind a flick-mace, which has an ordinary mace head,
      lies within its spring-loaded haft and protruding handles. When the mace
      is compressed, removing the handles instantly springs the mace to its full
      size. While it is extended, a quick flick of the wrist allows the weapon
      to be compressed.</p>
