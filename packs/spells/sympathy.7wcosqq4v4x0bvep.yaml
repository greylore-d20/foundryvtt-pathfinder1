      <p>You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that
      attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a
      particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular kind of creature
      to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not
      specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be
      named.</p><p>Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and
      pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The
      compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the
      save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a
      subsequent save must be made 1d6 x 10 minutes later. If this save fails,
      the affected creature attempts to return to the area or
      object.</p><p><i>Sympathy</i> counters and dispels <i>antipathy</i>.</p>
