      <p>These alchemical powders have a gritty consistency. When poured on a
      weapon and placed over a hot flame for a full round, they melt and form a
      temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives the weapon the
      ability to bypass one kind of material-based <em>damage reduction</em>,
      such as <em>adamantine</em>, cold iron, or silver. The blanching remains
      effective until the weapon makes a successful attack. Each dose of
      blanching can coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only one
      kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made
      of one special material (such as <em>adamantine</em>) can have a different
      material blanch (such as silver), and counts as both materials for the
      first successful hit.</p>

      <p><em>Ghost Salt</em>: This gritty alchemical powder is made from exotic
      minerals mixed with an infusion crafted from the ectoplasmic remains of
      destroyed <em>incorporeal</em> <em>undead</em>. When rubbed onto a weapon
      that is then placed over a hot flame for a full round, ghost salt melts
      and forms a temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives the
      weapon the ability to do full damage to <em>incorporeal</em> creatures,
      even if the weapon itself is non-magical. An application of ghost salt
      remains effective until the weapon makes a successful attack. Each dose of
      weapon blanch can coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only
      one kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time.</p>

      <p>These silver, alchemical powders have a gritty consistency, appearing
      at first glance to be simple metal shavings. When poured on a weapon and
      placed over a hot flame for a full round, however, they melt and form a
      temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives the weapon the
      ability to bypass one kind of material-based damage reduction, such as
      adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The blanching remains effective until
      you make a successful attack with the weapon. Each dose of blanching can
      coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only one kind of weapon
      blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made of one special
      material (such as adamantine) can have a different material blanch (such
      as silver), and counts as both materials for the first successful hit.</p>
