    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, when the rogue would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points
      by a melee attack, she can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action. If
      the movement takes her out of the reach of the attack, she takes no damage
      from the attack. The rogue is staggered for 1 round on her next turn.</p>
