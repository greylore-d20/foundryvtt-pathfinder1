  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can use a readied action to counterspell any spell being cast on
      you or an adjacent ally that requires a ranged touch attack (such as a
      ray). In order to successfully counter the spell, you must make an unarmed
      attack roll. If the result of this attack roll is higher than 20 + the
      spellâ€™s caster level, the spell is negated with no effect.</p>

      <p>At 17th level, any spell you successfully negate is reflected back at
      the caster with the same ranged touch attack result.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level before selecting this revelation.</p>
