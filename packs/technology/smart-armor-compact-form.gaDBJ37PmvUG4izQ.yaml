      minutes</p><h3>Description</h3><p>While inactive, smart armor resembles a
      breastplate of adamantine scales, which doesn't seem out of place among
      the metal armor of Golarion, except for its the alien aesthetics of its
      Androffan design. When activated as an immediate action, smart armor
      expands to cover the wearer's legs and limbs, and a built-in magnetic
      generator hardens the armor into a rigid, plate-like form. When in this
      form, it uses the statistics of smart armor (expanded form). It can be
      collapsed back to breastplate form with a move action, and automatically
      retracts when it loses power. In either form, smart armor provides DR 2/-
      due to its adamantine construction. Smart armor is considered masterwork
      armor.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 28;
