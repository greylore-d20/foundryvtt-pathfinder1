      <p>This sealed vial contains 1 ounce of milky white gel. Once the vial's
      seal is broken, the liquid reacts with the surrounding air and begins to
      rapidly heat up, glowing like a candle for 1 hour. After that hour, the
      oxidization of the chemical agent is complete, and the gel dissolves in a
      white-hot flash, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage to anything directly in
      contact with it. A single dose of phosphorescent gel can coat 6 square
      inches of a surface. Multiple doses of phosphorescent gel can be used to
      coat larger surfaces, but the amount of damage dealt does not stack. The
      conflagration occurs in an instant, and the fire generated doesn't spread,
      though it can be used to ignite a larger explosive such as a fuse grenade
      or pot of oil.</p>
