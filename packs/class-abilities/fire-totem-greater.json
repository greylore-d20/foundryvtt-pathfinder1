Creatures in the affected area must succeed at Fortitude saves each round or <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Smoke%20Effects&amp;Category=Environmental%20Rules\">suffer the effects of breathing heavy smoke</a>. The barbarian is immune to the smoke’s effects, including vision obstruction. She can end this smoke as a free action, or it can be dispersed by wind in the same manner as a @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud} spell.</p>"
