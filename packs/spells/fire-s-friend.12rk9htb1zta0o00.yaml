  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cloak yourself in flames that do not harm you or your carried
    equipment but damage other creatures and objects. The flames cast light as a
    torch. Any creature that attacks you with a non-reach melee weapon or that
    begins its turn engaged in a grapple with you takes 1d6 points of fire
    damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. The creature can
    negate the damage (and avoid catching fire) with spell resistance. Any time
    you end your movement in the same square as a flammable object or creature,
    that creature or object must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire.</p>
