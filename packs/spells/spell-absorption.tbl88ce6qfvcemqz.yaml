    value: >-
      <p>If you successfully counterspell a 3rd-level or lower level spell
      (through either <i>dispel magic</i> or normal means) while <i>spell
      absorption</i> is in effect, you absorb the countered spell and use it to
      regain spells you have already cast. If you're a wizard, you regain the
      use of any single spell that you have cast since the last time you
      prepared spells. If you're a sorcerer, you regain a single spell slot. The
      spell recovered or spell slot regained must be of an equal level or lower
      than the spell you counterspelled.</p>
