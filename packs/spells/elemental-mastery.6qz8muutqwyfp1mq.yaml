  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain mastery over the element matching the elemental essence in
      your blood (fire for ifrits, earth for oreads, air for sylphs, and water
      for undines). If you are a suli, you can choose any one of the four
      options as you cast this spell, but the duration is reduced to 1 round per
      level. Your mastery gives you an insight bonus to your speed or a new
      movement mode, depending on the element you master, and grants one
      additional benefit. This spell's descriptor matches the chosen element.
