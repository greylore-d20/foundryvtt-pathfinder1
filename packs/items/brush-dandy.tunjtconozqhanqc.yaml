      <p>This hard-bristled tool has a handle that slips over the wearer's hand,
      and is used by <em>animal</em> breeders, owners, and grooms to brush the
      <em>animals</em> in their care, loosening dirt and detritus from the
      creatures' coats and stimulating the skin so it produces the natural oils
      that keep them healthy and clean.</p>
