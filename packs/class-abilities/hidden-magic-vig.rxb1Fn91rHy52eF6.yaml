  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The auras of magic items the vigilante is carrying are hidden (as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.l01ajd0m4xgwq3fd]{magic aura}). The vigilante
      can suppress or reactivate this effect as a standard action. At 11th
      level, the vigilante and any magic items he is carrying appear to be
      nonmagical (as if he had cast
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.3anuql2qioluspuv]{greater magic aura}). The
      vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.</p>
