  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the shaman can make a melee touch attack infused
      with negative energy that deals 1d4 points of damage + 1 point of damage
      for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. She can instead touch an undead
      creature to heal it of the same amount of damage.</p>

      <p>A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      her Charisma modifier.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, any weapon that the shaman wields is treated as an
      unholy weapon.</p>
