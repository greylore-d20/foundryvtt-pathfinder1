      <p>You cause ammunition, including shuriken, to exude radiant energy.
      Creatures that take penalties in bright light take these penalties for 1
      round after being struck by such ammunition. Undead and creatures harmed
      by sunlight take an additional 1d6 points of damage from such projectiles.
      This extra damage and half of any other damage you deal with an affected
      projectile results directly from radiant energy and is not subject to
      damage resistance. Such a projectile sheds light as if it were a sunrod
      for 1 round after it is fired or thrown.</p>
