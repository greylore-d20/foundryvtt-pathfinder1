  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you charge, you can make a full attack at the end of that charge,
      but only with claw attacks you have, and you can make only one attack per
      claw. If you have abilities that grant bonuses on damage rolls or that
      apply other special effects to charge attacks, only the first claw attack
      benefits from these bonuses. When you make a claw attack as an attack of
      opportunity, you can expend one additional use of your attacks of
      opportunity to make an additional claw attack against the target that
      provoked the attack.</p>
