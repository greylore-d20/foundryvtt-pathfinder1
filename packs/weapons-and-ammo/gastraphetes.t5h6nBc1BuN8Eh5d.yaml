  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The gastraphetes, sometimes called a "belly bow," is an oversized
      crossbow reloaded by pressing one end against the ground, the other
      against one's abdomen, and locking the string in place through ratchet
      action. Reloading takes a full-round action, uses two hands, and requires
      that the wielder be standing. Wielding a gastraphetes requires two hands,
      and due to the weapon's bulk, firing it while standing without support
      (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imposes a -4 penalty on attack
      rolls; you take no penalty for firing a gastraphetes while prone. A Large
      or larger creature can use a gastraphetes one size smaller than itself
      without any support, but takes the normal penalty for firing an
      inappropriately sized weapon.</p>
