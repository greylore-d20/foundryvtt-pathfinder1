      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Marbles can be used to slow opponents. One 2-pound bag of marbles
      covers an area 5 feet square. A creature entering a square with marbles
      scattered on it must succeed at a DC 10 Reflex save or fall prone (the
      creatureâ€™s stability bonus to trip applies to this save). Any creature
      moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a square of
      marbles with no trouble.</p>
