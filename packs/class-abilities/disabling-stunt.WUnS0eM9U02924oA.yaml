    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can attempt a Disable Device check against
      a construct’s CMD as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. If the check is successful, the character can ignore the
      construct’s damage reduction when dealing sneak attack damage for 1
      minute. The normal penalties apply to this check if the character attempts
      it without using thieves’ tools. A character must be trained in Disable
      Device to select this talent.</p>
