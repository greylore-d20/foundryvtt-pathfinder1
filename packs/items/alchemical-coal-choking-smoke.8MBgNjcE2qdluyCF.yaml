      <p>A kobold who chews and swallows this alchemically treated piece of coal
      (a <em>full-round action</em>) can make one <em>breath weapon</em> attack
      during the next minute. If the kobold fails to make a breath attack before
      this minute expires, it is <em>sickened</em> for 1 hour. Other
      <em>humanoid</em> creatures that eat alchemical coal are <em>sickened</em>
      for 1 hour (though certain other creatures may be able to use them, at the
      GM's discretion). Creatures that are immune to <em>poison</em> are immune
      to the <em>sickened</em> effect. The type of <em>breath weapon</em>
      depends on the type of alchemical coal that is chewed by the
      kobold.</p><p><em>Choking Smoke</em>: This crumbling chunk of chalky white
      coal allows a kobold to breathe a 15-foot cone of foul vapor that deals
      1d6 points of acid damage and sickens a creature for 1d4 rounds. A
      creature that succeeds at a DC 15 <em>Reflex</em> saving throw takes half
      damage and is not
      <em>sickened</em>.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft
