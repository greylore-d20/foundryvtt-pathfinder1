      <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that every
      creature within 60 feet of a <i>Symbol of Weakness</i> instead suffers
      crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.</p><p>Unlike
      <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>Symbol of Weakness</i> has no hit point limit;
      once triggered, a <i>Symbol of Weakness</i> simply remains active for 10
      minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol
      once.</p><p><i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as <i>Symbol of Weakness</i> are
      hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find
      a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use
      Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or
      32 for <i>Symbol of Weakness</i>.</p>
