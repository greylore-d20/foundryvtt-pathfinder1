    value: >-
      <p>You plumb the depths of your mind for insight, leaving you momentarily
      frazzled. When you are about to make a d20 roll based on Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma, you can cast this spell to gain a +8 enhancement
      bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for that roll, but you are
      dazed for 1 round afterward.</p>
