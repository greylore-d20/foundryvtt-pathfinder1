      <p>Whenever a creature you can see that threatens you makes an attack
      against one of your allies, as an immediate action, you can compel that
      creature to attack you instead. When you compel a creature to attack you,
      you must first overcome that creature's spell resistance, and the creature
      can attempt a Will saving throw to ignore the compulsion.</p><p>A summoner
      casting this spell can choose his eidolon as the target of the spell.</p>
