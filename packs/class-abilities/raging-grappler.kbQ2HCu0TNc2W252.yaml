  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian grapples her foes with the power and
      viciousness of a river crocodile. As long as she is raging, whenever the
      barbarian succeeds at a check to start a grapple, she can choose to deal
      damage as if she had also succeeded at a check to maintain the grapple. In
      addition, while she is raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a combat
      maneuver check to maintain a grapple, she can choose to give herself, the
      target of her grapple, or both the prone condition as a free action while
      continuing to maintain the grapple.</p>
