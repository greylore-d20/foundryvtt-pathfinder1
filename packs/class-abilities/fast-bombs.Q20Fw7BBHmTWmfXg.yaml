  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to
      throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw
      additional bombs as a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high
      enough to grant him additional attacks. This functions just like a
      full-attack with a ranged weapon.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
