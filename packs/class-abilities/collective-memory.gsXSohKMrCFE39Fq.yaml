  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist adds half his
      class level on all Knowledge skill checks and may attempt all Knowledge
      skill checks untrained. This bonus does not stack with the second
      Intelligence bonus granted by the mindchemist archetypeâ€™s perfect recall
      class feature.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must have the cognatogen discovery before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
