  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action when you cast a spell with a duration of at least 1
      minute per caster level, you can increase the spellâ€™s effective caster
      level by 1 for the purpose of determining its duration and preventing
      attempts to dispel it. The effective caster level increases by an
      additional 1 for every 10 cleric levels you have (maximum +3). You can use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Hand of the Acolyte power of the Arcane
      Domain.</p>
