    value: >-
      <p>You create the sound of a large hunting horn, blowing up to three notes
      as loud as a roaring dragon. These notes can be heard up to 2 miles away
      in typical outdoor conditions.</p><p>You can make these sounds at any
      point during the spell's duration as a free action, and each sounding can
      be short or long, allowing you to send very simple coded messages.</p>
