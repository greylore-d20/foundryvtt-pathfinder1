    "shortDescription": "<p>You befuddle the target's mind, making it more willing to believe even the most outlandish tales. The target takes a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks for the spell's duration. In addition, creatures that attempt to lie to or deceive the target gain a +10 bonus on their Bluff checks, as if the target wanted to believe them and was drunk or impaired simultaneously. Furthermore, the believability of any lie told to a creature under the effects of <i>gullibility</i> increases by one step; an impossible lie seems far-fetched, a far-fetched lie seems unlikely, and an unlikely lie seems believable.  A creature gains no benefits from <i>glibness</i> on B luff checks to lie to or deceive a creature that is under the effects of <i>gullibility</i>; in effect, <i>gullibility</i> r enders a t arget s o w illing t o believe what others say that <i>glibness</i> cannot make their words any more believable.</p>"
