      "value": "<p>The shaman can grow a pair of wings for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. Initially, these wings lack the power to allow the shaman to fly, but the shaman can use them as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small shaman).</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, she can use the wings to safely descend any distance, as if using the @Compendium[pf1.spells.68m9du7zw2di7ew6]{Feather Fall}&nbsp;spell.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, she can use the wings to fly with poor maneuverability and a fly speed of 30 feet, but the shaman must land at the end of each turn or fall.</p>\n<p>A shaman of 8th level or higher can select the wings hex a second time. This doubles the number of minutes per day the shaman can use her wings (2 minutes per level), and allows her to fly with average maneuverability and a fly speed of 30 feet while the wings are active.</p>"
