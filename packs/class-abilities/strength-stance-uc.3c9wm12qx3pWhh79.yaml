  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian can summon mighty strength. She gains a +1 competence
      bonus on combat maneuvers and to her CMD. These bonuses increase by 1 for
      every 4 levels the barbarian has. In addition, she gains a +8 competence
      bonus on Strength checks to lift, push, bend, or break objects (this does
      not apply to combat maneuvers).</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>

      <p>Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A barbarian can’t have
      more than one stance rage power active at a time. If she activates a
      stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance
      immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning
      of the barbarian’s turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the
      rage ends.</p>
