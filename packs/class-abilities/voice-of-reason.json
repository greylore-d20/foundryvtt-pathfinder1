The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw to disbelieve a sight-based illusion effect, but only so long as the mesmerist is not affected by or has disbelieved the illusion himself. The subject receives an insight bonus on her saving throw to disbelieve the illusion equal to the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>This trick cannot be used for illusions that do not allow a saving throw.</p>"
