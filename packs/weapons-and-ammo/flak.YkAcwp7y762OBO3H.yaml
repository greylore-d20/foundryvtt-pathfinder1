      <h3>Description</h3><p>Flak ammunition is a type of short-fused bomb,
      specifically  designed to explode in midair. Flak ammunition is packed
      with  steel balls and black powder, and may be fired from a bombard  or
      catapult. When flak explodes, it deals 4d6 points of piercing  and
      bludgeoning damage to all creatures and objects within 40  feet of the
      target square. A flak bomb must reach an altitude of  at least 50 feet to
      function properly. If flak ammunition impacts  anything before it reaches
      this altitude, the bomb deals 1d6  points of bludgeoning damage and fails
      to explode.</p>
