    value: >-
      <p>You allow two chosen champions to fight without interference. The two
      creatures must be willing in order for the spell to work. After you cast
      this spell, any creature attempting to aid or hinder either of the two
      targets in any way must succeed at a Will save or lose its action instead
      (spell resistance applies). A creature that fails its Will save against
      champion's bout cannot attempt to interfere again. If a creature
      successfully interferes with the bout, the spell ends immediately.</p>
