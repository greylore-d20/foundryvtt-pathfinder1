      <p>Choose a creature within range as the object of hunger. All other
      creatures within 15 feet of the target that can see or smell the target's
      delectable flesh must succeed at a Will save or spiral into a depraved
      state from which they gain a single purpose — to consume as much of the
      target's delicious flesh as possible. The creature chosen as the target of
      this spell is not affected by this depravity.</p>

      <p>A depraved creature gains a bite attack, two claw attacks, and the
      scent ability if it didn't already have them. It drops any items it was
      carrying and attacks the target of the spell with these natural weapons,
      acting as if it were confused and the target had attacked it first. This
      effect lasts for the spell's duration or until the depraved creature can
      no longer see or smell the object of its hunger for a full minute.
      Additionally, a depraved creature can attempt a new saving throw to end
      this effect at the end of any turn in which the affected creature makes an
      attack against the object of its hunger. If a creature that eats for
      nourishment succeeds at a save to end the depraved effect early, it takes
      a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, concentration checks, saving
      throws, and skill checks whenever it is within 15 feet of the target.</p>
