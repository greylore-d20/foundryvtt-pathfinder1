    "shortDescription": "<p>A <i>statue</i> spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. In <i>statue</i> form, the subject gains hardness 8. The subject retains its own hit points.</p><p>The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body.</p><p>Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the <i>statue</i>'s arms constitutes serious damage. The subject of a <i>statue</i> spell can return to its normal state, act, and then return instantly to the <i>statue</i> state (a free action) if it so desires as long as the spell duration is in effect.</p>",
