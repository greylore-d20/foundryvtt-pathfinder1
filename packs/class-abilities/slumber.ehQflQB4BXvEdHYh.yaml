    value: >-
      <p>A witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to fall into a deep,
      magical sleep, as per the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.3plb67e51webutdz]{sleep}.</p><p>The creature
      receives a Will save to negate the effect. If the save fails, the creature
      falls asleep for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. This hex
      can affect a creature of any HD. The creature will not wake due to noise
      or light, but others can rouse it with a standard action. This hex ends
      immediately if the creature takes damage.</p><p>Whether or not the save is
      successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1
      day.</p>
