He can choose from among the following inquisitor judgments: destruction, piercing, purity, and smiting. For the purpose of determining the bonuses provided by this ability, the vigilante’s level stacks with levels in any other classes that grant judgment or harsh judgment. The vigilante can use this ability once per day plus an additional time per day at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter (up to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level).</p>\n<p>Only a vigilante with the Zealot archetype can select this talent.</p>"
