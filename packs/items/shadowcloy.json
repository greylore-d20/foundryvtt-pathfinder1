Its cloying vapors cling to a target, obscuring vision for a short period of time. You can throw a shadowcloy flask as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon\">splash weapon</a> with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit means the target treats the ambient light as one category darker than normal, with a creature already in natural darkness treating it as <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-\">supernatural</a> darkness. This effect lasts for 1 round. A thrown shadowcloy flask has no effect on adjacent creatures or if it misses.</p>\r\n"
