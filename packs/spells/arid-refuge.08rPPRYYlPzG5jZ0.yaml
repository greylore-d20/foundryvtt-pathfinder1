  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a small stone building on any relatively flat nonliving
      surface at least 20 feet square that can support its weight (such as the
      ocean floor or an underwater ridge). The outline of a door is marked on
      one wall of your choice or on the roof. You and anyone you designate as
      the spell is cast can pass through the door, which is actually an opaque
      membrane of force that keeps the surrounding atmosphere from entering the
      structure. Creatures you have not designated can force their way through
      the door with a successful DC 28 Strength check. The shelter is as strong
      as a normal stone building, resists flames and fire as if it were stone,
      and is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege
      engines or giants).</p>

      <p> The shelter contains eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a
      writing desk. These furnishings disappear if removed from the shelter. The
      shelter contains fresh, breathable air that replenishes within the shelter
      but does not pass through the membrane of force. The shelter's interior
      maintains a temperature of 70Â° F regardless of the temperature outside the
      shelter.</p>

      <p>This spell can be cast only underwater.</p>
