  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, when flanked by at least two opponents, a character with
      this talent can, as an immediate action when any of the threatening
      opponents attacks her, attempt an Acrobatics check against the highest CMD
      of the threatening creatures plus 2 per threatening creature beyond the
      second. If successful, the character may take a 5-foot step in any
      direction, so long as she remains within the reach of the attacker
      triggering the movement. The characterâ€™s final position is used to
      determine whether the attacker benefits from flanking. On a failed check,
      the character falls prone in her original position and the attack resolves
      as normal (the opponent gains a +4 bonus for attacking a prone target). A
      character may use this ability one additional time per day for every 5
      class levels she possesses. A rogue must be trained in Acrobatics to
      select this talent.</p>
