      <p>This tall, teapot-like device contains a small chamber for coffee
      grounds and a large chamber for water, connected by a small tube. Heating
      the <em>pot</em> forces boiling water through the tube and into the
      grounds. A glass knob at the top of the tube allows you to see the color
      of the brew and stop when it is sufficiently strong. It can brew up to 4
      cups of coffee at a time. It can also be used to make <em>tea</em>, steep
      medicinal herbs, or just boil water.</p>
