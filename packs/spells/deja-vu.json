    "shortDescription": "<p>You reach into the target's mind and put its thought processes into a temporary loop. Whatever full-round, standard, or move actions the creature takes on its first turn after you cast this spell, it must repeat on the turn after that. The creature must take the same type of actions in the same order (for example, making a full attack, casting a specific spell, withdrawing, attempting a bull rush combat maneuver, or activating a magic item) and must act against the same target or targets, but doesn't have to make exactly the same choices (such as using Power Attack when attacking, moving exactly 15 feet, or choosing \"drop\" for the <i>command</i> spell). If the circumstances would prevent the target from repeating an action, such as if the target of its attack is dead or the target cannot cast the same spell again, the target instead becomes confused until the spell ends. A creature currently affected by <i>deja vu</i> can't be targeted with another <i>deja vu</i> spell. A creature affected by <i>deja vu</i> can't delay, and if it readies an action on its first turn, it must ready the same action on its second turn.</p>",
