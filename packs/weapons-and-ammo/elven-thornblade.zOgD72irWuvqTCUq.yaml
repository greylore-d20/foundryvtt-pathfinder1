  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This blade is suited for thrusts and parries, making it especially
      capable of inflicting deep, penetrating wounds. A wielder with Weapon
      Finesse can apply her Dexterity modifier to attack rolls with an elven
      thornblade instead of her Strength modifier. An elven thornblade grants no
      additional benefit when wielded two-handed. In addition, attacks with an
      elven thornblade gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical
      hits.</p>
