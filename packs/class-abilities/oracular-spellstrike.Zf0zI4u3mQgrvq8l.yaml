  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By harnessing a synergy of unarmed combat and spellcasting, you have
      uncovered a means of channeling spell energy quickly through your unarmed
      strikes. This resembles the magus spellstrike ability, except it works
      with unarmed strikes only, no matter what other abilities you have.
      Additionally, it uses spells from the cleric spell list, not the magus
      spell list.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.</p>
