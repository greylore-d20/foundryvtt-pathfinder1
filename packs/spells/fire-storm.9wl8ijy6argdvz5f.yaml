  shortDescription: >-
    <p>When a <i>fire storm</i> spell is cast, the whole area is shot through
    with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural
    vegetation, ground cover, or any plant creatures in the area that you wish
    to exclude from damage. Any other creature within the area takes 1d6 points
    of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures that fail their
    Reflex save catch on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage each round until
    the flames are extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action
    that requires a DC 20 Reflex save.</p>
