  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian is surrounded by an aura of howling winds.
      Creatures attempting to cast spells while adjacent to the barbarian must
      succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level), and ranged attack
      rolls against the barbarian take a –4 penalty. Creatures smaller than the
      barbarian that attack the barbarian in melee with a natural weapon or
      touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s
      level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier) or the attack fails and the
      creature is flung back 5 feet and knocked prone. The barbarian can suspend
      this aura as a free action.</p>
