  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the barbarian rages, enemies find it difficult to escape the
      vortex of her fury. As a full-round action while raging, the barbarian can
      attempt a single combat maneuver check against each creature within 10
      feet of her. If her roll equals or exceeds a creatureâ€™s CMD, she moves
      that creature 5 feet closer to her. Once per day after attempting this
      maneuver, she can attack each adjacent creature as a free action as if
      using the @Compendium[pf1.feats.UnmST9BvRhxT4vq3]{Whirlwind Attack} feat.
      If she has the @Compendium[pf1.feats.UnmST9BvRhxT4vq3]{Whirlwind Attack}
      feat, she can also use it as a free action in this way one additional time
      per day.</p>
