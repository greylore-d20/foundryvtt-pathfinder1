  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You become so attuned to the common spirit shared by all living things
      that you can use it to communicate with allies. You may communicate with
      your allies for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level as
      if using @Compendium[pf1.spells.zuqlok69lapqc6lg]{Telepathic Bond}. You
      may designate a number of creatures as your ally equal to your Charisma
      modifier. Designating a creature is a standard action that requires a
      touch.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, you may use this bond to cast a touch spell on a
      designated ally once per day.</p>
