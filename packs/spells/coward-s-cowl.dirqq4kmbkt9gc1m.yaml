      <p>You imbue the target with a compulsion to avoid threats, enhancing its
      defensive instincts. So long as the affected creature  does not move
      closer to enemies during its turn, or moves at least 5 feet away from
      adjacent enemies, it gains a +1 morale bonus to its AC, and a +1 morale
      bonus on saves and on attack rolls made as readied actions and attacks of
      opportunity. Alternatively, if the affected creature does not close with
      its enemies, it can increase the DC of all spells it casts as part of a
      readied action by 1. If the subject of the spell willingly moves toward a
      threatening creature, the spell immediately ends.  While affected by
      coward's cowl, a creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against
      fear effects.</p>
