  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, a summoner can use his makerâ€™s call ability to swap
      locations with his eidolon. If it is larger than him, he can appear in any
      square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that
      was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not
      able.</p>
