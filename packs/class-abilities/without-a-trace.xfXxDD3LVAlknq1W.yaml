    value: >-
      <p>When the rogue successfully uses evasion or improved evasion to avoid
      taking damage, she can attempt to hide as an immediate action. The rogue
      attempts a Stealth check with a â€“20 penalty, but gains a +1 bonus on her
      check for every die of damage the avoided attack would have dealt. The
      rogue can attempt this check even while being observed, as long as she has
      cover or concealment or an ability that allows her to use the Stealth
      skill while being observed without cover or concealment.</p>
