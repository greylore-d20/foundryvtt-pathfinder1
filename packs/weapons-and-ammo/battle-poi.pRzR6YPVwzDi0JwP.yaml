  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This pair of arm-length chains has handles at one end and heavy
      fuel-soaked torch heads at the other. The weight of the poi is
      insufficient to deal physical damage, but the burning fuel deals fire
      damage. If you are proficient in battle poi, you are treated as if you
      have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for the purposes of making poi attacks.
      Poi can be extinguished by spending a full round action smothering them in
      sand or submerging them in water.</p>
