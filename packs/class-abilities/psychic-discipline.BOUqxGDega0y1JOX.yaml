  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Each psychic accesses and improves her mental powers through a
      particular method, such as rigorous study or attaining a particular mental
      state. This is called her psychic discipline. She gains additional spells
      known based on her selected discipline. The choice of discipline must be
      made at 1st level; once made, it can’t be changed. Each psychic discipline
      gives the psychic a number of discipline powers (at 1st, 5th, and 13th
      levels), and grants her additional spells known. In addition, the
      discipline determines which ability score the psychic uses for her phrenic
      pool and phrenic amplifications abilities. The DC of a saving throw
      against a psychic discipline ability equals 10 + 1/2 the psychic’s level +
      the psychic’s Intelligence modifier.<p>At 1st level, a psychic learns an
      additional spell determined by her discipline. She learns another
      additional spell at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, until
      learning the final one at 18th level. These spells are in addition to the
      number of spells given on Table 1–8. Spells learned from a discipline
      can’t be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
