      <p>You create a cloud of flame-resistant strands of adhesive
      <i>web</i>bing that billows and flows much like a <i>cloudkill</i> spell.
      The cloud moves away from you at a rate of 10 feet per round, rolling
      along the surface of the ground.  Figure out the cloud's new spread each
      round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from
      the point of origin where the caster cast the spell. Creatures trapped in
      the <i>web</i>bing remain trapped even after the cloud passes, but the
      area the cloud leaves behind does not count as difficult terrain.  Because
      the <i>web</i>bing is heavier than air, it sinks to the lowest level of
      the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. The cloud of
      <i>web</i>bing cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater. 
      The cloud otherwise acts like a <i>web</i> spell. A creature in the cloud
      at the start of its turn must save against the cloud or be affected. The
      <i>web</i>bing of this spell is flammable (see the <i>web</i> spell), but
      has fire resistance 5.</p>
