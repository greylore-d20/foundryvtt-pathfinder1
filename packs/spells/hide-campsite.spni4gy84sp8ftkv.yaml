  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You make the area around a campsite appear to be a thicket of untouched
    and forbidding foliage, or some other unwelcoming feature matching the
    surrounding terrain. Creatures outside the area cannot sense any activity
    going on inside the area- they cannot smell campfires or cooking food, they
    cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot
    even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those inside the area
    can see out normally. Once a creature steps into the area of the spell, it
    can see everything in and around the area normally.</p>
