  shortDescription: >-
    <p>With a sweep of your hand, you select a number of targets and the same
    number of suits of armor. The targets of this spell are immediately clad in
    the armor that you choose. The subjects of the spell must be capable of
    wearing the chosen armor, cannot be wearing other armor, and must be able to
    properly fit into the chosen armor. The chosen armor must be empty and
    cannot be currently worn by another creature (thus you cannot move armor
    from one wearer to another with this spell). Creatures armored with this
    spell are considered to have donned the armor properly.</p>
