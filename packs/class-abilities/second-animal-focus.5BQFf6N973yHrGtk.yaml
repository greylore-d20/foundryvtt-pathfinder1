  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she
      selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can
      assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the
      companion’s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the
      minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.<p>If the hunter’s animal
      companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion’s animal aspect
      to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects
      at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion’s
      aspects to herself, not both.</p>
