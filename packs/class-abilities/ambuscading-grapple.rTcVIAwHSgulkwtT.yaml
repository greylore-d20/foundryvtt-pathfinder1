    value: >-
      <p>When a character with this talent succeeds at a combat maneuver check
      to grapple an unaware opponent, she can immediately deal her sneak attack
      damage to the target. This counts as having hit with a sneak attack for
      the purpose of other abilities and talents.</p>
