      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Instead of a single hard ball, this ammunition is a bundle of large
      pellets, balls, or pieces of scrap metal, propelled a short distance by
      black powder and attacking all creatures and objects within an area. Both
      cannons and fiend's mouth cannons can fire this kind of ammunition.</p>

      <p>When such a siege engine fires this ammunition, it hits every creature
      and object within a <b>30-foot-cone burst</b>. The siege engine makes
      attack rolls against each creature and unattended object in the burst.</p>

      <h3>Mishap</h3>

      <p>It must miss every creature or target to misfire, and a misfire
      generates the normal effect. It deals its normal damage on a hit, but does
      not ignore the hardness of objects.</p>
