  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A wooden thorn the size of a javelin (appropriate for your size)
      appears in your open hand. You can wield this thorn as a javelin, and you
      are proficient in its use. Any creature struck by the javelin must succeed
      at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. If you throw the javelin,
      another one appears in your hand. Any javelin that leaves your grasp
      disappears at the end of your turn. Each javelin attack you make reduces
      the spell's remaining duration by 1 minute.</p><p>If an attack reduces the
      remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after that attack
      resolves.</p>
