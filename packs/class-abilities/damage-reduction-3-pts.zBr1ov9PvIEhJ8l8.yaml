  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon's body becomes resistant to harm, granting it damage
      reduction. Choose one alignment: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. The
      eidolon gains DR 5 that can be bypassed by weapons that possess the chosen
      alignment. The alignment must be opposite to one of the alignments
      possessed by the eidolon.</p>

      <p>At 12th level, this protection can be increased to DR 10 by spending 2
      additional evolution points.</p>

      <p>The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this
      evolution.</p>
