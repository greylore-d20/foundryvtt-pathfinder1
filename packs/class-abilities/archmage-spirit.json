      "value": "<p><em>An archmage spirit is a font of knowledge and arcane power.</em><br><br><strong>Spirit Bonus: </strong>When you channel an archmage, your spirit bonus applies on concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Seance Boon: </strong>Your damaging spells deal an additional 2 points of damage of the same type that they would normally deal to each target.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations: </strong>Arcane redoubts, areas of unusual magic, libraries, schools.</p>\n<p><strong>Influence Penalty: </strong>Your body begins to respond as if you were a frail, aged scholar. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, Constitution checks, attack rolls, and non-spell damage rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Taboos: </strong>Choose one: You eschew all faith in the divine, so you must not be the willing target of divine spells or abilities and you must attempt a Will saving throw against even harmless divine spells and abilities; you must not pass up the opportunity to learn something new and significant (a nontrivial piece of information with a Knowledge check of DC 20 or higher) when that opportunity is directly present; you must use your own magical solution to a challenge if you can, even if a mundane solution that would require fewer resources is available.</p>"
