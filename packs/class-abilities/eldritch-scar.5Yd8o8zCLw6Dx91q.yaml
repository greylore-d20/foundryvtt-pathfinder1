  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day when you damage a creature with a spell you cast, you may,
      as a swift action, cause your magic to leave an eldritch scar upon that
      creature. An eldritch scar appears as a normal scar, save that it flickers
      with faint radiance of a color of your choice. The next time that creature
      casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item, it
      triggers a primal magic event (see page 13) of a CR equal to your caster
      level. This causes the eldritch scar to vanish. A creature can be marked
      by only one eldritch scar at a time (a more powerful one replaces a weaker
      one). An eldritch scar fades automatically after 24 hours. It can be
      removed before that point via any effect capable of removing a curse (the
      curse’s level equals your caster level), but if an attempt to remove an
      eldritch scar fails, that attempt triggers a primal magic event—an event
      triggered this way does not cause the eldritch scar to fade.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
