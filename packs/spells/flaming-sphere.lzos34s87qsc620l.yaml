  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and
      burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this
      movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it
      enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals
      3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex
      save negates that damage. A <i>flaming sphere</i> rolls over barriers less
      than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and
      illuminates the same area as a torch would.</p><p>The sphere moves as long
      as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely
      stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would
      put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy,
      yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It
      cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A
      <i>flaming sphere</i> winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>
