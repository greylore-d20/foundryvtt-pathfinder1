      <p>These sacks each include a 20-foot-long rope, from which they may be
      easily suspended from a tree limb or similar anchor point. Placing
      foodstuffs or fragile materials in hanging sacks is often considered a
      basic precaution when camping in the wild, to prevent <em>bears</em> and
      other predators from rooting through the sack's contents.</p>
