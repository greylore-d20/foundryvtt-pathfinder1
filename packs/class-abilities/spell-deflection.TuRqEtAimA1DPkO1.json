In order to successfully counter the spell, you must make an unarmed attack roll. If the result of this attack roll is higher than 20 + the spellâ€™s caster level, the spell is negated with no effect.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, any spell you successfully negate is reflected back at the caster with the same ranged touch attack result.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 11th level before selecting this revelation.</p>"
