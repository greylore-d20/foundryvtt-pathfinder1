  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You strap a light steel shield to your forearm and grip it with your
      hand. A light steel shield’s weight lets you carry other items in that
      hand, although you cannot use weapons with it. Whether wooden or steel, a
      light shield offers the same basic protection and attack benefits, though
      the two varieties respond differently to some spells and effects (such as
      rusting grasp). A druid can use a light wooden shield, but not a light
      steel shield.<p>Shield Bash Attacks: You can bash an opponent with a light
      shield. See “light shield” on Table 1–5: Martial Weapons for the damage
      dealt by a shield bash with a light shield. Used this way, a light shield
      is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack
      rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a
      weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus
      on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with
      it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
