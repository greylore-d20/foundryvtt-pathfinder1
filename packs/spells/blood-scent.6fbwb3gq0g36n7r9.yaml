      <p>You greatly magnify the target's ability to smell the presence of
      blood. The target is considered to have the scent universal monster
      ability, but only for purposes of detecting and pinpointing injured
      creatures (below full hit points). Creatures below half their full hit
      points or suffering bleed damage are considered strong scents for this
      ability.  Orcs and any creature under the effects of rage gain a +2 morale
      bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures they can smell with
      this spell, or a +4 morale bonus if the target's blood counts as a strong
      scent.</p>
