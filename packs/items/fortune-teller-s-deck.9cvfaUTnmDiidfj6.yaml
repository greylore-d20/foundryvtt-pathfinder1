      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This deck of illustrated cards is used by those in tune with the spirit
      world to predict the future—and by charlatans to take money from the
      gullible. A common deck only has simple drawings on simple wooden plaques.
      A quality fortune-teller’s deck usually consists of wooden plaques with
      painted color images; it is suitable as a focus for the augury spell, and
      provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Profession (fortune-teller),
      Profession (medium), and similar Profession checks. A masterwork
      fortuneteller’s deck may be wood, ivory, or even metal, with painted or
      carved images, and is often highlighted with gold inlays or tiny gems; it
      has all the benefits of a quality deck, except it provides a +2
      circumstance bonus on the listed skill checks.</p>
