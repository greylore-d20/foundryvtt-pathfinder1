      <p>You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.joza8kAIiImrPft7]{Sleight
      of Hand} checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 wizard levels you
      have. In addition, you can cast
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.p8lm7khq3ynyif21]{mage hand} at will as a
      spell-like ability that uses your caster level. At 5th level, you can
      attempt Sleight of Hand checks against a target within 30 feet, though the
      skill check DC increases by 5, and any creature within line of sight of
      either you or the target can attempt an opposed
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.2h6hz5AkTDxKPFxr]{Perception}
      check to notice the attempt. At 10th level, you can attempt a Sleight of
      Hand check as a move action with only a â€“10 penalty. At 20th level,
      whenever you attempt a Sleight of Hand check, assume the roll resulted in
      a natural 20.</p>
