  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This one-handed weapon is similar to a nunchaku in that it consists of
      a pair of bars linked with heavy chain. However, a flindbar's bars are
      made of iron and are capped with a ring of spikes or studs. Since it's
      much heaver than a nunchaku, it is not a light weapon.</p>
