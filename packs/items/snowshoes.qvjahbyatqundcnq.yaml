      <p>These high-tension nets of rope or sinew in wooden frames which are
      lashed to the feet spread your weight across the snow, making you much
      less likely to break through the crust and rendering walking much easier.
      Snowshoes reduce the penalty for walking through heavy snow by 50%; for
      example, if moving through snow normally costs you 2 squares of movement
      per square traveled, snowshoes reduce this cost to 1.5 squares per square
      traveled.</p>
