  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target firearm suddenly fires of its own volition, even if it is
    unloaded, generating a recoil so great that the wielder or carrier of the
    firearm must scramble to hold onto it and becomes flat-footed until the
    start of his next turn. If the wielder is already flat-footed, he is instead
    knocked prone. If the firearm was loaded, that ammunition is wasted.</p>
