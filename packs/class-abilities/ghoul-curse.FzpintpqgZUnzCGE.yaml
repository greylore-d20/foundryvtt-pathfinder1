  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While your actual dietary needs don’t change, you crave the flesh of
      sentient creatures. You can only go without food for 12 hours before you
      begin to starve, and when you do starve, the DC of the Constitution check
      to avoid taking damage increases by 5. If you feed on fresh, raw flesh (no
      older than 1 hour) from a creature of your own race, you gain a +1 morale
      bonus on all saving throws for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, you add @Compendium[pf1.spells.5u43heihlrtuc58y]{Ghoul
      Touch} to your list of 2nd-level oracle spells known.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, you become immune to paralysis and disease.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, you gain the effects of heroes’ feast whenever you feed
      on the raw flesh of a sentient creature, and the effects of this heroes’
      feast double if the flesh you eat comes from a member of your own race
      (this effect applies no more often than once per day).</p>
