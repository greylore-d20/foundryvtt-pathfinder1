  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, once per day as an <em>immediate action</em> upon being
      reduced to one-quarter your maximum <em>hit points</em>, you can force the
      mechanical <em>swarm</em> living inside you to keep you alive. This
      ability functions like a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.u7y6niex9e7tbhyp]{Resurgent Transformation} spell
      using your <em>sorcerer</em> level as the <em>caster level</em>, except it
      is an extraordinary ability and cannot be dispelled.</p>

      <p>At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day (though using
      this ability twice in one 24-hour period entails a chance of system shock
      and death; see the spellâ€™s description for more details).</p>

      <p>At 20th level, you never die of system shock from using this
      ability.</p>
