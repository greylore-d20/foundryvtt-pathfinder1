      <p>All affected creatures are veiled with a commonplace appearance. This
      appearance varies based on the viewer, but is always an ordinary member of
      that viewer's race, ethnicity, or nationality. This familiarity grants a
      +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks attempted by affected targets against those
      not affected by the spell.  Creatures with an attitude of unfriendly or
      hostile toward an affected target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve
      the effect the first time they encounter that target.</p>
