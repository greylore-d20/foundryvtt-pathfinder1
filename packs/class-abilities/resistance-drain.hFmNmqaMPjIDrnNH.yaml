  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the arcanist is using the spell resistance exploit, she can
      end the effect as an immediate action whenever her spell resistance
      successfully protects her from a spell cast by a foe. If she does so, she
      adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of
      the spell. These points are temporary and are lost after 1 minute unless
      used. Points gained in excess of her arcane reservoirâ€™s maximum are
      lost.</p>

      <p>The arcanist must have the greater spell resistance exploit to select
      this exploit.</p>
