  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can create a wall of swirling ashes anywhere within
      100 feet. This wall is up to 20 feet high and up to 10 feet long per
      cleric level you possess. The wall of ash blocks line of sight, and any
      creature passing through it must make a Fortitude save or be blinded for
      1d4 rounds. The wall of ash reveals invisible creatures that are inside it
      or adjacent to it, although they become invisible again if they move away
      from the wall. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day
      equal to your cleric level, but these minutes do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Fire Resistance power of the Fire Domain.</p>
