      <p>You create a shallow extradimensional hole perfectly sized to trip
      anyone who steps within it. This hole occupies a single 5-foot square with
      a depth of six inches. Any creature occupying the square when you first
      create the hole, or who later steps into the square containing the hole,
      must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling prone in an adjacent
      square and taking 1d6 points of damage. A creature that makes its saving
      throw still stumbles ever so slightly and takes a -1 penalty on all rolls
      and checks for 1 round. The spell has no effect on creatures adjacent to
      the square containing the hole.</p>
