      "value": "<p>When the barbarian rages, enemies find it difficult to escape the vortex of her fury. As a full-round action while raging, the barbarian can attempt a single combat maneuver check against each creature within 10 feet of her. If her roll equals or exceeds a creatureâ€™s CMD, she moves that creature 5 feet closer to her. Once per day after attempting this maneuver, she can attack each adjacent creature as a free action as if using the @Compendium[pf1.feats.UnmST9BvRhxT4vq3]{Whirlwind Attack} feat. If she has the @Compendium[pf1.feats.UnmST9BvRhxT4vq3]{Whirlwind Attack} feat, she can also use it as a free action in this way one additional time per day.</p>"
