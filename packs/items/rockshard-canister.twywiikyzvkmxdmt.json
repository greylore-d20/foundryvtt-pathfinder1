      "value": "<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO9468</em></p>\n<p><b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 25 lbs.</p>\n<p>Two separate compartments make up this black glass canister the size of a helmet. The large lower compartment contains hundreds of jagged shards of obsidian. The upper airtight chamber contains a sticky resin that hardens immediately upon contact with air. When you strike the canister with a bludgeoning melee weapon as a <em>standard action</em>, both compartments <em>shatter</em>, causing the obsidian shards to adhere to the weapon.</p>\n<p>The weapon deals piercing damage rather than bludgeoning damage for 10 minutes, at which point the resin dries and the shards fall off, or until you roll a natural 1 on an <em>attack roll</em>, which causes the shards to break off prematurely. If the weapon is made of a special material, the special properties of its material are suppressed while the obsidian shards adhere to the weapon.</p>\n<p>If you use a rockshard canister to coat an <em>unarmed strike</em> or <em>natural weapon</em>, you take 2d6 points of piercing damage when shattering the canister to apply the shards. For unarmed attacks, this can be avoided by carefully applying thick leather or <em>rope</em> straps to your hands and feet, which requires 5 minutes of work, prior to smashing the canister.</p>"
