      <p>While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their
      time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort
      dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers,
      swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are
      skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a
      battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering
      banner. The cavalier’s true power comes from the conviction of his ideals,
      the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using
      their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight.
      Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing their cause through
      diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The cavalier is no stranger to
      courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most delicate of social
      situations.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Dice</b>: d10.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>
