  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch
      a weapon to grant it an enhancement bonus. The bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for
      every 6 occultist levels you possess (to a maximum of +4 at 18th level).
      Enhancement bonuses gained by this ability stack with those of the weapon,
      to a maximum of +5.</p>

      <p>You can also imbue the weapon with any one weapon special ability with
      an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to your maximum bonus
      by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount. The
      item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (from the item itself
      or from legacy weapon) to gain a weapon special ability. In either case,
      these bonuses last for 1 minute.</p>
