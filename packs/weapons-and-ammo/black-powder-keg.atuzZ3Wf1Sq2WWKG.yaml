      <p><b>Source</b> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</em>, <em>Ultimate Combat
      pg. 140</em></p><h3>Description</h3><p>Black powder is the key explosive
      component within a firearm that enables it to function, but in larger
      amounts this alchemical material can be quite destructive on its own as
      well. A single dose of black powder is enough to power a single shot from
      most one-handed and two-handed firearms, while 10 doses are required to
      fire a cannon. Black powder is often stored and transported in kegs (which
      hold 100 doses), but in this quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous.
      Exposure to fire, electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder
      to explode-a single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of
      fire damage to anyone within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing
      black powder in a powder horn protects the powder from explosion.</p>
