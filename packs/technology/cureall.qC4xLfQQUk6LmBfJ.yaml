    value: >-
      <p>A dose of cureall allows the target to attempt an additional saving
      throw against a single disease or poison effect currently afflicting him.
      This additional saving throw counts for the total number of successful
      saves needed to recover from the disease or poison. If the target is
      suffering from multiple afflictions, a single dose of cureall works
      against only the effect with the highest save DC currently afflicting
      him.</p><p>Cureall also restores 1d4 points of ability damage or 1 point
      of ability drain that has been inflicted by a disease or poison, even if
      the user doesn't succeed at the save. A dose cures any ability drain
      before curing ability damage. If the target is suffering from drain or
      damage to multiple ability scores, the cureall cures the score with the
      most damage or drain (or randomly selects one if multiple scores have
      equal drain or damage).</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong>
