Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, it pushes the target of the attack 5 feet directly away from it. This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures pushed in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural attack.</p>"
