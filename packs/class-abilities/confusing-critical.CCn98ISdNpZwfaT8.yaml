  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, fey power courses through your attacks. Each time you
      confirm a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw or
      be confused for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your
      bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. This is a mind-affecting
      compulsion effect.</p>
