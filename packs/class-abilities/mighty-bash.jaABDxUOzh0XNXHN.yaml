  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, the cavalier does not provoke attacks of opportunity when
      she attacks foes while unarmed so long as she is dealing nonlethal damage.
      In addition, the cavalierâ€™s unarmed strikes deal more nonlethal damage
      than usual; she is treated as having a number of <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Monk">monk levels</a>
      equal to her cavalier level for the purpose of determining how much
      nonlethal damage her unarmed strikes deal. For example, a 12th-level
      cavalier of the order of the hammer would deal 2d6 points of nonlethal
      damage with her unarmed strike. The cavalier must still select the
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed Strike} feat if
      she wants to deal lethal damage with her unarmed strike, and lethal damage
      dealt with her unarmed strike is not increased by this ability.</p>
