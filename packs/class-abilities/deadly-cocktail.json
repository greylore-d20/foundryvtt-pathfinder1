These can be separate poisons, in which case they both affect the target individually, or two doses of the same toxin, in which case the poisonsâ€™ frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This talent is an exception to the rule that injury poisons can only be delivered one dose at a time.</p>"
