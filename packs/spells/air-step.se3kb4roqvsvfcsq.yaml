      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.e4v1uv8hexeu9sxj]{air walk}, except you
      can rise no higher than 1 foot off the ground, you cannot pass over
      liquid, and the air you walk on is less stable than solid ground. When
      walking on air, you ignore difficult terrain that is less than 1 foot
      high, you do not trigger effects based on weight (such as a pressure
      plate), and any creature trying to track you through areas you crossed
      with this spell takes a -10 penalty on its Perception or Survival check to
      do so. However, because of the instability of the air you walk on, your
      speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and you take a -4
      penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Ride checks.</p><p>If you have 1 rank in
      Fly, your speed is not reduced when using this spell, and you can cross
      over liquid at half speed.</p><p>If you have 5 ranks in Fly, you can cross
      liquid at full speed and do not take the penalties to your skill
      checks.</p>
