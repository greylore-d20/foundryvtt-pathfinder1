    <p>You whisper a single word in the primordial language of good that is
    anathema to the minions of evil and strengthens the resolve of good
    creatures. Evil creatures within the burst must make a Fortitude saving
    throw or become sickened for 1 round/level. Evil outsiders with the evil
    subtype, evil-aligned dragons, and undead in the burst also take 2d8 points
    of damage if they fail their saves. Good-aligned creatures in the burst gain
    a +2 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 round.</p>
