  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You greatly speed up the decomposition process of a nearby corpse and
    warp the fibers of time that permeate it, aging the corpse an additional
    amount of time equal to up to 1 day per 2 caster levels (maximum 10 days at
    20th level). This spell prompts all the natural effects of the intended
    decomposition period, including crumbled clothing, rotted or liquefied
    flesh, maggot infestations, and the infiltration of any surrounding
    vegetation.  In addition to hindering mundane autopsies and investigations,
    this spell may effectively prohibit the use of <i>raise dead</i> on the
    target, though more powerful magic such as <i>resurrection</i> or true
    <i>resurrection</i> may still work.</p>
