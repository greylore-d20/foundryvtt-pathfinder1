  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An alchemically fired piston in the head of this two-handed hammer
      strikes targets with astounding force. Successful sunder attacks made with
      a piston maul deal an additional 4 points of damage. A piston maul
      requires a thunderstone to function; otherwise, it functions as a
      greatclub. Inserting a thunderstone into the weapon's compartment is a
      standard action, and powers the weapon for 24 hours, after which the
      thunderstone is consumed.</p>
