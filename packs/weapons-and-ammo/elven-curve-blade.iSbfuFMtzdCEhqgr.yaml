  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade,
      the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare. You receive a +2 circumstance
      bonus to your CMD whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade
      because of its flexible metal.</p><p>You can use the Weapon Finesse feat
      to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on
      attack rolls with an elven curve blade that is sized for you, even though
      it isn't a light weapon.</p>
