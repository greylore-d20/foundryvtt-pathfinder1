  shortDescription: >-
    <p><i>Mind fog</i> produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental
    resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the <i>mind fog</i> take a
    -10 penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves. (A creature that successfully
    saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even
    if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as
    they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary
    and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).</p><p>A moderate wind
    (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses
    the fog in 1 round.</p><p>The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper
    vision.</p>
