  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you dance, act like a buffoon, or commit some
      other act of whimsy. When you do, enemies within 30 feet of you that can
      see and hear you must succeed a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your
      cleric level + half your Wisdom modifier) or they collapse into gales of
      manic laughter, falling prone. Those who fail their saving throws can take
      no actions other than laughing for 1 round, but are not considered
      helpless. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one
      additional time for every 4 levels you possess beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Chaos Blade power of the Chaos Domain.</p>
