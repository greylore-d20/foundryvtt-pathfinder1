  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, creatures of the animal or plant types donâ€™t attack you
      unless compelled to do so by magic or you attack them first. Three times
      per day, you can transport yourself from one tree to another tree, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.6x6epf4g5wgzl1gh]{Tree Stride} with half the
      transport range. Moving from one tree to another in this manner is a move
      action. You gain these abilities even while not bloodraging.</p>
