  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.d6lfhyonb3ewpjt4]{secret chest}, except
      the coffer is only 1 foot square and can contain only 1 cubic foot of
      goods, and the container can remain safely hidden on the Ethereal Plane
      for only 14 days before it risks becoming lost. The spell automatically
      fails if a living creature enters the coffer. The coffer used as a focus
      for <em>secret coffer</em> must cost at least 500 gp, and its replica
      costs 5 gp.</p>
