      <p>This spell changes the appearance of the affected creature so that it
      better blends in with its surroundings. As chosen by you, the affected
      creature takes on the appearance of a statue, furniture, a tree, a bush, a
      rock, or another object of similar size. As long as the target stays
      still, it gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks, and it can use Stealth even
      if it is being observed. The target's armor blends in perfectly with the
      illusory shape, and the target's armor check penalty on Stealth checks is
      negated for the duration of the spell. If the target moves at all while
      this spell is in effect, the spell ends.</p>
