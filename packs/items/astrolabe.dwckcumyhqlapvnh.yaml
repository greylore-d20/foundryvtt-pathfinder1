      <p>This device consists of a flat disc upon which two other discs are
      mounted. The mounted discs can rotate on a central axis, allowing them to
      spin and move as days pass. The bottom disc represents the latitude of the
      user; an <em>astrolabe</em> is useless if the user is outside the preset
      latitude. The upper disc represents the sky, and is filled with
      astronomical features. Anyone can be shown how to use an
      <em>astrolabe</em> at night to determine the date and time (which takes 1
      minute). When using an <em>astrolabe</em>, you can make a Survival check
      using your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier
      to avoid becoming lost.</p>
