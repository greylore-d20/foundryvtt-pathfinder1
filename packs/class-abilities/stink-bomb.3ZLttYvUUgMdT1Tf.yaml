        <p><em>Stinking cloud</em> creates a bank of fog like that created by
        <em>fog cloud</em>, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living
        creatures in the cloud become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as
        the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it
        leaves.</p><p>(Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Any
        creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must
        continue to save each round on your turn. This is a poison effect.</p>

      instead of @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud}, filling an
      area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist
