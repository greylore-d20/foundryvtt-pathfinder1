    value: >-
      <p><em>You can build technological weapons and
      armor.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.1foaZv9wfqZVrZ90]{Technologist}, Craft
      (mechanical) 7 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 7
      ranks</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You can create technological
      weapons or armor. Creating a technological weapon or suit of armor takes 1
      day for every 1,000 gp in the item's price. To create the object, you must
      use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See Crafting
      High-Tech Items on page 16 for more information.</p><p>You can also repair
      a broken technological weapon or suit of armor if it is one that you could
      make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would
      take to craft that item from scratch.</p>
