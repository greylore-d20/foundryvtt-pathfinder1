    value: >-
      <p>When the barbarian adopts this stance, she chooses an energy type
      (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). Her melee attacks deal 1 additional
      point of damage of the chosen type. This damage increases to 1d6 points at
      8th level. At 12th level, the barbarian’s critical hits deal an additional
      1d10 points of energy damage of the same type (2d10 if the weapon deals ×3
      damage on a critical hit, 3d10 if the weapon deals ×4 damage on a critical
      hit). This is a stance rage power. A barbarian must be at least 4th level
      to select this rage power.</p><hr><p><span class="notImp">This buff acts
