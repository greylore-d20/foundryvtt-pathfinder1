      <p><b>Footprints Cast (ACG)</b> This quick-drying cast is perfect for
      preserving a set of footprints in order to examine them later. By spending
      1 minute setting the cast and waiting for it to dry, you can copy
      footprints, allowing others to examine them without traveling to the
      scene, and preventing the DC of the <em>Survival</em> check to analyze
      them from increasing because of time or weather. <b>Price</b> 2 gp;
      <b>Weight</b> 1 lb. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1129</em></p>
