The belts contain hinged links to which the wearer can affix various objects such as tools, small weapons, and other valuables, including links of silver and platinum, or small hammered plates of gold set with gems. If worn properly, the belt can hold up to 30 pounds of small items. A swimming <em>undine</em> can unwrap the belt as <em>swift action</em> if she needs to remove it to decrease her weight load.</p>"
