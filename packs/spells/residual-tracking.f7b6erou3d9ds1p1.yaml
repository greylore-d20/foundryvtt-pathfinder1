  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By touching a footprint, you receive a clear mental image of the person
      or creature that made it. The image has the exact same appearance as the
      creature that made the footprint at the moment it made the imprint,
      including any telling features or expressions, any gear or equipment, or
      anything else the creature was carrying at the time. For example, the
      footprint of a horse would reveal both the horse and any creature riding
      it when it made the footprint.</p>
