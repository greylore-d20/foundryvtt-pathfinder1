    value: >-
      <p>You cause the target's mind to unleash a vast overflowing torrent of
      information throughout the target's body, causing the target's synapses to
      violently trigger. The target takes 1d6 points of electrical damage per
      caster level (maximum 15d6) and is staggered for 1 minute. A successful
      Fortitude saving throw doesn't reduce the damage, but it negates the
      staggered effect.</p>
