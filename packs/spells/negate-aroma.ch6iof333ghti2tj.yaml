      <p>With a gesture, this spell allows you to dismiss even the foulest or
      most distinctive scents. When cast, the targeted creatures or objects lose
      all natural and unnatural odors. A creature under the effect of <i>negate
      aroma</i> cannot be tracked, located, or pinpointed by the scent special
      quality. In addition, this spell prevents the target creature from using
      the stench special ability and similar odor-based abilities (such as those
      possessed by troglodytes).</p><p><i>Negate aroma</i> does not prevent the
      target from acquiring outside smells or odors. Dowsing the creature with a
      pungent substance effectively negates the benefits of the spell until the
      substance is neutralized or washed away.</p>
