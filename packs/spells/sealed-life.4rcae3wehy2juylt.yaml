  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You seal the life force within the target, preventing it from sharing
      its vitality with others. Affected creatures can't transfer damage to or
      from another, such as through <i>shield other</i>, a spiritualist's life
      bond, or a summoner's life link. Effects such as <i>vampiric touch</i>
      that steal vitality from others deal damage normally, but provide no
      benefits.</p>
