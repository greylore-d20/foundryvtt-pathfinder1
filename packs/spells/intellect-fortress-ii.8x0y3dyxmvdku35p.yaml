      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.twthnjx7cnvfzez2]{intellect fortress I},
      but in addition, any mind-affecting effects that deal damage have their
      damage reduced by half (before any reduction due to a successful save or
      other effect). This applies to both hit point damage and ability score
      damage. This spell can be undercast.</p>
