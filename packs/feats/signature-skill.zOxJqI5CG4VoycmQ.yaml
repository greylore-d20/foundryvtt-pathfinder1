      <p><b>Source</b> Pathfinder Unchained pg. 82</p><p><em>Your ability with a
      particular skill is the stuff of legends, and you can do things with that
      skill that others cannot.</em></p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: 5 ranks in the
      chosen skill.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Choose one skill. You gain the ability
      listed in that skill’s 5 Ranks entry. As you gain more ranks in the chosen
      skill, you gain additional abilities. If you have 10 or more ranks in the
      chosen skill, you gain the appropriate abilities immediately. If your
      chosen skill is Craft, Knowledge, Perform, or Profession, you gain the
      listed powers only for one category of that skill, such as Craft (bows).
      This feat can be taken only once, but it stacks with the rogue’s edge
      ability and the cutting edge rogue talent.</p>
