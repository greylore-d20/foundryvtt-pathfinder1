  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell blesses an area with positive energy. The DC to resist
      positive channeled energy within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every
      undead creature entering a <i>consecrate</i>d area suffers minor
      disruption, suffering a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and
      saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a
      <i>consecrate</i>d area. If the <i>consecrate</i>d area contains an altar,
      shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or
      aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred
      bonus to positive channeled energy DCs, -2 penalties for undead in the
      area).</p><p>You cannot <i>consecrate</i> an area with a similar fixture
      of a deity other than your own patron. Instead, the <i>consecrate</i>
      spell curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated
      deity or power.</p><p>This secondary function, if used, does not also
      grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given
      above.</p><p><i>Consecrate</i> counters and dispels <i>desecrate</i>.</p>
