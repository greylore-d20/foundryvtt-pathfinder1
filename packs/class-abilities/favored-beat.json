      "value": "<p>The investigator is familiar with a specific community in which she gains the benefits of renown. She gains the @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.6xRCEzFhje8h3fb6]{Renown} vigilante social talent (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 12). This community can be an entire settlement or portions of a settlement (such as a particular district or neighborhood) depending on the population, as allowed by the renown social talent. Anytime she could select another investigator talent, the investigator can also select from the following list of social talents (from pages 10â€“13 of Ultimate Intrigue), using her investigator level as her vigilante level for the purposes of meeting prerequisites: @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.Zu3Amhv4wWbqHr8f]{Celebrity Discount}, @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.YlQrG9WeIKOsviud]{Celebrity Perks}, @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.tZgzLbbc4fkdhQUH]{Gossip Collector}, @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.Z76OgmEJuaUZtHdV]{Great Renown}, @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.9kMoMFT33197l6fD]{Incredible Renown}, and @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.GjlhYlp5qLXZ5U0b]{Loyal Aid}.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of vigilante social talents, the investigator does not have a vigilante identity and is always considered to be in her social identity.</p>"
