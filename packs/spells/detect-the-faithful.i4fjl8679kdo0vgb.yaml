    value: >-
      <p>You can detect other worshipers of your deity (mortal worshipers,
      outsider servants, and so on). The amount of information revealed depends
      on how long you focus on a particular area or subject.</p><ul><li><p>1st
      Round: Presence or absence of the faithful.</p></li><li><p>2nd Round:
      Number of individual faithful in the area.</p></li><li><p>3rd Round: The
      exact location of each worshiper. If a fellow worshiper is outside your
      line of sight, then you discern his direction but not his exact
      location.</p></li></ul><p>Each round, you can rotate to detect worshipers
      in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but a sheet of lead, 1
      foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks
      it. A creature’s personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether
      or not it is of the same faith as you—hence heretics and splinter cultists
      of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. Furthermore, since
      the spell picks up a creature’s current beliefs and feelings, a creature
      actively pretending to be a member of the same faith also appears to the
      spell to be a member. Thus, the spell is still useful in locating
      potential hidden members of the same faith among the general populace, but
      on its own, it doesn’t weed out spies.</p>
