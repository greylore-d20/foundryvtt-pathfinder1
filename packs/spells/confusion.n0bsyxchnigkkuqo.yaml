  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell causes confusion in the targets, making them unable to
    determine their actions. Roll on the following table at the start of each
    subject's turn each round to see what it does in that
    round.</p><table><tr><th>d%</th><th>Behavior</th></tr>
    <tr><td>01-25</td><td>Act normally</td></tr> <tr><td>26-50</td><td>Do
    nothing but babble incoherently</td></tr> <tr><td>51-75</td><td>Deal 1d8
    points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand</td></tr>
    <tr><td>76-100</td><td>Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar
    counts as part of the subject's self)</td></tr></table> A confused character
    who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble
    incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a
    confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically
    attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when
    its turn comes. Note that a confused character will not make attacks of
    opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking
    (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been
    attacked).</p>
