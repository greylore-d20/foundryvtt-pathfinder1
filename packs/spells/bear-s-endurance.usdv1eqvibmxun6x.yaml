      <p>The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell
      grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the
      usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so
      forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are
      not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution
      drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points
      are.</p>
