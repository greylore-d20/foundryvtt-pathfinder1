    value: >-
      <p>You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but the
      spell doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning
      animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones
      make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some
      favor or service for you.</p>
