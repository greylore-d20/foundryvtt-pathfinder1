      <p>This spell functions similarly to <i>plane shift</i>, but instead of
      transporting the targets to a destination near an intended location on a
      specific plane, <i>Anywhere but Here</i> transports affected creatures to
      a random plane. A creature can be affected by <i>Anywhere but Here</i>
      only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets can, by
      chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell).
      Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but
      the exact destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is
      determined by the table below; the location on the destination plane where
      the transported creatures arrive is completely subject to the GM's whim.

      <i>Anywhere but Here</i> cannot be affected by a subsequent casting of
      <i>Anywhere but Here</i> for 24 hours afterward (but can be affected
      normally by other forms of planar travel).<p></p>
