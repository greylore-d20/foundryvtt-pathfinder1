    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the target is affected by a spell or effect that heals hit
      point damage through the use of positive or negative energy, it regains
      only half the number of hit points it normally would recover. If the
      target employs a spell or effect that heals itself or other creatures
      through the use of positive or negative energy, the target must succeed at
      a concentration check (DC = this spell's save DC) or the effect restores
      only half of the normal number of hit points. Other forms of healing (such
      as from the Heal skill) are not affected by this spell.</p>
