  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of destruction for a number
      of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All attacks made against
      targets in this aura (including you) gain a morale bonus on damage equal
      to 1/2 your cleric level and all critical threats are automatically
      confirmed. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
