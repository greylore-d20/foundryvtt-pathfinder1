      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>These iron bolts have small resin tips that break when the bolts strike
      their targets. Inside is a dose of drow poison.</p>

      <p>Anyone struck by a drow poison bolt must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or
      fall unconscious for 1 minute. After 1 minute, the subject must succeed on
      another DC 13 Fortitude save or remain unconscious for 2d4 hours.</p>

      <p>Those using drow poison bolts do not risk poisoning themselves, but the
      strange tip affects the bolts' accuracy. Double the range penalties when
      using a drow poison bolt.</p>
