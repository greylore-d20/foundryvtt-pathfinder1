      <p>The target of this spell causes several conditions that he suffers from
      to be lessened in severity one step. If he is nauseated, he is instead
      sickened. If he is stunned, he is instead dazed. If he is exhausted, he is
      fatigued. If he is frightened, he is shaken. If he is paralyzed, he is
      staggered. The duration of the effect is unchanged; the effect is simply
      reduced to the lesser version. This spell has no effect on conditions not
      listed above.</p>
