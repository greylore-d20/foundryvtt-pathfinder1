  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch surrounds her target with oppressive heat, dealing a number
      of points of nonlethal damage equal to her witch level and causing the
      target to become fatigued. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to
      reduce this nonlethal damage by half and negate the fatigued
      condition.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the target succeeds at this save, it canâ€™t be the target
      of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
