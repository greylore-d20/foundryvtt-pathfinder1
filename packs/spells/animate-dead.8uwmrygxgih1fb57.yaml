  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell turns corpses into undead skeletons or zombies (see the
    <i>Pathfinder RPG</i> Bestiary) that obey your spoken commands.</p><p>The
    undead can be made to follow you, or they can be made to remain in an area
    and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the
    place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed skeleton
    or zombie can't be animated again.</p><p>Regardless of the type of undead
    you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice
    your caster level with a single casting of <i>animate dead</i>. The
    <i>desecrate</i> spell doubles this limit.</p><p>The undead you create
    remain under your control indefinitely.</p><p>No matter how many times you
    use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures
    per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures
    fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become
    uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Undead you control
    through the Command Undead feat do not count toward this
    limit.</p><p><i>Skeletons</i>: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly
    intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made
    from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.</p><p><i>Zombies</i>: A zombie
    can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.</p><p>The corpse must be
    that of a creature with a physical anatomy.</p>
