  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can unleash a furious call to the heavens, summoning
      forth an ever-changing storm of destruction for a number of rounds per day
      equal to your cleric level. This storm has a radius of 5 feet per cleric
      level. Each round, the storm has one of the following effects: driving
      rain (–4 on all Perception checks and ranged attack rolls), howling winds
      (–8 on Fly skill checks and ranged attack rolls), heavy snow (all terrain
      is considered difficult), or lightning bolt (as call lightning). Other
      effects depending on the weather might also apply (at the GM’s
      discretion). You choose which effect takes place each round, but no effect
      may be repeated on the following round. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Destructive Aura power of the Destruction
      Domain.</p>
