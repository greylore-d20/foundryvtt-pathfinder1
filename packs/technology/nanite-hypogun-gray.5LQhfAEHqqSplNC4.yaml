      effectNotes:
        - >-
          You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. If
          the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 +
          caster level) against the DC of each poison affecting the target.
          Success means that the poison is neutralized. A cured creature suffers
          no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are
          ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as
          hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go
          away on their own.  This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a
          poisonous creature or object for 10 minutes per level, at the caster's
          option.  If cast on a creature, the creature receives a Will save to
          negate the effect.

      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      none</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> 1 nanite canister;
      <strong>Usage</strong> 1 charge or 5
      charges</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Nanite hypoguns inject specialized
      nanites into a creature's body to heal many sorts of physical and mental
      injuries. Injecting someone with a nanite hypogun requires a touch attack.
      Nine categories of nanite hypogun exist along the color code scale, as
      detailed below. All nanite hypoguns have two settings. On the primary
      setting, the hypogun heals an amount of hit point damage determined by its
      color. Each use of a hypogun on its primary setting consumes 1 charge. On
      the secondary setting, a dose from a nanite hypogun has a different effect
      determined by its color-these effects mimic specific restorative spells as
      indicated on the chart below. Each use of a hypogun on its secondary
      setting consumes 5 charges. Although they are not magical, nanite hypoguns
      have an effective caster level for the purposes of determining the potency
      of their effects as required by special circumstances (such as determining
      if a disease is cured, or if damage caused by a clay golem's cursed wound
      ability can be healed).</p><p>A nanite hypogun functions only on a living,
      corporeal creature. It has no effect on undead creatures
      whatsoever.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Primary
