      <p>Tents come in a variety of sizes and accommodate between one and 10
      people. Two Small creatures count as a Medium creature, and one Large
      creature counts as two Medium creatures. Packing up a tent takes half as
      long as assembling it.</p><p><strong>Small/Normal</strong>: A small tent
      holds one Medium creature and takes 20 minutes to
      assemble.</p><p><strong>Medium</strong>: A medium tent holds two creatures
      and takes 30 minutes to assemble.</p><p><strong>Large</strong>: A large
      tent holds four creatures and takes 45 minutes to
      assemble.</p><p><strong>Pavilion</strong>: A huge open-air canopy, plus
      stakes, poles, and ropes. A pavilion holds 10 creatures and takes 90
      minutes to assemble. Pavilion tents are large enough to accommodate a
      small fire in the center.</p><p><strong>Hanging Tent</strong> A hanging
      tent is a small tent (able to comfortably house a single Medium creature)
      with a teardrop shape, which hangs from a sturdy anchor rope. The rope can
      be tied to a tree limb, grappling hook, or even a piton hammered into a
      cliff side. Hanging tents are used primarily in mountainous terrain (where
      no flat surface may be available for camping) and swamps (where no dry
      ground may be available). Climbing in or out of a hanging tent is a
      <em>full-round action</em> that requires a DC 10 <em>Climb</em> check.
      Failure indicates another attempt must be made, while failure by 5 or more
      indicates the camper has fallen from the tent. <strong>Source</strong>
