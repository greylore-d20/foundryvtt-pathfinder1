  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The magus can expend 1 or more points from his arcane pool as a swift
      action to empower his weapon with shadowy energy that dissipates within 1
      minute. A creature struck with the weapon must succeed at a Will save (DC
      = 1/2 the magusâ€™s level + his Intelligence modifier) or treat the magus as
      being in an area of dim light for 1d4 rounds, plus 1 additional round for
      each arcane pool point expended. True seeing penetrates this effect, but
      darkvision and similar darkness-penetrating effects do not.</p>

      <p>The magus must be at least 9th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
