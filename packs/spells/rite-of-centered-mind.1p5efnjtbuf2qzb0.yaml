  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You heighten your awareness of your own thoughts, allowing you to more
    easily resist outside influences. You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving
    throws to resist mind-affecting effects. This resistance bonus is increased
    to +2 if the effect is an emotion or fear effect. Additionally, at any time
    during the spell's duration, whenever you fail a saving throw to resist a
    mind-affecting effect, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as an
    immediate action in order to reroll that saving throw. You must take the
    second result, even if it's worse. The +2 resistance bonus granted by the
    spell applies to the reroll, but after you make this reroll, the spell
    ends.</p>
