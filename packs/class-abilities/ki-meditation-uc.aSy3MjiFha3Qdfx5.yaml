    value: >-
      <p>A monk with this ability can spend 2 ki points to meditate as a
      full-round action, as if using Combat Meditation.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, he can spend 4 ki points to meditate as a move action
      instead.</p>

      <p>Using these ki points does not count as one of the monkâ€™s daily uses of
      Combat Meditation, but it grants him the usual benefits he would gain from
      his meditation feats for doing so.</p>

      <p>The monk must have the Combat Meditation feat before selecting this ki
      power.</p>
