Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. A&nbsp;headband of vast intelligence&nbsp;has one skill associated with it per +2 bonus it grants. After being worn for 24 hours, the headband grants a number of skill ranks in those skills equal to the wearerâ€™s total&nbsp;<em>Hit Dice</em>. These ranks do not stack with the ranks a creature already possesses. These skills are chosen when the headband is created. If no skill is listed, the headband is assumed to grant skill ranks in randomly determined&nbsp;<em>Knowledge</em>&nbsp;skills.</p>",
