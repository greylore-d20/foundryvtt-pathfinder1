      <p>Each round, you concentrate on one target, who must be within range.
      You know if the target deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by
      discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying. The spell does not
      reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily
      reveal evasions.</p><p>Each round, you may concentrate on a different
      target.</p>
