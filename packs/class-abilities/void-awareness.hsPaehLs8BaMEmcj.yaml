      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Dragon Empires Primer pg. 29</p><p>Your
      ability to recognize the void allows your body to react to magical
      manifestations before youâ€™re even aware of them. You gain a +2 insight
      bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus
      increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. At 20th level,
      whenever you would be affected by a spell or spell-like ability that
      allows a saving throw, you can roll twice to save against the effect and
      take the better result.</p>
