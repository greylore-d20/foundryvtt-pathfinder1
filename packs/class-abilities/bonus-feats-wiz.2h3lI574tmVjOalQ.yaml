  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At
      each such opportunity, he can choose a <em>metamagic feat</em>, an
      <em>item creation</em>, or @Compendium[pf1.feats.KlE26ofz7uAkd0IJ]{Spell
      Mastery}. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat,
      including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the
      feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard
      is not limited to the categories of <em>Item Creation Feats</em>,
      <em>Metamagic Feats</em>, or @Compendium[pf1.feats.KlE26ofz7uAkd0IJ]{Spell
      Mastery} when choosing those feats.</p>

      <p>A wizard may also choose an <em>Arcane Discovery</em> that he qualifies
      for in place of a bonus feat at these levels.</p>
