      <p>The object becomes flawed and prone to failure. The effects of this
      spell depend on the nature of the object. <i>Magic Item</i>: The item
      functions intermittently, gaining either an unreliable curse or a random
      dependent curse (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 536). <i>Nonmagical
      Armor or Shield</i>: The item gains the fragile armor quality
      (<i>Pathfinder RPG <i>Ultimate Equipment</i></i> 8). <i>Nonmagical
      Weapon</i>: The item gains the fragile weapon quality (<i>Ultimate
      Equipment</i> 22). <i>Tool</i>: The item gains the broken condition if a
      creature rolls a natural 1 while making a skill check with the tool.
      <i>Other Item</i>: Each day it is used, the item has a 5% chance of
      gaining the broken condition.  This spell does not affect artifacts. The
      item can be sold or discarded as normal (the bearer is not compelled to
      keep it). If a cleric of Groetus is using an item that is affected by this
      spell, he or she may make a DC 20 Will saving throw to override the item's
      curse for 1 day (using it as if the item were not cursed).</p>
