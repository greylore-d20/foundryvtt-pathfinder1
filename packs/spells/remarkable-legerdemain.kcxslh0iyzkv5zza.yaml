  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While this spell is in effect, your body and clothing flutter and
      distort subtly, allowing you to conceal items with uncanny skill. You
      treat any object you can hold in one hand as a coin-sized object for the
      purposes of Sleight of Hand checks to palm the object or make it
      disappear; however, you can hide only one such item per caster level on
      your person at one time. This effect does not change the actual sizes of
      the objects.</p>
