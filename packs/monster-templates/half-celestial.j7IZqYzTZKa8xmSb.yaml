      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Both<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes<p>“Half-celestial” is an inherited or
      acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature with
      an Intelligence score of 4 or more. A half-celestial creature retains the
      base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted
      here.<p><b>CR:</b> HD 5 or less, as base creature + 1; HD 6–10, as base
      creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.<p><b>Alignment:</b> Any
      good.<p><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to outsider (native). Do
      not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor
      improves by +1.<p><b>Defenses/Qualities:</b> It gains darkvision 60 feet;
      immunity to disease; +4 racial bonus on saves vs. poison; acid, cold, and
      electricity resist 10; DR 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12
      or more); and SR equal to CR + 11 (maximum 35).<p><b>Speed:</b> Unless the
      base creature flies better, the half-celestial flies at twice the base
      creature's land speed (good maneuverability).<p><b>Special Abilities:</b>
      A half-celestial gains the following.<p><em>Smite Evil (Su):</em> Once per
      day as a swift action the half-celestial can smite evil as a paladin of
      the same level as its Hit Dice. The smite persists until the target is
      dead of the half-celestial rests.<p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> A
      half-celestial with an Int or Wis score of 8 or higher has a cumulative
      number of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice. Unless otherwise
      noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level equals the
      creature's HD (or the caster evel of the base creature's spell-like
      abilities, whichever is higher).</p>
