      "value": "<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>\n<p>Ifrit <em>alchemists</em> claim to make this thick red oil from their own blood-hence the morbid name-but this claim is almost certainly false. Ifrit's blood ignites upon contact with air, but burns slowly and is unsuitable for use as a <em>splash weapon</em>. A creature can apply a flask of ifrit's blood to a weapon as a <em>standard action</em>, wreathing the weapon in vibrant red flames for 1 minute. The oil deals 1 point of fire damage on each successful attack with the weapon and deals 1 point of fire damage to the weapon itself, bypassing the weapon's <em>hardness</em> if any part of it is made of wood. If the oil is applied to a creature's <em>natural weapons</em> or unarmed strikes, the creature takes 1 point of fire damage each round (though its fire <em>immunity</em> or <em>resistance</em> still applies).</p>"
