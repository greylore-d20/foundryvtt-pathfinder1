      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This twin-barreled shotgun can be shot one barrel at a time, or both
      together as one attack. A double shot that fires bullets is inaccurate,
      and takes a -4 penalty on both attacks.</p>

      <p>A double shot that fires bullets targets only a single creature and
      increases the damage of each barrel to 2d6 points (Small) or 2d8 points
      (Medium) for a total of 4d6 or 4d8 points of damage. A doublebarreled
      shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as
      ammunition.</p>
