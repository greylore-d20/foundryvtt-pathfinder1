  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell creates a special mystical connection between you and your
    companion creature-animal companion, bonded mount, eidolon, or
    familiar-which allows you to transfer its wounds to you. The creature gains
    a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves.</p><p>As an
    immediate action when your companion takes damage, you can take that damage
    yourself to prevent your companion from being harmed (similar to
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.menqakfoa1ftvi3f]{shield other}, except the damage is
    not split between you and the target). Forms of harm that do not involve the
    loss of hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level
    drain, and death effects, are not affected. If the creature suffers a
    reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, you cannot take
    that damage on behalf of your companion creature because it is not hit point
    damage. When the spell ends, damage directed to you by the spell is not
    reassigned to the subject.</p><p>If you and your companion move out of range
    of each other, the spell ends.</p>
