    value: >-
      <p>You grow a draconic tail (clothing and armor adjust as necessary), or
      if you already have a tail, it takes on a draconic appearance. If you have
      a draconic bloodline, the tail matches the appearance of that dragon type;
      otherwise, it matches the appearance of a dragon type whose alignment
      matches your own. You gain a tail slam attack that deals 1d6 points of
      damage (1d4 if Small, 1d8 if Large) + your Strength modifier. If you
      already have a tail attack, you instead extend the reach of your tail
      attack by 5 feet. If you have a tail sweep attack, this spell increases
      its radius by 10 feet.  If used as part of a full-attack action, the tail
      slam is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack
      bonus - 5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage. You can end
      this spell before its normal duration by uttering a bestial roar as a
      swift action. When you do, you can attempt an Intimidate check to
      demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the roar. 
      Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship dragon deities
      add <i>tail strike</i> to their class spell lists as a 4th-level
      spell.</p>
