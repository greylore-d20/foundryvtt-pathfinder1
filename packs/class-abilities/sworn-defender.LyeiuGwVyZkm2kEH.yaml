  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, the cavalier gains a +1 morale bonus on saving throws to
      resist effects created by creatures whose alignments are at least two
      steps away from his settlement’s alignment (e.g., a cavalier of a lawful
      good settlement and an opponent of neutral alignment). If the creature’s
      alignment is three or more steps away from his settlement’s alignment, the
      bonus increases to +2.</p>
