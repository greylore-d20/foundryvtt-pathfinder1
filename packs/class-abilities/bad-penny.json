The next bearer of the cursed coin takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws and skill checks as long he has the coin on his person. Once the coin leaves his person, the curse ends and the coin becomes a mundane piece of tender again.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the penalty becomes –4.</p>\n<p>If the shaman curses a new coin, the previous curse ends. This is a curse effect.</p>"
