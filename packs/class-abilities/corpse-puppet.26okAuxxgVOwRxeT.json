By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of your own sentience into the zombie, allowing it to persist for 1 round per kineticist level without requiring additional actions on your part, or until the next time your burn is removed if the zombie has half your maximum zombie Hit Dice or fewer.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, you can animate a zombie with a number of Hit Dice no greater than your kineticist level – 2.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, you can animate a zombie with a number of Hit Dice no greater than your kineticist level.</p>"
