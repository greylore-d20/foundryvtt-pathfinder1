  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can conceal or disguise her home and the area around it as if
      using mirage arcana. Before using the hex, she must spend 1 day pacing out
      the border of an area that measures roughly 40,000 square feet
      (approximately 200 feet by 200 feet) to define her home territory.
      Thereafter, she can use the hex to change the appearance of that area as a
      standard action as long as she is within the area. The illusion persists
      until the witch changes or dismisses it.</p>

      <p>For the purpose of this ability, a witch can only have one “home” at a
      time.</p>
