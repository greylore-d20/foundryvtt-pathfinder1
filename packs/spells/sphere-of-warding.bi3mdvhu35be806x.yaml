      <p>You create a luminescent sphere of orbiting energy that harms
      incorporeal creatures and dispossesses them of any stolen bodies. An
      incorporeal creature must succeed at a Will save to enter a space
      overlapping with the sphere; failure means the creature cannot pass
      through the sphere, as though it were a <i>Wall of Force</i>. If the
      incorporeal creature succeeds, it may pass through the sphere at will,
      though if it ends its turn within the sphere, it takes a number of points
      of force damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).</p><p>If
      a creature possessing another creature's body (via either <i>magic jar</i>
      or a similar effect) enters a <i>Sphere of Warding</i>, that creature is
      immediately ejected from its host body, the host's spirit returns to its
      body if it's able, and the possession immediately ends. When ejected, the
      body enters the sphere, while the possessing creature takes the
      appropriate amount of force damage (no save) and is shunted to the
      exterior of the sphere.</p>
