  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a rogue with this talent uses the powerful sneak talent, she
      rerolls all sneak attack dice that resulted in 1s or 2s. She can reroll
      multiple dice, but she canâ€™t reroll any individual die more than once per
      attack.</p>

      <p>A rogue must have the powerful sneak talent before selecting this
      talent.</p>
