      <p>As a standard action, you can create a 5-foot-radius cloud of acid
      vapor within 30 feet that lasts for 1 round. This cloud deals 1d6 points
      of acid damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all
      creatures in the cloud and sickens them for 1 round. A successful
      Fortitude save negates the sickened effect and halves the damage. The DC
      of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence
      modifier. Creatures that begin their turn inside the cloud can move out
      that turn without penalty, but those that enter the cloud are affected.
      You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Intelligence modifier.</p>
