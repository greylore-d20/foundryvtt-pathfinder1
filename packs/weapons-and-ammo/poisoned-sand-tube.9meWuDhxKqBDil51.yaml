      made of bamboo or metal, this tube is filled with fine sand that is soaked
      or coated with inhaled or contact poison. When loaded with 3 doses of
      these types of poison, you can blow into the tube to disperse the poisoned
      sand into your enemies' faces in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone
      is affected as if afflicted with 1 dose of the poison. Even when loaded
      with unpoisoned sand, the tube lets loose a powerful irritant, and an
      opponent struck must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw or be
      dazzled for 1 round. Once expended, the tube must be repacked before it
      can be used again. Repacking a tube requires a full-round action, or a
      standard action if you have the Rapid Reload feat.</p>
