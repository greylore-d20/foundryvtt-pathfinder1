  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Sneaks and thieves throughout Golarion know the value of a good
      disguise. The ability to remove that disguise in a hurry, thus revealing
      the next layer of disguise, is nearly as valuable. Tear-away clothing is
      generally loose fitting and long to allow another layer of clothing to be
      worn underneath. The seams and catches on this clothing are designed to
      break easily, making it a simple matter (a <em>standard action</em>) to
      remove these items and walk away with none the wiser.</p>
