      <p>This spell functions as <i>entangle</i>, except the plants also grow
      thorns and can fling them up to 15 feet. Any creature that moves within 15
      feet of the spell's area is attacked once on its turn by the animated
      plants. The plants use your caster level as their base attack bonus and
      add your spellability score modifier (Intelligence for witches; Wisdom for
      druids, rangers, and shamans) to the attack roll. A volley of thorns
      counts as a thrown weapon and deals 2d6 points of piercing damage on a
      successful hit. A creature that enters the spell's area or ends its turn
      there automatically takes 2d6 points of piercing damage.</p>
