  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can combine her magic with her poisons to weaken her enemies’
      minds. When the witch creates a poison, she can require the target of the
      poison to attempt a Will save rather than a Fortitude save.</p>

      <p>The witch must use this hex when she crafts the poison, and once used,
      the hex can’t be undone without remaking the poison.</p>
