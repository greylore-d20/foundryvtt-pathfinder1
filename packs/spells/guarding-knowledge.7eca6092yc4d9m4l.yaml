    value: >-
      <p>Upon casting this spell, choose a specific variety of monster (red
      dragon rather than dragon) and one of its special attacks that you have
      successfully identified with a Knowledge check or otherwise researched,
      such as a cockatrice's petrification ability or a spider swarm's poison.
      You gain a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against the selected special
      attack. The bonus does not apply to saves against other monsters'
      abilities of the same name, spell-like abilities, or special attacks
      derived from class levels or equipment. If you use a trophy from a monster
      of the exact same variety as an optional material component, the bonus
      increases to +6.</p>
