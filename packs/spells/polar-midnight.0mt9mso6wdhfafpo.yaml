  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You plunge an area into the brutal chill of the arctic
    night.</p><p>Illumination conditions are dropped by two steps (though only
    to darkness, not supernatural darkness), and all creatures in the area take
    5d6 points of cold damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage per round. A
    successful Fortitude save each round negates the Dexterity damage but not
    the cold damage.</p><p>Any creature that doesn't move on its turn becomes
    encased in a sheath of ice equivalent to <i>Wall of Ice</i>, is helpless,
    and cannot breathe. Corpses in the area for longer than 1 round are
    transmuted into solid ice; reviving the icy corpse requires <i>true
    resurrection</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. As a move action, you may
    move the area of effect up to 10 feet in any direction.</p>
