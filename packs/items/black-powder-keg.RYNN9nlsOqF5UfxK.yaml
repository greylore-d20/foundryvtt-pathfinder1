      <p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.trucdntfxjdukrox]{Black powder} is
      often stored and transported in kegs (which hold 100 doses), but in this
      quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous. Exposure to fire,
      electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder to explodeâ€”a
      single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of fire damage to
      anyone within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing black powder in
      a @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.PtMcbl9zBVnwn0mA]{powder horn} protects
      the powder from explosion.</p>
