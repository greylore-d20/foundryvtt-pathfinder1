  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, once per day as an <em>immediate action</em>, you can
      attune yourself to the Astral’s timeless nature to halt the effects of one
      condition or affliction (such as <em>paralyzed</em>, <em>stunned</em>, a
      <em>poison</em>, or a curse), including permanent and instantaneous
      conditions, until the end of your next turn. You can use this ability even
      when a condition or affliction would normally prevent you from doing so,
      regardless of whether you’re targeting that prevention effect’s source. At
      the end of your next turn the condition or affliction resumes its normal
      effect and the round delayed by this ability does not count toward the
      condition or affliction’s duration. This ability has no effect on hit
      point damage, <em>ability damage</em>, or the <em>dead</em> condition.
      Alternatively, you can use this ability to extend the duration of any one
      effect affecting you until the end of your next turn; this does not extend
      the duration for any other creatures under the effect. At 19th level, you
      can use this ability twice per day.</p>
