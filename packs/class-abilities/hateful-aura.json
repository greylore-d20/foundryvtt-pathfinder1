      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of hatred for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds need not be consecutive. Enemies within this aura must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier). Characters who fail their save are filled with hatred, and cannot consider other characters allies for the purpose of any actions or use any teamwork feats. The effect ends immediately if the creature leaves the aura, you end the aura as a free action, or you expend all rounds of this ability.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Destructive Aura power of the Destruction Domain.</p>"
