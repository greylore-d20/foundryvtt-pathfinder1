  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>resurrection</i> except that instead of
      recalling the dead soul to life, the spell calls a shadow demon with the
      advanced simple template (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 67, 294) to
      possess the body. If you fail to overcome the subject's spell resistance,
      the subject's soul can negate the calling and gain the option to return to
      life (as <i>resurrection</i>) in the restored body. The possession
      otherwise functions (as possessionOA) except that the subject's soul is
      not present to resist. When <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i> ends or the
      demon is removed from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving
      the body alive but soulless (like that created by clone). If the soul
      hasn't been returned to life already, it has the option to return in the
      now-empty body if it still lives (as <i>resurrection</i>). If the body was
      killed, the demon is sent back to the Abyss but the subject remains dead. 
      Attempts to identify <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i> with a skill check
      incorrectly identify it as <i>resurrection</i> (see the ruse descriptor on
      page 192). A fooled viewer mistakes <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i>'s
      aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.</p>
