      <p>The spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.nepwelwi6tlh1vo0]{mind swap}, except as
      noted above. In addition, after 24 hours, instead of using each other's
      hit points, you each revert to your original hit points, modified by your
      new Constitution modifiers. This spell can be reversed only with
      <em>miracle</em>, <em>wish</em>, or another major <em>mind swap</em>.</p>
