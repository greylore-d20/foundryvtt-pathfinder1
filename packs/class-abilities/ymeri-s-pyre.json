Each round that the barbarian rages reduces the duration of negative spells and effects inflicted upon her as if 2 rounds had passed; this has no effect on the duration of such effects against other creatures. Once per day, the barbarian can expend 5 rounds of rage to attempt a new saving throw against each nonpermanent effect currently affecting her. Each successful saving throw ends the related effect, and she can choose not to make a save against an effect.</p>"
