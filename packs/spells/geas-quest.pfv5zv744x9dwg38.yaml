  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions similarly to <i>lesser <i>geas,</i></i> except
      that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.</p><p>If
      the subject is prevented from obeying the <i>geas/quest</i> for 24 hours,
      it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -3
      penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can be reduced
      to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24
      hours after the subject resumes obeying the <i>geas/quest</i>.</p><p>A
      remove curse spell ends a <i>geas/quest</i> spell only if its caster level
      is at least two higher than your caster level. <i>Break enchantment</i>
      does not end a <i>geas/quest</i>, but limited <i>wish</i>, miracle, and
      <i>wish</i> do.</p><p>Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this
      spell as <i>geas,</i> while clerics call the same spell quest.</p>
