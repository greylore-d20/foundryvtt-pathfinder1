      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot-radius aura that grants your allies a +4 bonus on all saving throws against effects that inflict the fatigued or exhausted condition. Any equipment wielded by your allies within this area gets a bonus to hardness equal to 1/2 your cleric level, and your alliesâ€™ attacks against targets within this area ignore an equal amount of hardness. You can use this aura for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Dancing Weapon power of the Artifice Domain.</p>"
