      <p><strong>Source</strong> Spymaster's Handbook pg. 23</p><p>You are well
      acquainted with scrying sensors. You can roll twice and take the better
      result on saving throws against divination (scrying) spells and effects,
      on Perception checks to notice scrying sensors, and on caster level checks
      to overcome spell resistance when you use a scrying spell or effect. If
      you notice a magical sensor, you can attempt a Stealth check opposed by
      the casterâ€™s caster level check to avoid being detected by the sensor.</p>
