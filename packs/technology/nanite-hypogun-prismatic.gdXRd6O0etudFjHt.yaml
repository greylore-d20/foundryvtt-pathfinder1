            This spell functions like raise dead, except that you can resurrect
            a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster
            level.  This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have
            been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the
            deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of
            birth or death is the most common method).  Upon completion of the
            spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points,
            vigor, and health, with no negative levels (or Constitution points)
            and all of the prepared spells possessed by the creature when it
            died.  You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone
            who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed.

      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      none</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> 1 nanite canister;
      <strong>Usage</strong> 1 charge or 5
      charges</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Nanite hypoguns inject specialized
      nanites into a creature's body to heal many sorts of physical and mental
      injuries. Injecting someone with a nanite hypogun requires a touch attack.
      Nine categories of nanite hypogun exist along the color code scale, as
      detailed below. All nanite hypoguns have two settings. On the primary
      setting, the hypogun heals an amount of hit point damage determined by its
      color. Each use of a hypogun on its primary setting consumes 1 charge. On
      the secondary setting, a dose from a nanite hypogun has a different effect
      determined by its color-these effects mimic specific restorative spells as
      indicated on the chart below. Each use of a hypogun on its secondary
      setting consumes 5 charges. Although they are not magical, nanite hypoguns
      have an effective caster level for the purposes of determining the potency
      of their effects as required by special circumstances (such as determining
      if a disease is cured, or if damage caused by a clay golem's cursed wound
      ability can be healed).</p><p>A nanite hypogun functions only on a living,
      corporeal creature. It has no effect on undead creatures
      whatsoever.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Primary
