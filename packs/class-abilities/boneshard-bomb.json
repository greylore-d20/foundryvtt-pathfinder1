      "value": "<p>This discovery is popular among necromancers and necrologists alike; aside from its offensive potential, necrologists sometimes use it to turn uncooperative live creatures they wish to question into pliable undead. The alchemist’s bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, and creatures that take a direct hit from a boneshard bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of bleed damage in addition to normal damage. If a creature is killed by a boneshard bomb or the resulting bleed effect, its corpse immediately reanimates as an undead creature with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Human%20Skeleton\">skeleton template</a>. Skeletons that are created in this manner count as undead created by @Compendium[pf1.spells.8uwmrygxgih1fb57]{Animate Dead}&nbsp;for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must possess the alchemical zombie discovery to select this discovery.</p>"
