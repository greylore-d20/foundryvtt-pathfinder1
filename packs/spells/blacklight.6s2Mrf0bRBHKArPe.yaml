      <p>You create an area of total darkness. The darkness is impenetrable even
      to darkvision, but you can see normally within it. Creatures outside the
      spell's area, even you, cannot see through it.</p>

      <p>You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is
      stationary unless cast on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a
      creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it
      moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or
      benefit from spell resistance. <em>Blacklight</em> counters or dispels any
      light spell of equal or lower level. <em>Daylight</em> counters or dispels
      <em>blacklight</em>.</p>
