    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can
      expend 1 point of
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.dv8TDGs9c7h4awY2]{mental focus}
      to unleash a ray of pure energy as a ranged touch attack. This ray has a
      range of 30 feet. The ray deals an amount of energy damage equal to 1d6
      points + 1d6 points for every 2 occultist levels you possess beyond 1st
      (2d6 at 3rd level, 3d6 at 5th, and so on, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th
      level).</p><p>When you unleash an energy ray, you must decide what type of
      damage it deals (acid, cold, electricity, or fire).</p><hr
