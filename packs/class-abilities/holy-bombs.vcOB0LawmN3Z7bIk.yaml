      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal good
      divine damage. Evil creatures that take a direct hit from a holy bomb must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against
      neutral creatures, holy bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not
      affected by their staggering effect. Holy bombs have no effect on
      good-aligned creatures.</p><p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level
      before selecting this discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link
