      <p>This combination of loose-fitting sashes, veils, and ornamentation
      accentuates a dancer's form and movements.</p>

      <p>Dancer's garb provides a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on
      <em>Perform</em> (dance) checks, similar to that provided by masterwork
      instruments for other <em>Perform</em> skills, but does not grant this
      benefit when worn with armor or other concealing clothing.</p>
