  shortDescription: >-
    <p>With a dark incantation and a gesture of your hand over your eyes, you
    cause a shroud of <i>darkness</i> to descend upon the targets of this spell.
    The subjects treat the light level as two steps lower than normal for the
    duration of this spell. Bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes
    <i>darkness</i>, and areas of dim light and <i>darkness</i> become
    supernaturally dark (as <i>darkness</i>, but even creatures with darkvision
    cannot see).</p>
