  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The
      mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw
      against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful
      save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her
      save, she takes no damage.</p>

      <p>If the mesmerist is 12th level or higher, the subject takes only half
      damage if she fails her save. The benefits of this trick donâ€™t stack with
      those of the evasion or stalwart class features.</p>
