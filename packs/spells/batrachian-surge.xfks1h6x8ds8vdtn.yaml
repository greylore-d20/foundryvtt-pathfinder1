  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You tap into your latent amphibian strengths, unlocking a short-lived
      physical talent. Armor or gear you are wearing adjusts to your new shape
      for the duration of the spell. When you cast <i>batrachian surge</i>,
      choose one of the following features to gain its associated benefits. You
      can have only one <i>batrachian surge</i> spell active on you at a time.
      <b>Gills</b>: Your throat expands, and gill slits appear along your neck.
      You can breathe underwater. <b>Leaping</b>: Your legs elongate and become
      especially muscular. You are always treated as having a running start when
      attempting Acrobatics checks to jump, and you gain a competence bonus on
      Acrobatics checks to jump equal to your caster level. <b>Swimming</b>: You
      grow a large tadpole tail, and your other limbs shrink slightly. You gain
      a swim speed equal to your base land speed. <b>Tongue</b>: Your tongue
      extends to the length of your body. Increase your reach by 5 feet when
      delivering touch spells. This increased reach doesn't stack with any other
      spells or abilities that affect your reach.</p>
