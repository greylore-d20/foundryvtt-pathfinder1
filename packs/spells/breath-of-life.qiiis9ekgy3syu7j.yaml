    value: >-
      <p>This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
      (maximum +25).</p><p>Unlike other spells that heal damage, <i>Breath of
      Life</i> can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a
      creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell
      to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative
      amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and
      stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total
      is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score,
      the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through
      <i>Breath of Life</i> gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1
      day.</p><p>Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by <i>Breath
      of Life</i>.</p><p>Like cure spells, <i>Breath of Life</i> deals damage to
      undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to
      life.</p>
