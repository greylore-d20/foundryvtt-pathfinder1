  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A sheer wall of flame appears and rushes away from you. Tendrils of
      fire reach out of it, shaped into skulls screaming in agony. When the wall
      passes through a creature's space, that creature must succeed at a Reflex
      save or take 1d8 points of fire damage for every 2 caster levels you have
      (maximum 5d8). Any creature taking fire damage must also succeed at a Will
      save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Deaf creatures receive a +4
      circumstance bonus on their Will saves.  If your campaign uses the sanity
      system (see page 12), a creature takes 1d6 points of sanity damage instead
      of Wisdom damage.</p>
