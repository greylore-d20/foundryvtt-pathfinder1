  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, you merge with an adjacent natural stone
      surface, forming a 5-foot pocket within. If the stone surface does not
      have enough volume to safely contain a 5-foot sphere of empty space, the
      spell fails. When created, there is sufficient air within the pocket for
      up to one Medium creature to survive for the spell's duration, including
      one additional Tiny or smaller creature, such as a familiar. At the end of
      the spell's duration, you are immediately expelled into the nearest
      available open space adjacent to the surface you merged with.</p>
