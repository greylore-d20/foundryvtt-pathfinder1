  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>flesh puppet</i>, but can animate multiple
    zombies. As noted in <i>animate dead</i>, you can't control more than 4 HD
    per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create
    more than 2 HD per caster level. A separate string attaches to each zombie
    in your horde. Severing a zombie's string reverts that zombie to a corpse,
    but doesn't end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a <i>flesh
    puppet</i> requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one
    zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow
    their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per round. 
    Unlike with <i>flesh puppet</i>, you can command a zombie to attack. If you
    do, all your zombies immediately gain the staggered quality and no longer
    appear to be alive.  This spell ends automatically if you cast <i>flesh
    puppet</i> or <i>flesh puppet</i> horde on a new corpse.</p>
