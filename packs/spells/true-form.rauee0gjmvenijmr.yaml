      <p><i>True form</i> removes any polymorph effect from a target creature,
      returning it to its true form, even against its will. Against creatures
      affected by polymorph spell effects (such as <i>baleful polymorph</i> or
      <i>giant</i> form), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster
      level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
      Success means that the polymorph immediately ends.</p><p>A creature with
      the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) must make
      a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails
      this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving
      throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the
      creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save
      fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the
      spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its
      shape.</p>
