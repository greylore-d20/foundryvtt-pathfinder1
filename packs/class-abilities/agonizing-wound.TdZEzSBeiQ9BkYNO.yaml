      <p>At 13th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage to a
      creature, you can also make that creature frightened or sickened (your
      choice) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. If you
      expend two uses of this ability, you can instead have the creature become
      dazed, nauseated, or panicked for 1 round. The creature can attempt a Will
      saving throw to negate this effect.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Charisma modifier.</p>

      <p>This is a mind-affecting pain effect.</p>
