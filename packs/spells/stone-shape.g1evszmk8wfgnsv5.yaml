      <p>You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your
      purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth
      with <i>stone shape</i>, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance
      that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.</p>
