  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell
      can only be cast on a single tree at a time; while <i>liveoak</i> is in
      effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. <i>Liveoak</i> must be
      cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per
      caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The <i>liveoak</i> spell
      triggers the tree into animating as a treant.</p><p>If <i>liveoak</i> is
      dispelled, the tree takes root immediately wherever it happens to be. If
      released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before
      taking root.</p>
