      -</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A dart gun makes use of nanotechnology to
      craft a small pointed projectile that does minimal damage on its own.
      Unlike other nanotech weapons, the nanites that make up a dart do not have
      any additional effect on the target. Instead, a dart gun contains a small
      reservoir above its handle into which a single dose of a pharmaceutical,
      drug, poison, or even potion can be poured as a standard action. The next
      dart fired from the dart gun delivers that liquid into the target
      immediately upon a hit.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong>
