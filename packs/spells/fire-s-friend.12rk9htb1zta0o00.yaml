  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You cloak yourself in flames that do not harm you or your carried
      equipment but damage other creatures and objects. The flames cast light as
      a torch. Any creature that attacks you with a non-reach melee weapon or
      that begins its turn engaged in a grapple with you takes 1d6 points of
      fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. The creature
      can negate the damage (and avoid catching fire) with spell resistance. Any
      time you end your movement in the same square as a flammable object or
      creature, that creature or object must succeed at a Reflex save or catch
      fire.</p>
