  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target experiences feelings of ennui and lethargy, becoming fatigued
    for the spell's duration. While the target is fatigued and is within the
    spell's range, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. On
    a successful save, the target is fatigued for only 1d4 rounds and you
    receive no bonus. This spell has no effect if it targets a creature that is
    already fatigued.</p>
