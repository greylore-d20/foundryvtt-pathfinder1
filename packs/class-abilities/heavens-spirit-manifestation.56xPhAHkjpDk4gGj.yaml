    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes the spirit of heaven. She
      receives a bonus on all saving throws equal to her Wisdom modifier. She
      automatically stabilizes if she is reduced to below 0 hit points. She’s
      immune to fear effects, and she automatically confirms all critical hits
      she threatens. If she dies, she’s reborn 3 days later in the form of a
      star child, maturing over the course of 7 days (as reincarnate).</p>
