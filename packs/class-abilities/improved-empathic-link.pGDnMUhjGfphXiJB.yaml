  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal
      companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except
      the hunter can also see through a companionâ€™s eyes as a swift action,
      maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion
      is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded
      while maintaining this connection.</p>
