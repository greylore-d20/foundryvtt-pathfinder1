  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian gains a breath weapon that she can use once
      per day. For every 2 barbarian levels, this breath weapon deals 1d6 points
      of damage of the energy type she choose for the draconic blood power,
      either in a 30-foot cone (if cold or fire) or a 60-foot line (if acid or
      electricity). Those caught in the area of the breath can attempt a Reflex
      saving throw for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
      barbarianâ€™s level + her Constitution modifier.</p><p>A greater blood rage
      power can be taken only by a barbarian of 10th level or higher who already
      has the middle blood rage power.</p>
