  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>alarm</i>, except that you can tweak the
      spell to be more discerning in what types of creatures or objects trigger
      the <i>alarm</i>. Instead of being triggered whenever a creature of Tiny
      size or larger enters the warded area, you can set whatever triggering
      conditions you wish, as long as they are based on observable phenomenon.
      For example, you could cause the selective <i>alarm</i> to trigger when
      creatures of a certain race (such as orcs, bugbears, or kobolds) enter the
      area, or whenever a group of four or more creatures enters the area
      together, or when a metal object is brought into the area. You can't
      choose triggering conditions that rely on unobservable information, such
      as having it triggered when creatures of a certain alignment enter the
      area, nor could you have the <i>alarm</i> be triggered by "something worth
      more than 5,000 gp" entering the area, or even "a weapon" entering the
      area, because an item's value and classification as a weapon is
      subjective, and might vary from one person to the next.</p>
