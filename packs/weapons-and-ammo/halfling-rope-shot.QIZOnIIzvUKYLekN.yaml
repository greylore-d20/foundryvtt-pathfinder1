      a sling bullet wrapped in a monkey's fist knot, and the other end is tied
      in a small loop. You wrap the loop around your wrist as a full-round
      action and swing the weighted end like a flail. If the loop is properly
      attached to your wrist and you drop the rope-shot or are disarmed, you can
      recover it as a swift action. Removing the weapon's loop is a full-round
      action. You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a
      rope-shot on your body. Halflings treat rope-shots as martial weapons.</p>
