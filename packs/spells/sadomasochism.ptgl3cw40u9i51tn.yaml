      <p>While subject to this spell, anytime you are dealt damage, your
      attacker must roll damage for the attack twice and take the higher result,
      but the attacker must also succeed at a Will saving throw or be
      demoralized (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 99) for 1 round. Each
      time you deal damage to a creature demoralized by this spell, you roll
      damage twice and take the higher result. This spell originally appeared in
      <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Inner Sea Gods</i>.</p>
