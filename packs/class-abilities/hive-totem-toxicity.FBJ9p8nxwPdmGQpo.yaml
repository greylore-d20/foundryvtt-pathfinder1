  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian increases her bite damage die type with the
      animal fury rage power by one die type and decreases the penalty on attack
      rolls with that bite to –2. Once per rage, a bite that hits can deliver an
      injury toxin that has a frequency of once per round for 4 rounds, deals
      1d3 points of Constitution damage, and has a cure of one save. The saving
      throw has a Fortitude save DC of 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the
      barbarian’s Constitution modifier.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the hive totem and hive totem resilience rage
      powers and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p>
