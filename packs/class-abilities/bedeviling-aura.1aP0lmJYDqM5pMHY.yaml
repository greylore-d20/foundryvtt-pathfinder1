  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that bedevils your enemies
      with phantasmal assailants. Enemies within this aura move at half
      <em>speed</em>, are unable to take <em>attacks of opportunity</em>, and
      are considered to be flanked. This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use
      this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level.
      These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
