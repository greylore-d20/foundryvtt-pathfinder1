      <p>Favored by the spellcasters of Irrisen, this potent spell can disrupt
      spellcasters, topple enemies, and break even seemingly unstoppable
      charges.  One or more giant spears of ice lance up out of the ground. Each
      stalagmite-like icicle affects a 5-foot square and tapers to a height of
      10 feet. You may cause a number of <i>ice spears</i> equal to one spear
      for every 4 caster levels you possess to burst from the ground. A creature
      that occupies a square from which a spear extends (or that is within 10
      feet of the ground below) takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6
      points of cold damage per square-creatures that take up more than 1 square
      can be hit by multiple spears if your caster level is high enough. The
      explosive growth can also trip foes. When the spears erupt from the
      ground, they attempt a combat maneuver check to trip any targets that take
      damage from the spears, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus
      your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest.
      Each additional <i>ice spear</i> beyond the first that strikes a single
      foe grants a +10 bonus on this combat maneuver check. If the check is
      successful, the <i>ice spears</i> knock the foe prone. A successful Reflex
      save halves the damage and prevents the trip attempt.  If you cast this
      spell upon an area covered with ice or snow, such as a glacier, frozen
      lake, or snow-covered field, the spears strike with additional force.
      Saves against the effect take a -2 penalty, and the spell effect gains a
      +4 bonus on the combat maneuver check to trip foes. <i>Ice spears</i>
      created by this spell remain after they do their damage. They melt as
      normal depending on the surrounding environment. They no longer damage
      foes in their square, but can provide cover. An <i>ice spear</i> has
      hardness 5 and 30 hit points.</p>
