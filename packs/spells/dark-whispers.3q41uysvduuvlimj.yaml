  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You communicate through the shadows of one or more targets within
      range. The shadows have no physical presence and don't move or animate.
      Instead, your words emerge from the shadow as a clear whisper, absent any
      accent or other identifying features. The targets can make conversation
      with the shadow, but must speak aloud to do so. The targets' voices emerge
      from your own shadow only when they intend to speak to the shadow, but you
      hear no other sounds from the target's immediate area. Their responses
      also emerge as clear whispers, absent identifying features, but you can
      instinctively identify which target is speaking to you through the shadow.
      Once the spell has been cast, you don't need to have line of effect to the
      targets or their shadows to communicate back and forth.  The shadow
      communication is audible, so it can be intercepted by adversaries who
      succeed at a DC 25 Perception check. The spell can be silenced. You can't
      cast spells on subjects or otherwise establish line of effect through the
      shadows, but spells that allow you to speak or understand languages work
      normally across <i>dark whispers</i>.</p>
