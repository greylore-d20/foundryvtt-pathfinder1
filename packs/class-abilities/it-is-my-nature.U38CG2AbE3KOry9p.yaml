  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, your poisoned blood protects you, reflexively conjuring
      an ethereal stinger to lash out at foes who come too close. Three times
      per day when an enemy moves into a square adjacent to you, you can make a
      melee <em>touch attack</em> against the creature as an <em>immediate
      action</em>. On a hit, the creature must succeed at a <em>Fortitude</em>
      save (DC = 10 + half your <em>sorcerer</em> level + your <em>Charisma</em>
      modifier) or die. A creature that succeeds at this <em>Fortitude</em> save
      is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a poison and death effect.
      You can use this ability even when you are surprised or
      <em>flat-footed</em>.</p>
