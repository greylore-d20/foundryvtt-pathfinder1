      <p>Infusing the target with a surge of furious divine energy, you enhance
      a creature's ability to hit an opponent based on the number of times it
      has already hit that opponent with a successful attack. Each time the
      subject successfully strikes an opponent with a successful melee attack,
      the subject gains a cumulative +1 morale bonus on attack rolls (maximum +4
      bonus) and gains 1d8 temporary hit points (to a maximum of 20 temporary
      hit points). If an attack misses, the attack bonus resets to +0 but any
      accumulated temporary hit points remain. The temporary hit points
      disappear at the end of the spell's duration.</p>
