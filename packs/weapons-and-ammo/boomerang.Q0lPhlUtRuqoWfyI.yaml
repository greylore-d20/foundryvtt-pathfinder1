  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The boomerang is primarily a hunting tool, but it is not uncommon for
      these versatile thrown weapons to be carried into battle. A boomerang is
      made of wood and is flat, with a long haft, a pronounced forward curve,
      and a sharp backward bend at the head. A hunting boomerang does not fly in
      a returning path.</p>
