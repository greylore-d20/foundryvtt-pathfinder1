      <p>With a short command and a wave of the hand, you compel the target
      creature to attack the being who summoned it, to the best of its ability.
      If the being who summoned it is not present, the creature acts normally
      according to its last task or instructions. This spell has no effect on
      called creatures, summoned creatures not brought forth by spells or
      spell-like abilities (such as a summoner's eidolon), or bonded creatures
      not explicitly summoned, such as a paladin's mount or wizard's
      familiar.</p>
