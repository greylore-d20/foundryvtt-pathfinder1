    value: >-
      <p>You can cast this spell as an immediate action when you fail a Climb
      check and would fall. You can immediately attempt another Climb check as a
      free action at a -2 penalty. Each successive use of this spell in a
      particular situation increases the penalty by 2. If successful, you don't
      fall, but you don't progress at climbing.</p>
