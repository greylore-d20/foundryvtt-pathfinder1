      <p><b>Source</b> Martial Arts Handbook pg. 24</p><p><em>You slam into your
      foes with brute strength as unyielding as a
      wall.</em></p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Str 13, Improved Bull Rush,
      Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Whenever you
      successfully bull rush an enemy and its movement is stopped by a solid
      object or barrier, you deal your unarmed strike damage to the foe, as long
      as itâ€™s within your threatened area. If you performed your bull rush as
      part of a charge, you gain a +2 bonus on your damage roll.</p>
