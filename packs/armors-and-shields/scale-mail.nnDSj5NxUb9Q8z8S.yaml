  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Scale mail is made up of dozens of small, overlapping metal plates.
      Similar to both splint mail and banded mail, scalemail has a flexible
      arrangement of scales in an attempt to avoid hindering the wearerâ€™s
      mobility, but at the expense of omitting additional protective layers of
      armor. A suit of scale mail includes gauntlets.</p>
