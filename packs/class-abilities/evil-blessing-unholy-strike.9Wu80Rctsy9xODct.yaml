    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and give it an evil blessing.
      For 1 minute, this weapon takes on a black, orange, or violet cast and
      deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against good creatures. During
      this time, it’s treated as evil for the purposes of overcoming damage
      reduction. This additional damage doesn’t stack with the additional damage
      from the unholy weapon special ability.</p>
