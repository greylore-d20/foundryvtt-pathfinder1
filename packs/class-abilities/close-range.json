He can use a ranged touch attack spell that targets more than one creature (such as&nbsp;scorching ray), but he makes only one melee touch attack to deliver one of these ranged touch effects; additional ranged touch attacks from that spell are wasted and have no effect. These spells can be used with the spellstrike class feature.</p>"
