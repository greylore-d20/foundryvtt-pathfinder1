      Weapons</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This arrow is tipped with a tiny vial of
      tanglefoot goo. Firing a tangleshot arrow is a ranged touch attack; the
      arrow deals no damage when it hits, but the target is splashed with the
      alchemical adhesive.</p><p>This effect is similar to that of a
      @Compendium[pf1.items.utncinnlwzscpzbd]{Tanglefoot Bag}, but with the
      following adjustments: Reflex DC 10, Strength DC 12 to break, 10 points of
      slashing damage to cut through, concentration DC 10 to cast
      spells.</p><p>A tangleshot arrow imposes a -1 penalty on attack rolls
      because of its weight.</p><h3>Alchemical
      Recipe</h3><p><strong>Recipe</strong> (18 myrrh + 26 urea)/congelation;
