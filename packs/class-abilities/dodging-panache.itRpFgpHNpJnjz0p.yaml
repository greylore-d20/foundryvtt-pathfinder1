  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against the
      swashbuckler, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action spend 1 panache
      point to move 5 feet; doing so grants the swashbuckler a dodge bonus to AC
      equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack.
      This movement doesn't negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the
      swashbuckler had not moved from the original square. This movement is not
      a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other
      than the one who triggered this deed. The swashbuckler can only perform
      this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no heavier
      than a light load.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
