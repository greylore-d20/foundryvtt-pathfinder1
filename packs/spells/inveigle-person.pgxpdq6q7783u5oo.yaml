    value: >-
      <p>You cause the target to become extremely amiable. The target treats all
      other living creatures as if it were friendly toward them. Any overtly
      hostile or harmful act toward the target by any living creature ends the
      spell.  An inveigled creature attempts to fulfill multiple requests in the
      same manner as it would favors for its true friends. If such requests
      conflict, it usually chooses the more reasonable option-overriding this
      preference requires succeeding at an opposed Charisma check, as if under
      multiple forms of mental control (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>
      209).</p>
