  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You curse the target to suffer a violent accident  within the next 24
    hours. You have no control over the form the accident takes or when it
    strikes. The target can avoid being cursed with spell resistance when you
    cast the spell, but otherwise receives no saving throw. Regardless of the
    accident's nature, it is magically empowered to deal an amount of damage
    equal to 1d8 x your caster level (maximum 5d8 points of damage), and the
    damage is of a type appropriate to the source of damage (such as fire for an
    explosion or bludgeoning for a falling object). When the accident occurs,
    the target can attempt a Reflex saving throw to reduce the damage by half.
    Although others might be surprised or inconvenienced by the accident, it
    damages only the target.</p>
