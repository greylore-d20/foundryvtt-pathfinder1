      "value": "<p>Once per day, the alchemist can concoct a foul-tasting tincture that harnesses the power of the spirit. By drinking this tincture as a standard action, the alchemist can invite the latent spirits in the area to surround him. The alchemist can channel one spirit for every 4 alchemist levels he possesses. Each spirit channeled this way grants the alchemist a +1 deflection bonus to AC as the spirits whirl around his body. As a standard action, the alchemist can launch one of these spirits toward a target as a ranged touch attack. Launching a spirit this way reduces this discovery’s deflection bonus to AC by 1. As a launched spirit passes through its target’s body, it emits a terrible wail heard only in the target’s mind, causing the target to become frightened for 1 round per alchemist level (Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the wail cannot be affected by this discovery again for 24 hours. The spirits whirl around the alchemist’s body for 10 minutes per alchemist level, or until the alchemist has launched all of the spirits.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level to select this discovery.</p>"
