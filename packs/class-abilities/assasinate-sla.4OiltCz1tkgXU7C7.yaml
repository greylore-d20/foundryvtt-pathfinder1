  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A slayer with this advanced talent can kill foes that are unable to
      defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the slayer must
      first study his target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following
      round, if the slayer makes a sneak attack against the target and that
      target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the
      additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt
      automatically fails if the target recognizes the slayer as an enemy. If
      the sneak attack is successful, the target must attempt a Fortitude saving
      throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the slayer’s level + the slayer’s
      Intelligence modifier. If the target fails this save, it dies; otherwise,
      the target takes the sneak attack damage as normal and is then immune to
      that slayer’s assassinate ability for 24 hours.</p>
