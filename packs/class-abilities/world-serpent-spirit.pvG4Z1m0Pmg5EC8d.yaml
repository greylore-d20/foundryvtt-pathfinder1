  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian considers her weapons to be chaotic-,
      evil-, good-, and lawful-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage
      reduction. She also gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against
      spells and effects that have an alignment descriptor or come from an
      outsider or aberration. This bonus increases by +1 for each world serpent
      rage power the barbarian possesses, excluding this one.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the world serpent totem rage power and be at
      least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p>
