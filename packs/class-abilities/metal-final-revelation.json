      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of iron and steel. You gain the benefits of @Compendium[pf1.feats.n250dFlbykAIAg5Z]{Weapon Focus}, @Compendium[pf1.feats.IER2MzJrjSvxMlNS]{Greater Weapon Focus}s, and @Compendium[pf1.feats.TbOPtIL8Fv8obXtP]{Improved Critical} with any one metal weapon that you are proficient with. Your armor is like a second skin to you—while wearing metal armor you are proficient with, the armor's maximum Dexterity bonus increases by +5 and you take no armor check penalty. In addition, any metal you create with your magic (such as wall of iron) has its hardness increased by +10.</p>"
