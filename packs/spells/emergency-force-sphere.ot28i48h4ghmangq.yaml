  shortDescription: >-
    <p>As <i>Wall of Force</i>, except you create a hemispherical dome of force
    with hardness 20 and a number of hit points equal to 10 per caster level.
    The bottom edge of the dome forms a relatively watertight space if you are
    standing on a reasonably flat surface. The dome shape means that falling
    debris (such as rocks from a collapsing ceiling) tend to tumble to the side
    and pile up around the base of the dome. If you make a DC 20 Craft
    (stonemasonry), Knowledge (engineering), or Profession (architect or
    engineer) check, the debris is stable enough that it retains its dome-like
    configuration when the spell ends, otherwise it collapses.</p><p>Normally
    this spell is used to buy time for dealing with avalanches, floods, and
    rockslides, though it is also handy in dealing with ambushes.</p>
