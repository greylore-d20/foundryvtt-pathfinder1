  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist’s
      hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of
      additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist’s class level (minimum 1).
      The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even
      if it isn’t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his
      own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3
      class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and
      is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>

      <p>A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single
      creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists’ painful stares in a
      round.</p>
