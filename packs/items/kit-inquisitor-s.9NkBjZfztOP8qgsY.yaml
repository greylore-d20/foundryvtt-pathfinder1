            <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot
            radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional
            20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light
            becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in
            normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it
            as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
            equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire
            damage.</p>

            <h3>Magic Containers</h3>

            <p>Magic containers come in almost as many varieties as there are
            <em>alchemists</em>, and so are of inestimable value to
            <em>alchemists</em> with specific needs. Some of the most well-known
            magic containers are described here.</p>

            <p>Because of a varied nature of alchemical items and their effects,
            not all combinations of alchemical items and magic bottles are
            viable or even make sense, even though they technically might be
            allowed by the rules. The GM should have the final say on whether or
            not a particular alchemical item can function within one of the
            magical containers listed in this section.</p>

            <h4>Rope</h4>

            <p><b>Hempen</b> The DC to escape hemp rope bonds is equal to 20 +
            the CMB of the creature that tied the bonds. Ropes do not need to
            make a check every round to maintain the pin. If the DC to escape is
            higher than 20 + the tying creatures CMB, the tied up creature
            cannot escape from the bonds, even with a natural 20 on the check.
            This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength
            check. <b>Price</b> 1 gp; <b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>FYI</b>: The <em>Equipment Trick</em> feat provides a number
            of options for using this item in combat.</p>

            <p><b>Silk Rope</b> This 50-foot length of silk rope has 4 hit
            points and can be broken with a DC 24 Strength check. <b>Price</b>
            10 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>Bloodvine Rope</b> This 50-foot length of tough, lightweight
            rope is made from alchemically treated bloodvine, a rare
            scarlet-colored vine that grows only in warm jungle environments.
            Though prized by climbers for its durability, bloodvine can also be
            used to bind creatures. Bloodvine rope has a <em>hardness</em> of 5
            and 10 <em>hit points</em>, and can be broken with a DC 30
            <em>Strength</em> check. A creature bound by bloodvine rope can
            escape with a DC 35 <em>Escape Artist</em> check or a DC 30
            <em>Strength</em> check. The DC to create bloodvine rope with
            <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) is 30. <b>Price</b> 200 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5
            lbs. <b>Source</b> <em>PRG:ACG</em></p>

            <p><b>Spider's Silk Rope</b> This 50-foot length of rope is woven of
            strands of silk from monstrous spiders. Rare to virtually
            nonexistent on the surface world, it is commonly used by the dark
            elves, though shorter spider's silk rope scraps (generally no more
            than 10 feet long) occasionally appear among goblins. Spider's silk
            rope has 6 hit points and can be broken with a DC 25 Strength check.

            <h4>Candle</h4>

            <p>A candle dimly illuminates a small area, increasing the light
            level in a 5-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light and
            dim light becomes normal light). A candle cannot increase the light
            level above normal light. A candle burns for 1 hour. <b>Price</b> 1
            cp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>

            <p><b>Candle, Helmet</b> This device consists of a helmet with a
            short, thin spike on top upon which a <em>candle</em> is stuck,
            freeing your hands for other tasks. <b>Price</b> 2 gp; <b>Weight</b>
            4 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>Candle Lamp</b> A candle lamp is a small lantern-like device
            with glass panels and a slot to hold a <em>candle</em>. It protects
            the <em>candle</em> from drafts and catches wax drippings. It
            provides the same light as a <em>candle</em>, but can be shuttered
            such that it only illuminates 1 to 3 adjacent squares. You can use a
            <em>candle lamp</em> to keep your hands warm. <b>Price</b> 5 gp;
            <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>

            <p><b>Candlestick</b> This saucer-like object has a flat bottom, a
            handle, and a spike on top. You can affix a <em>candle</em> onto the
            spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the candlestick by the
            handle. The flat bottom means you're able to set it down and not
            worry about the <em>candle</em> falling over and extinguishing
            itself. A typical candlestick is crafted from baked <em>clay</em> or
            a cheap metal such as copper, but elaborate and expensive ones
            exist. <b>Price</b> 1 cp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>

            <p><b>Holy Text</b> This is the religious text of a particular
            religion, with a title, text, and detailed rites specific to that
            faith. The cheap variety is a small, light book with no
            illustrations, printed or written on thin paper, and with a cover
            made of <em>canvas</em> or thin leather. A typical <em>holy
            text</em> for an experienced adventuring priest is durable, with a
            leather cover, chapter illustrations, quality paper; it costs 25 gp
            and weighs 2 pounds. The most expensive versions have detailed
            illustrations, gilded initials and border decorations, covers made
            of fine leather, wood, or even metal, and are often oversized and
            difficult to carry around. <b>Price</b> 1-100 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1-20

            <p>Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use
            the <em>Escape Artist</em> skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for
            masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a
            <em>Strength</em> check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles).
            Manacles have <em>hardness</em> 10 and 10 <em>hit points</em>.</p>

            <p>Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to
            the cost of the manacles.</p>

            <p>For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For
            a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and
            for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan,
            Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by
            specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated
            amount.</p>

            <p><b>Expanded Information</b></p>

            <p class="source"><b>Source</b>: <em>PZO9293</em></p>

            <p><b>Fetters</b>: These manacles are specifically designed to fit
            around the ankles, and use the same rules for breaking, escape, and
            cost relative to size. A creature in fetters is entangled and can
            move at only half speed. In addition, a fettered creature must
            succeed at a DC 15 <em>Acrobatics</em> check to move more than its
            (reduced) speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the
            creature falls prone.</p>

            <p><b>Frontal Restraint</b>: A creature whose wrists are bound with
            manacles can wield only one melee weapon or shield in combat (the
            weapon may be a two-handed weapon). It cannot make use of ranged
            weapons, except for crossbows (but even these cannot be reloaded by
            the bound creature). Any attack the creature makes while manacled
            takes a -4 penalty. The creature can attempt skill checks using its
            hands, but at a -5 penalty (-15 on Disable Device checks to pick the
            lock of manacles the creature is wearing).</p>

            <p><b>Rear Restraint</b>: Manacles might be employed to keep a
            creature's hands behind its back. In such cases, the creature cannot
            use its hands to effectively employ any weapon or shield. The
            creature can attempt to use its hands to perform a skill, but at a
            -10 penalty (-25 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of
            manacles the creature is wearing). While manacled, a creature can
            attempt to flip its arms beneath its legs, bringing its hands in
            front of itself. This requires a successful DC 25 Escape Artist
            check (a separate Escape Artist check is then required to escape the
            manacles).</p>

            <p><b>Restraining Two Individuals</b>: Two creatures might share one
            set of manacles. While manacled together, the manacled individuals
            must remain adjacent to one another. If they are not working
            together, they are both treated as grappled. If they are working
            together, they can move together in the same round (using the
            movement speed of the slower creature). A manacled creature can
            forfeit its turn during combat to mimic the other manacled
            creature's movements, allowing that creature to act as if
            unrestrained.</p>

            <p>A holy symbol focuses positive energy and is used by good clerics
            and paladins (or by neutral clerics who want to cast good spells or
            channel positive energy). Each religion has its own holy symbol. The
            material used to make the holy symbol has no effect on its powers,
            though a religion may place special significance on a particular
            material.<br><br>Unholy Symbols: An unholy symbol is like a holy
            symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil
            clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or
            channel negative energy).</p>
