If he is targeted with an effect requiring a Reflex save while using this power, he may spend 2 points from his arcane pool as an immediate action to grant himself evasion, or 4 points to grant himself improved evasion.</p>\n<p>The magus must have the arcane redoubt magus arcana and be at least 12th level to select this magus arcana.</p>"
