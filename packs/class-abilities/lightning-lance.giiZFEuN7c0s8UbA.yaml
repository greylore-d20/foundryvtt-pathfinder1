    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can unleash a lance of lightning by expending 1 point from
      her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one
      target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 points of
      electricity damage + the arcanist’s Charisma modifier, plus 1d6 points of
      electricity damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at
      19th level). The target’s vision is also impaired, causing the target to
      treat all creatures as if they had concealment (20%) for 1 round. It can
      attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the impaired vision.</p>
