  description:
    value: >-
      <p>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself
      effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra
      damage.</p><p>The rogue’s attack deals extra damage anytime her target
      would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a
      Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra
      damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels
      thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target
      is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not
      multiplied on a critical hit.</p><p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal
      damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a rogue can make a sneak
      attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot
      use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak
      attack—not even with the usual –4 penalty.</p><p>The rogue must be able to
      see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to
      reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature
      with total concealment.</p>
