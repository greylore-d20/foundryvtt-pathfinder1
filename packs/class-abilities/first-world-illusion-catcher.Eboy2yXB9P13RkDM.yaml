  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against illusions. If
      the arcanist successfully disbelieves an illusion, she can expend 1 point
      from her arcane reservoir to try to negate or steal control of the
      illusion. The arcanist attempts a caster level check as if she were
      dispelling the effect with @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel
      Magic}. If she succeeds, she can either end the effect or alter it as if
      she were the spell’s caster. If the spell’s duration is concentration, the
      arcanist must concentrate on the new effect or it ends.</p>

      <p>The arcanist must have the first-world face thief exploit to select
      this exploit.</p>
