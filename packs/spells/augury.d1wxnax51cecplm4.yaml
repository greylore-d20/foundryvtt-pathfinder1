  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An <i>augury</i> can tell you whether a particular action will bring
      good or bad results for you in the immediate future.</p><p>The base chance
      for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a
      maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so
      straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to
      have no chance of success. If the <i>augury</i> succeeds, you get one of
      four results: </p><ul><li>Weal (if the action will probably bring good
      results). </li><li>Woe (for bad results). </li><li>Weal and woe (for
      both). </li><li>Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or
      bad results).</li></ul><p></p><p>If the spell fails, you get the "nothing"
      result. A cleric who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether
      it was the consequence of a failed or successful <i>augury</i>.</p><p>The
      <i>augury</i> can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything
      that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result
      might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated
      action. All <i>auguries</i> cast by the same person about the same topic
      use the same die result as the first casting.</p>
