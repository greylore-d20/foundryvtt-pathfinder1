  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch curses a creature to share any effects that target her
      vitality. Whenever the witch is exposed to an effect that requires her to
      attempt a Fortitude save, as an immediate action she can curse a creature
      within 30 feet to share the effect. The hexed creature must also attempt a
      Fortitude save at the same DC as the witch’s, and on a failure it is
      subject to the same effects as the witch. Regardless of the outcome of the
      saving throw, the creature can’t be targeted by this hex again for 1
      day.</p>

      <p>This hex does not function with effects that require additional types
      of saves, such as phantasmal killer.</p>
