    value: >-
      <p>When benefiting from concealment, a character with this talent can
      forgo an attack of opportunity to attempt a Stealth check against the
      provoking opponent’s CMD. Success allows the character to treat her
      opponent as flat-footed against the character’s first melee attack before
      the end of her next turn. Using this ability does not count against the
      rogue’s available attacks of opportunity for the round. A character must
      be trained in Stealth to select this talent.</p>
