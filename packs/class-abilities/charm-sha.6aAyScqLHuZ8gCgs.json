This improves the attitude of an animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the shaman had successfully used the Diplomacy skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shamanâ€™s Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>\n<p>A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, this effect improves the attitude of the creature by 2 steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p>"
