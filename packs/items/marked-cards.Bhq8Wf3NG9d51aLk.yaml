      <p>Whether bent, colored, or scratched, marked cards allow an informed
      user to know whatâ€™s on the front of the card by viewing the mark on the
      back. Realizing that the cards are marked requires a DC 25 Perception
      check or DC 20 Profession (gambler) check. The listed price is for a
      common paper deck.</p>
