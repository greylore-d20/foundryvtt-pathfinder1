      "value": "<p>In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert—their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst—the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster’s component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day—once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.</p>\n<p>Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a <em>standard action</em> that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the <em>Throw Splash Weapon</em> special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.8rsFtye3PwM6CKli]{Point-Blank Shot} and @Compendium[pf1.feats.n250dFlbykAIAg5Z]{Weapon Focus}. On a direct hit, an alchemist’s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist’s <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. The damage of an alchemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital Strike}). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb’s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a <em>Reflex</em> save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>\n<p>Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the <em>Discovery</em> ability) as they level up. An alchemist’s bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p>"
