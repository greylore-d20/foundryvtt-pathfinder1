      <p><em>Your magical creations are hardier than
      most.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.4hNO4OAWYF5vXphH]{Craft Magic Arms and
      Armor}, ability to cast
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.x23pz2agjub1eh89]{make whole} or
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.24zg8a05hqum3e6j]{mending}.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>:
      When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, or magic shield, you can add a
      fortifying element to the item. This increases the item’s total
      construction cost by 10%. If it’s a weapon, when it becomes broken, the
      penalty to attack and damage rolls is reduced to –1 (this can never reduce
      a broken weapon’s penalty to attack and damage to 0 or a positive number).
      If it’s a suit of armor or a shield, when it becomes broken, the bonus it
      grants to AC is reduced by one-quarter, rounding down. Other drawbacks of
      the broken condition to weapons, armor, and shields still apply as normal.
      Normal: A broken weapon imposes a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
      The bonus a broken suit of armor or a broken shield grants to AC is
      halved.</p>
