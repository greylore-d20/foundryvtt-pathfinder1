      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can touch a weapon to cause it to glow with light by expending 1 point of mental focus. The weapon produces light like a torch. For the purpose of darkness spells and abilities, this effect counts as a light spell of level 0, plus 1 additional spell level for every 2 occultist levels you possess. This light lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. In addition, whenever the weapon scores a critical hit against a foe, the wielder can choose to end the effect, causing the foe to be surrounded by the radiance for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p>While illuminated in this way, the target canâ€™t benefit from concealment or invisibility, nor can it attempt Stealth checks to avoid being seen. All attack rolls made against an illuminated foe receive a +2 circumstance bonus.</p>"
