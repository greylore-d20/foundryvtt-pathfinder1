  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This extract greatly enhances the effects of any potion or elixir you
      consume. For the duration of this extract, any potion or elixir you
      consume is treated as if it were empowered. Increase all variable numeric
      effects of the potion or elixir by half. If the potion or elixir does not
      have any variable numeric effects, it is instead treated as if it were
      extended (double the duration of the potion or elixir). If the potion or
      elixir does not have any variable numeric effects, or has an instantaneous
      duration, amplify elixir has no effect. Amplify elixir affects oils that
      target you, but it has no effect on oils that target your equipment.</p>
