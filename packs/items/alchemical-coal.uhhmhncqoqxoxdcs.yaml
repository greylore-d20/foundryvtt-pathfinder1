    value: >-
      <p>A kobold who chews and swallows this alchemically treated piece of coal
      (a <em>full-round action</em>) can make one <em>breath weapon</em> attack
      during the next minute. If the kobold fails to make a breath attack before
      this minute expires, it is <em>sickened</em> for 1 hour. Other
      <em>humanoid</em> creatures that eat alchemical coal are <em>sickened</em>
      for 1 hour (though certain other creatures may be able to use them, at the
      GM's discretion). Creatures that are immune to <em>poison</em> are immune
      to the <em>sickened</em> effect. The type of <em>breath weapon</em>
      depends on the type of alchemical coal that is chewed by the kobold.</p>

      <p><i>Blinding Cinders</i>: This jagged bit of dusty red coal allows a
      kobold to breathe a 30-foot line of coarse cinders. The <em>breath
      weapon</em> deals 1d6 points of fire damage and blinds creatures in the
      area for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at a DC 15 <em>Reflex</em>
      saving throw takes half damage and is not <em>blinded</em>.</p>

      <p><i>Choking Smoke</i>: This crumbling chunk of chalky white coal allows
      a kobold to breathe a 15-foot cone of foul vapor that deals 1d6 points of
      acid damage and sickens a creature for 1d4 rounds. A creature that
      succeeds at a DC 15 <em>Reflex</em> saving throw takes half damage and is
      not <em>sickened</em>.</p>
