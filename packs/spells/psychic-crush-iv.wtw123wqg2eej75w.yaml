      <p>This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.199pl2cgawz38smh]{psychic crush I}, but
      the target takes 9d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level
      on a successful Fortitude or Will save. The target does not receive any
      saving throw bonus because of its hit points. If it is at fewer than half
      its total hit points, it doesn't gain a Fortitude save to resist this
      spell but instead proceeds as if it had automatically failed its Fortitude
      save. This spell can be undercast.</p>
