    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can create a ward that protects a specified area.
      Creating this ward takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. This ward has a
      maximum radius of 5 feet per 2 cleric levels you possess. When the ward is
      completed, you designate any number of creatures inside its area. Should
      any other creature enter the warded area, all of the selected creatures
      are immediately alerted (and awoken if they were asleep). The designated
      creatures also receive a sacred bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on all
      saving throws and attack rolls while inside the warded area. This ward
      immediately ends if you leave the area. The ward lasts for 1 hour per
      cleric level. You can use this ability once per day.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Unity power of the Community Subdomain.</p>
