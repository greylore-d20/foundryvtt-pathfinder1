      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Both<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes<p>“Half-fiend” is an inherited or
      acquired template that can be added to a living, corporeal creature with
      an Int score of 4 or more. A half-fiend uses all the base creature's
      statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<p><b>CR:</b> HD 4
      or less, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or
      more, as base creature + 3.<p><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil.<p><b>Type:</b>
      The creature's type changes to outsider (native). Do not recalculate HD,
      BAB, or saves.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by
      +1.<p><b>Defenses/Qualities:</b> Gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to
      poison; acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10; DR 5/magic (if HD
      11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more); and SR equal to creature's CR
      + 11 (maximum 35).<p><b>Speed:</b> Unless the base creature flies better,
      the half-fiend flies at twice the base creature's land speed
      (good).<p><b>Melee:</b> A half-fiend gains two claw attacks and a bite
      attack. Damage depends on its size (see pages 301–302).<p><b>Special
      Attacks:</b> A half-fiend gains the following.<p><em>Smite Good (Su):</em>
      Once per day as a swift action the half-fiend can smite good as the smite
      evil ability of a paladin of the same level as the half-fiend's Hit Dice,
      except affecting a good target. The smite persists until the target is
      dead of the half-fiend rests.<p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> A half-fiend
      with an Int or Wis score of 8 or higher has a cumulative number of
      spell-like abilities set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is
      usable 1/day. CL equals the creature's HD (or the CL of the base
      creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).</p>
