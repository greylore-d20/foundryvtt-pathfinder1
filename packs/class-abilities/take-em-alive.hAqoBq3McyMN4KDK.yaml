    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante doesnâ€™t take the usual -4 penalty on attack rolls made to
      deal nonlethal damage with weapons that normally deal lethal damage. In
      addition, the vigilante gains a +1 bonus on all attack and damage rolls
      for attacks that deal only nonlethal damage and have no secondary effects
      (such as poison).</p>

      <p>This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter,
      to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
