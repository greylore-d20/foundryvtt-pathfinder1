      touch</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A laser pistol emits a beam of intensely
      focused light capable of burning anything it strikes. A laser attack can
      pass through force fields and force effects, such as a <em>wall of
      force</em>, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects
      like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from
      lasers-but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still
      takes damage from a laser passing through it. Invisible creatures are
      immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds
      provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness
      (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing
      concealment, and though a laser consists of highly focused light, it does
      not provide any
      illumination.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 23;
