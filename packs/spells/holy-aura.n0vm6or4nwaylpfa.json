This abjuration has four effects.</p><p>First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike <i>Protection from Evil</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.</p><p>Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and mental influence, just as <i>Protection from Evil</i> does.</p><p>Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a <i>holy aura</i>, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as <i>blindness/deafness,</i> but against <i>holy aura</i>'s save DC).</p>"
