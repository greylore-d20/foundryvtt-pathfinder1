    "shortDescription": "<p>You place a protective ward over your spirit that ensnares creatures attempting to possess you. Should a creature attempt to possess you (such as via <i>magic jar</i> or a similar effect) while you are under the effects of <i>possession trap</i>, that creature must first succeed at a Will save or its possession attempt is ruined and its spirit is shunted into this spell's focus gem. The trapped creature is contained within the focus gem for 1 round per caster level, acting as though it were trapped in a <i>magic jar</i> for the duration of this effect. This effect fails if you are not carrying the focus gem during the time of the possession attempt.</p><p>If the possessor's Will save is successful, you are affected by its possession attempt as normal, and may attempt a saving throw against this possession attempt if one is normally allowed. Regardless of whether the possessor fails or succeeds at its save against <i>possession trap</i>, you immediately become aware of the possession attempt and whether or not a creature is trapped in the focus gem. If the focus gem is destroyed while it contains a creature, the creature is immediately released.</p><p>Once this spell is triggered, it offers no further protection, and a trapped creature can attempt to possess you again once it's free of the focus gem.</p>",
