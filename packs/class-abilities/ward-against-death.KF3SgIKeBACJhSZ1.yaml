  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that wards against death for
      a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Living creatures in
      this area are immune to all death effects, energy drain, and effects that
      cause negative levels. This ward does not remove negative levels that a
      creature has already gained, but the negative levels have no effect while
      the creature is inside the warded area. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>
