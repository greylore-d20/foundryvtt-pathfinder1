      <p>You can excavate and move earth, dust, and sand up to the size of a
      5-foot cube. If you are buried, you may open a 5-foot cube around
      yourself, but the spell cannot be used for tunneling.</p><p>Besides its
      mundane applications, you can open a 5-foot-deep pit at a creature's feet.
      A Medium or smaller creature falls prone in the pit unless it succeeds on
      a Reflex save. With a successful save, it can choose to land harmlessly on
      its feet in the pit or hop to an adjacent square; this movement does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature can escape a 5-foot-deep pit
      with a DC 5 Climb check. Larger creatures may ignore pits smaller than
      their size.</p><p>The earth excavated by this spell is ordinarily
      distributed harmlessly across the spell's range, but you may choose to
      throw up a burst of grit and debris when you dig a pit. This cloud of
      debris provides concealment to any creatures in the square affected and
      all adjacent squares for 1 round. <i>Expeditious excavation</i> has no
      effect on solid rock or earth creatures.</p>
