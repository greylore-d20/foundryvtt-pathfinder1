    value: >-
      <p>This deceptively complex weapon appears to be nothing more than a
      12-foot rope attached to a 6-inchlong, conical metal spike. Similar to a
      meteor hammer, it can be whirled at great speeds, then aimed to strike and
      pierce opponents with great reach. Once it strikes, the wielder can
      quickly retrieve the weapon with a tug of the rope as a free action.</p>
