  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the vigilante can cleverly strike his foe where
      that foe is weakest. This attack targets the foe’s touch AC, and the foe
      is denied her Dexterity bonus against the attack. Once a foe has been the
      target of perfect vulnerability, she can’t be the target of the same
      vigilante’s perfect vulnerability for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 8th level to select this talent.</p>
