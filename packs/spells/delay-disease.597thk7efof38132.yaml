      <p>The target becomes temporarily immune to disease. Any disease to which
      it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the target until
      the spell's duration has expired. If the target is currently infected with
      a disease, you must make a caster level check against the disease's DC to
      suspend it for the duration of the spell; otherwise, that disease affects
      the target normally. <i>Delay disease</i> does not cure any damage a
      disease may have already done.</p>
