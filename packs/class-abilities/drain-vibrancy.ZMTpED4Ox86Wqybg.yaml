  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, you can drain the color and vitality from the world
      around you. Three times per day, as a standard action you can drain
      vibrancy within a 30-foot radius, causing the area and all creatures
      within it to become pale and sallow. Each living creature in the area must
      succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your psychic level + your
      Wisdom modifier) or take 1 temporary negative level as their life force
      drains away.</p>

      <p>If youâ€™re at least 17th level, a creature that fails its saving throw
      takes 2 temporary negative levels instead.</p>
