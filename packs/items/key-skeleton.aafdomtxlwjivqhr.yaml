      <p>Many door locks have a similar design and thus can be unlocked by a
      similar key. A skeleton key may be tried on any standard door lock that
      uses a key, even if you don't have the <em>Disable Device</em> skill. You
      use the key's <em>Disable Device</em> bonus of +10 rather than your own
      total; you cannot take 10 when using a skeleton key. The key only gets one
      roll for any particular lock. If the roll fails, the key is unable to open
      or close that lock. Inferior skeleton keys may only have a +5 bonus.</p>
