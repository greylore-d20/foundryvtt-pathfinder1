    value: >-
      <p>You surround yourself with a palpable aura of draconic fear and dread.
      Living creatures within this aura that are normally immune to fear or
      mind-affecting abilities lose those immunities against your spells,
      spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that create fear effects,
      as well as any Intimidate checks you attempt to demoralize foes.  If you
      have the antipaladin aura of cowardice class feature, this spell instead
      changes the penalty imposed by aura of cowardice to -6 for its
      duration.</p>
