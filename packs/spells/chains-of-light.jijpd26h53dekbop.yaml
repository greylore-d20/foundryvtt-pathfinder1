    value: >-
      <p>A creature targeted by this spell is held immobile by glowing golden
      chains composed of pure light. The creature is paralyzed and held in
      place, but may attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect.
      While held by the golden chains, a creature cannot use any sort of
      extradimensional travel, such as <i>astral projection</i>, <i>blink</i>,
      <i>dimension door</i>, <i>ethereal jaunt</i>, <i>etherealness</i>,
      <i>gate</i>, <i>maze</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>shadow walk</i>,
      <i>teleport</i>, and similar spells and spell-like abilities. The spell
      does not affect creatures that are already in ethereal or astral form when
      the spell is cast.</p>
