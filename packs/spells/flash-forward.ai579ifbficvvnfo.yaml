      <p>You cheat the laws of time and enter into combat before reverting back
      to your original position. As part of the action to cast the spell, you
      make a charge attack against an enemy. You make this charge attack
      normally, accounting for terrain,  obstacles, attacks of opportunity,
      attack rolls, and damage rolls. At the end of your charge action, you
      instantly teleport back to your original location as a free action. Any
      damage or conditions dealt by you or to you during this action are real
      and remain when you return to your original location.</p>
