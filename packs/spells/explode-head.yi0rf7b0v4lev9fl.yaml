    value: >-
      <p>You cause incredible pressure to build in the target's head; this spell
      works only on a creature that has a head and would die from the loss of a
      head. The spell kills any such target that has 20 hit points or fewer,
      exploding its head and spreading debris in a 10-foot radius. Each creature
      in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of
      slashing damage from the flying debris.</p>
