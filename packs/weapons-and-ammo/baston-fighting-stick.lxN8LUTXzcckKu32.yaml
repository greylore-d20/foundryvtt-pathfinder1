      B</p><h3>Description</h3><p>These weapons are treated sticks of wood,
      either left bare or covered in elaborate decorative designs. Baston
      fighting sticks vary in length from 2 to 4 feet, with thicknesses varying
      between 1 to 3 inches. In most applications, these weapons are similar to
      clubs or quarterstaffs, but in the hands of a trained expert, they truly
      shine. A creature with the Combat Reflexes feat treats the weapon as
      having the blocking and performance weapon special features
      (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</em> 22).</p>
