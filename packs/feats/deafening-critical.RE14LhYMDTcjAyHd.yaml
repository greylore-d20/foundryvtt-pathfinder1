      This deafness can be cured by heal, regeneration, remove deafness, or a
      similar ability.<p><b>Special</b><br>You can only apply the effects of one
      critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical
      Mastery.<p><b>Combat Trick</b><br>When you confirm a critical hit and
      attempt to deafen an opponent with this feat, you can spend up to 5
      stamina points to increase the DC of this feat's saving throw by an amount
      equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
