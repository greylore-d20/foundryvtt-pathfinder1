  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian has been marked by the spirits, as indicated by an
      impressive tattoo, scar, or birthmark she possesses. As a swift action,
      she can call upon the spiritsâ€™ favor to increase any d20 roll she just
      made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. This bonus increases by 1
      for every 4 levels she has. She can call on the auspicious mark after
      seeing the result of the d20 roll. This ability can be used only once per
      day.</p>
