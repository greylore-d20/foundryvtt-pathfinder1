      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a mind eyeâ€”a magical sensor through which you can see and hear. The mind eye is invisible and its size is Fine, giving it an AC of 18. Any amount of damage to the eye destroys it, but it can be harmed by only spells or magic weapons. The eye moves with a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability and can travel up to 1 mile away from you.</p>\n<p>You must concentrate as a standard action to direct the eye and receive sensory images through it. The mind eye sees as your eyes see, including any additional senses you possess (such as darkvision or&nbsp;see invisibility). The mind eye lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>"
