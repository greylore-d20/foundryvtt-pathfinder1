  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a darkly sinister floating knife that attacks the same
      creature as you each round. If you choose not to attack a creature, or you
      make an attack that affects multiple opponents, the knife makes no attack
      during that round.</p><p>The knife uses your base attack bonus modified by
      either your Intelligence or Charisma bonus (whichever is higher) when
      making this attack. Unless you specifically will it to do otherwise, or it
      proves impossible to do so, the knife always maneuvers itself so that it
      can flank your opponent before making the attack. The knife deals 1d4
      points of force damage on a successful hit and has the same threat range
      and critical multipliers as a normal dagger. In addition, if the target is
      denied a Dexterity bonus to AC or the knife flanks the target, the knife
      can make sneak attacks as a rogue, inflicting an extra 1d6 points of force
      damage per four caster levels on a successful attack.</p><p>A <i>twilight
      knife</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel
      magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>a sphere of annihilation</i>, or a
      <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>twilight knife</i>'s AC
      against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object) plus your
      Dexterity modifier.</p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance,
      you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell
      resistance the first time the <i>twilight knife</i> strikes it. If the
      knife is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon
      has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the
      spell.</p>
