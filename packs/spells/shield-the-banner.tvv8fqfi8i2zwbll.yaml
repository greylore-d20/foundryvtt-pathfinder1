  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell is used to protect one of a tribe's most valuable possessions:
    its tribal banner. Any creature (other than a member of the tribe which the
    standard represents) attempting to directly attack or touch the standard
    must make a Will save. This spell functions as sanctuary, but only protects
    a standard or banner. In addition, the spell grants a +2 bonus to the
    standard's hardness, and +10 to the standard's hit points for the duration
    of the spell.</p>
