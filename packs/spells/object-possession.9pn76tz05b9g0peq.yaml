    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>lesser object possession</i>, except as
      noted above. The possessed animated object has a number of Construction
      Points appropriate for its size (up to 3 CP for Large objects).  You can
      return your consciousness to your body as a standard action. On your next
      turn, you can attempt to possess a different object as a standard action
      instead of ending the spell.</p>
