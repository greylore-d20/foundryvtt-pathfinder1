          <p>Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power.
          The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods
          and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and
          terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the
          intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is
          the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and
          covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders
          beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a
          particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers,
          others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all
          magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable
          of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world
          to their every desire.</p><p>Role: While universalist wizards might
          study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist
          wizards research schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled
          within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards
          are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming
          any danger.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The wizard’s class skills are
          Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int),
          Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>

      class: wizard
      description:
        value: >-
          <p>At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a
          creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a <em>familiar</em> or
          a bonded object. A <em>familiar</em> is a magical pet that enhances
          the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a
          bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or
          to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is
          permanent and cannot be changed.</p>

          <p>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost.
          Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of
          the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These
          objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level
          are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or
          ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons
          must be held in one hand. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without
          his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a
          <em>concentration</em> check or lose the spell. The DC for this check
          is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet,
          it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.</p>

          <p>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that
          the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the
          spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast
          by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects
          dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by
          <em>metamagic feats</em> or other abilities. The bonded object cannot
          be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see
          <em>arcane school</em> below).</p>

          <p>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as
          if he has the required <em>Item Creation Feats</em> and if he meets
          the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a
          bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the
          dagger (see @Compendium[pf1.feats.4hNO4OAWYF5vXphH]{Craft Magic Arms
          and Armor} feat). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand
          abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed
          and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to
          craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including
          any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard
          who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced,
          the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the
          appropriate type.</p>

          <p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points
          the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an
          arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a
          special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the
          masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced
          in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the
          previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as
          his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or
          destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities
          while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded
          item.</p>

          <p>A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining
          additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be
          made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that
          does not select a school receives the <em>universalist</em> school
          instead.</p>

          <p>A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must
          select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing
          knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in
          another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must
          use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a
          wizard with <em>evocation</em> as an opposition school must expend two
          of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a
          @Compendium[pf1.spells.6oq1wcryviik9ice]{Fireball}. In addition, a
          specialist takes a –4 penalty on any <em>skill checks</em> made when
          crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition
          schools as a prerequisite. A <em>universalist</em> wizard can prepare
          spells from any school without restriction.</p>

          <p>Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In
          addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each
          spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can
          prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell
          must be in the wizard’s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell
          modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it
          uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the
          <em>universalist</em> school do not receive a school slot.</p>

          He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for

          @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.20JWTam2dn7jjZFV]{Arcane
          Schools}) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also
          selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his
          Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard
          level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he
          can cast (based on his new wizard level) for his spellbook. At any
          time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks
          to his own (see Magic).</p>

          <i>You can create magic scrolls.</i><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
          Caster level 1st.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You can create a
          scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes 2 hours if
          its base price is 250 gp or less, otherwise scribing a scroll takes 1
          day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To scribe a scroll, you must
          use up raw materials costing half of this base price. See the magic
          item creation rules in Magic Items for more information.</p>

Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</p><p>Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.</p><p>Spells such as <i>bless</i> that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.</p><p><i>Invisibility</i> can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>"

          of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it

          creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude
          save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to
          the obvious effects, takes a -4 penalty on initiative and has a 20%

          within or through the area of <i>grease</i> at half normal speed with
          a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and
          must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more
          means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that

          <p>Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for
          practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform
          simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have
          severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of
          material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each
          round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It
          cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters.
          Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and
          artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are
          extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell
          components. Finally, prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any
          other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just
          moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.</p>
