      hardened tube that fits over the forearm, ending in a semicircular blade
      used for devastating bladed punch attacks. The scizore grants a +1 shield
      bonus to AC, but if you attack with the blade, you lose the AC bonus that
      round and take a -1 penalty on attack rolls with it. While wearing a
      scizore, you cannot use that hand for anything else. A scizore provides a
      +10 bonus to your CMD against being disarmed of your scizore. Donning a
      scizore is a full-round action.</p>
