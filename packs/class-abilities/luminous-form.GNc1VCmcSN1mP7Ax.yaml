  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can transform your body into churning light, granting you the
      effects of blur and causing your body to shed light as a sunrod.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, creatures that end their turn adjacent to your luminous
      form become blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates).</p>

      <p>At 13th level, creatures that end their turn adjacent to your luminous
      form are blinded for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude reduces to 1 round).</p>

      <p>At 18th level, your luminescence is as bright as natural sunlight, and
      creatures affected by natural sunlight are so affected if they end their
      turn adjacent to your luminous form.</p>

      <p>You can maintain your luminous form for up to 1 minute per day per
      oracle level; this duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in
      1-minute increments. You can forgo the blur and blinding aspects of this
      ability to instead simply shed light as a torch, though this still counts
      against the abilityâ€™s duration for the day.</p>
