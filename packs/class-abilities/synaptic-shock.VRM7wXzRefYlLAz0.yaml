  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The psychic manipulates an enemy’s mind with brute force, causing
      mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point
      from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select
      one of the spell’s targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell,
      that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell
      expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If
      the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead
      confused for 1 round immediately.</p>

      <p>For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she
      can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification
      can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of
      targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune
      to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such
      creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic
      shock applied to it via dual amplification).</p>
