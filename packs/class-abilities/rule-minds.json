      "value": "<p>At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell’s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn’t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as&nbsp;dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can’t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p>"
