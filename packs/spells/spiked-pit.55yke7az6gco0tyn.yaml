      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.8w67l6dzzsi6oz5f]{create pit}, except
      that the pit is lined with wickedly sharp spikes along its bottom and
      walls and has a maximum depth of 50 feet. Creatures who fall into the pit
      take falling damage as normal, plus 2d6 points of piercing damage from the
      spikes. Any creature or object coming into contact with the spikes along
      the walls, such as a creature trying to climb out, or rope or other
      typical aids to climbing, takes 1d6 points of piercing damage each round
      they are in contact with the walls. For those willing to accept the damage
      incurred while climbing, the pit's walls have a Climb DC of 20.</p>
