      <i>You can make a single attack that deals incredible
      damage.</i><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.DorPGQ2mifJbMKH8]{Improved Vital Strike},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital Strike}, base attack
      bonus +16.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: When you use the attack
      action, you can make one attack at your highest base attack bonus that
      deals additional damage. Roll the weapon's damage dice for the attack four
      times and add the results together before adding bonuses from Strength,
      weapon abilities (such as <i>flaming</i>), precision based damage, and
      other damage bonuses. These extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on
      a critical hit, but are added to the total.</p>
