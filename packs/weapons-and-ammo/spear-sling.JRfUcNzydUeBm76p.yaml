  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A spear-sling consists of a hollow tube with a loop of elastic
      material, such as rubber or sinew, attached to one end. The wielder draws
      a harpoon, javelin, shortspear, or spear through the tube, pulling the
      loop taut. Releasing the loop propels the shaft forward like a bow does an
      arrow. A harpoon, javelin, shortspear, spear, or other weapon shot from a
      spear-sling is treated as a projectile weapon instead of a thrown weapon,
      increasing its maximum range and allowing it to be used underwater. Using
      a spear-sling requires two hands. Loading a spear-sling is a standard
      action (a move action if the wielder has the Rapid Reload feat) that
      provokes attacks of opportunity.</p><p>A spear-sling is made with a
      particular strength rating, like a composite longbow. Each point of
      Strength bonus granted by the sling's strength rating adds 50 gp to its
      cost. If you have a negative Strength modifier, apply it to damage rolls
      when you use a spear-sling.</p>
