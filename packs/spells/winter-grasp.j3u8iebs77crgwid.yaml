  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Ice encrusts the ground, radiating supernatural cold and making it hard
    for creatures to maintain their balance. This icy ground is treated as
    normal ice, forcing creatures to spend 2 squares of movement to enter an icy
    square and increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks in the area by 5. A
    creature that begins its turn in the affected area takes 1d6 points of cold
    damage and takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells with the cold
    descriptor for 1 round.</p>
