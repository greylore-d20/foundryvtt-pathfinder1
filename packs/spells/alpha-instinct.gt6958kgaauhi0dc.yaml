  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Animals perceive you as a social superior. The starting attitude of
      animals you interact with improves by one step, and you gain a +2 morale
      bonus on Handle Animal checks. Helpful animals provide simple assistance
      (such as using the aid another action on skill checks they understand) as
      long as the spell lasts, but they flee from attacks and do not support you
      in combat. At one point during the spell's duration, you can issue a
      nonverbal command to helpful animals within 60 feet to forage for you; the
      animal or animals immediately head out into the wilderness to do just
      that. After 1 hour, the animals return to the location where you issued
      the command to make you an offering of edible food sufficient for one meal
      for you and a number of others equal to your caster level.</p>
