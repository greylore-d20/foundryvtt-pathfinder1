      <p>You reduce the target creature's ability to tap into a single energy
      type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) of your choice. This
      reduces damage of the selected type the creature deals with spells,
      spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities by 10 points. Multiple
      castings of this spell stack. Damage from sources other than the creature,
      such as objects and magic items, is not reduced. If the damage of one of
      the creature's effects is negated entirely, any additional effects
      associated with that damage (such being stunned by <i>sound burst</i> o r
      set on fi re by a fi re e lemental) a re also negated. At 13th level, you
      reduce the target's damage by 20 points, and at 19th level, you reduce the
      target's damage by 30 points.  If the target succeeds on its saving throw,
      the spell's duration is reduced to 1 round.</p>
