  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Ironwood</i> is a magical substance created by druids from normal
      wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, <i>ironwood</i> is
      as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal
      or iron do not function on <i>ironwood</i>. Spells that affect wood do
      affect <i>ironwood</i>, although <i>ironwood</i> does not burn. Using this
      spell with <i>wood shape</i> or a wood-related Craft check, you can
      fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate
      armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal
      steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by
      druids.</p><p>Further, if you make only half as much <i>ironwood</i> as
      the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so
      created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
