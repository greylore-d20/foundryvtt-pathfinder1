      <p>This spell functions like <i>detect evil</i>, except that it detects
      only outsiders with the evil subtype, as well as the lingering effects
      caused by their gifts, presence, and spells. It can also detect clerics
      and paladins of fiendish deities, including Asmodeus, archdevils, daemonic
      harbingers, and demon lords.</p>
