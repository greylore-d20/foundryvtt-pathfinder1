  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell makes a single bag, chest, sack, or other container look and
    feel empty. The container must be no larger than 1 cubic foot per caster
    level or the spell fails. Anyone peering into or reaching into the container
    must succeed at a Will save or perceive the container as being completely
    empty. All items within the container when the spell was cast are still
    present, but they can't be noticed unless removed from the bag-such as by
    someone who can perceive them, or who upends the container.  Casting
    <i>vacuous vessel</i> on another container or placing a new item in the
    existing container immediately dismisses the currently active spell.</p>
