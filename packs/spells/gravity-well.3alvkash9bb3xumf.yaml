  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You bring into being a localized region of increased gravity that
      crushes a creature to the ground. Affected targets weigh twice as much as
      normal, can move only at half speed, jump only half as far as normal, and
      can lift and carry only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its
      maneuverability worsened by two steps (from good to poor, for example;
      minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25
      Fly check to remain in the air. <i>Freedom of movement</i> negates the
      effects of this spell. A creature targeted by <i>gravity well</i> behaves
      normally in the area of a <i>reverse gravity</i> spell.</p>
