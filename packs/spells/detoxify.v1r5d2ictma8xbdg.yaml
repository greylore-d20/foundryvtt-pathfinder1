      <p>You remove a creature's ability to poison others, whether inherent or
      via poisoned weapons. Whenever an affected creature would inflict poison
      with an attack, spell, or other method (including auras and other constant
      methods), that poison is automatically neutralized. This does not grant
      the subject of the spell any resistance to poison itself.</p>
