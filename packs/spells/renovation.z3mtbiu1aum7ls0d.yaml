      <p>Upon casting this spell, you permanently rearrange and resize the rooms
      in a building you constructed as a downtime activity (see page 84 of
      <i>Ultimate</i> Campaign). You may reorganize and remap the building
      however you please, as if each room had just been constructed and is being
      positioned for the first time. You cannot make any changes to a building
      that changes how much a room would cost to create or that alters the
      benefits a room provides. The structure also must remain in the same
      general position within the district. If you don't wholly own the
      structure, all of the structure's owners must consent to the changes being
      made before the spell is cast; otherwise, it fails immediately.</p>
