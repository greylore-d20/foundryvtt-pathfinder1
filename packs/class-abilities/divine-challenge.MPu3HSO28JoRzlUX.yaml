    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you can challenge a visible foe within 30 feet,
      gaining a +1 sacred bonus to your AC against that creatureâ€™s attacks and a
      bonus equal to 1/2 your cleric level on Bluff skill checks to feint
      against it. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
      cleric level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to
      3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Battle Rage power of the War Domain.</p>
