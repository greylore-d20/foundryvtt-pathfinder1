    value: >-
      <p>When a rogue selects this talent, she must choose the confused, shaken,
      or sickened condition. When the rogue has the selected condition and hits
      a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the rogue
      no longer has that condition. A rogue can take this talent up to three
      times. Each time, she must select a different condition that she is able
      to remove from herself with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage.
      Even if the rogue has taken this talent multiple times, she can remove
      only a single effect on herself with each melee attack that deals sneak
      attack damage.</p>
