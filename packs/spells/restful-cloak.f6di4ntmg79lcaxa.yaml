  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A cloak you are wearing transforms into a canvas tent large enough to
      hold four Medium creatures, firmly pitched in a flat area adjacent to you
      (if there is no such area, this spell simply fails). A creature regains 1
      hit point for each hour it rests in the tent, in addition to any other
      benefits of resting. Additionally, a fatigued creature resting within the
      tent for 1 hour loses the fatigued condition, but a creature cannot
      recover from being fatigued more than once per casting of <i>restful
      tent</i>. At the end of the spell's duration, the tent transforms back
      into a cloak. If the tent is moved prior to the expiration of the spell's
      duration, the spell immediately ends.</p>
