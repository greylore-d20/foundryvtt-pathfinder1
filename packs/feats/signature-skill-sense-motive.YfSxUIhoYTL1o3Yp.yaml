      were aware of an opponent before rolling initiative (such as when you
      ambush an enemy or negotiations break down into combat, but not when both
      sides happen upon each other or you are surprised), you can attempt a
      Sense Motive check as part of your initiative check (DC = 11 + the highest
      Bluff modifier among your opponents or DC 15, whichever is higher). If you
      succeed, you gain a +1 bonus on the initiative check, plus an additional
      +1 for every 5 by which you exceeded the DC.</p><p><strong>10
      Ranks</strong>: After 1 minute of conversation, you can read a creature’s
      surface thoughts (as detect thoughts) by attempting a Sense Motive check
      at a –20 penalty opposed by the creature’s Bluff check.</p><p><strong>15
      Ranks</strong>: You can read surface thoughts as above after 1 round. In
      addition, when attacked, you can attempt a Sense Motive check as an
      immediate action opposed by your target’s attack roll. A successful check
      grants a +2 insight bonus to your AC against attacks from that specific
      opponent for 1 minute.</p><p><strong>20 Ranks</strong>: You can read
      surface thoughts as above as a standard action. A successful check to gain
      an insight bonus to your AC also negates the attack that triggered it.</p>
