      <p>You become warded against the mental prying of others, including the
      effects of divination spells such as <i>detect thoughts</i> and <i>seek
      thoughts</i>, as well as enchantment spells such as <i>modify memory</i>
      and <i>memory lapse</i>. If another creature attempts to target you with a
      mind-affecting spell that  detects or alters your thoughts or memories,
      the caster must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 +
      your caster level or the spell fails. Only spells that detect or alter
      your thoughts or memories are blocked by this spell; effects such as
      <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>, <i>detect evil</i> , and <i>locate
      creature</i> continue to affect you as normal.</p>
