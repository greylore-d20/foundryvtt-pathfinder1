When exposed to air, the moldable substance quickly creates a thin, paper-like surface, which is ideal for creating false earthen walls. Creating a 5-foot-by-5-foot section of paper wall requires a <em>full-round action</em>. Though this false wall is easy to punch through, it requires a successful DC 13 <em>Perception</em> check to identify the wall as a fake. If the creator of the paper wall spends an additional <em>full-round action</em> disguising the wall with dirt and pebbles, the DC increases by 2.</p>\n<p><b>Create</b>: <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC 15</p>"
