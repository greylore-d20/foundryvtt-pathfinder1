    value: >-
      <p>You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any
      suitable writing material. The <i>illusory script</i> appears to be some
      form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated
      by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's
      unintelligible to any other character.</p><p>Any unauthorized creature
      attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must
      make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look
      away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature
      is subject to a <i>suggestion</i> implanted in the script by you at the
      time the <i>illusory script</i> spell was cast. The <i>suggestion</i>
      lasts only 30 minutes. Typical <i>suggestion</i>s include "Close the book
      and leave," "Forget the existence of this note," and so forth. If
      successfully dispelled by <i>dispel magic,</i> the <i>illusory script</i>
      and its secret message disappear.</p><p>The hidden message can be read by
      a combination of the <i>true seeing</i> spell with the <i>read magic</i>
      or <i>comprehend languages</i> spell.</p>
