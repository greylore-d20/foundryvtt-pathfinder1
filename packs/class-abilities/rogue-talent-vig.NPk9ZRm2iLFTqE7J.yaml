    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante gains a single rogue talent (not an advanced talent) of
      his choice. If he selects a rogue talent marked with an asterisk (*), that
      talent applies to his hidden strikes instead of to sneak attacks, and the
      talent counts as a stalker vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) for the
      limitation of only one applying to a given hidden strike. Only a stalker
      vigilante can select this talent.</p>
