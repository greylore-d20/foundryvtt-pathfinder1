  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You trade places with the other target, teleporting as if you were both
      affected by dimension door. Both you and the other target arrive in a
      square you choose in the other's former space. If the targets are
      different sizes, they must appear in locations that cover previously
      occupied squares. As with dimension door, after casting this spell, you
      can't take any other actions until your next turn, and the other target is
      staggered until the end of its next turn due to the transposition.</p>
