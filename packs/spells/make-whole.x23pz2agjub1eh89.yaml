      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.24zg8a05hqum3e6j]{mending}, except that
      it repairs 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on an object or
      construct creature (maximum 5d6).</p><p><em>Make whole</em> can fix
      destroyed magic items (at 0 hit points or less), and restores the magic
      properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the
      item. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as
      potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. When <em>make
      whole</em> is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any
      immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.</p>
