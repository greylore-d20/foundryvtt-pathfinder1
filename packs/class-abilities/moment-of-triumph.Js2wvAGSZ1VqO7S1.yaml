  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, the cavalier can, as a free action, declare a moment of
      triumph. For 1 round, the cavalier receives a competence bonus equal to
      his Charisma modifier on all ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls,
      saving throws, and skill checks. This bonus is also added to his AC. In
      addition, any critical threats he makes are automatically confirmed. The
      cavalier can use this ability once per day.</p>
