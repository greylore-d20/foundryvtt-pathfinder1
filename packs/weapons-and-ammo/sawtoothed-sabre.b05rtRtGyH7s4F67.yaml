  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Crafted to evoke the barbed talons of the Mantis God himself, a
      sawtooth sabre may be used as a Martial Weapon (in which case it functions
      identically to a longsword). If you have the Exotic Weapon Proficiency
      (sawtooth sabre) feat, for the purpose of two-weapon fighting you can
      treat it as a light melee weapon; for all other purposes, it is a
      one-handed melee weapon.</p>
