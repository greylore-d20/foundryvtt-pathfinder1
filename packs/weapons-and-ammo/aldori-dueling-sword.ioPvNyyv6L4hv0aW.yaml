  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These slightly curved swords measure just over 3 feet in length. An
      Aldori dueling sword can be used as a martial weapon (in which case it
      functions as a longsword), but if you have the feat Exotic Weapon
      Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword), you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to
      apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack
      rolls with an Aldori dueling sword sized for you, even though it isn't a
      light weapon. You can also wield an Aldori dueling sword in two hands to
      apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage rolls.</p>
