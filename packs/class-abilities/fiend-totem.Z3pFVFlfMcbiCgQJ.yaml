  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian sprouts dozens of wicked barbs from her
      body. Anyone striking the barbarian with a melee weapon, an unarmed
      strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. A
      barbarian must have the lesser fiend totem rage power to select this rage
      power.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
