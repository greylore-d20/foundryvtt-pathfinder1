Further details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of Golarion.</em></p><p>This spell enhances the targetâ€™s dwarven or dwarf-like qualities, making it appear more attractive, personable, and worthy of respect and admiration by dwarves. The target is still recognizable as itself. The target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to influence dwarves (such as Diplomacy, Intimidate, and so on).</p>"
