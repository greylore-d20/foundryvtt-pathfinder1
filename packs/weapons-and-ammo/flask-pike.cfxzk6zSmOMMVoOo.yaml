      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This pike has a hollow spot near its tip into
      which a flask can be strapped. If the flask is filled with an alchemical
      splash weapon and you hit a creature with the pike, the target is also hit
      with the splash weapon. This uses up the contents of the flask. Because of
      the added weight of a flask, attacks with the flask pike take a -2 penalty
      when it's loaded with one. Reloading the flask pike is a full-round action
      that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
