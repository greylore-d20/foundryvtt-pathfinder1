    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you gain the power of genies to grant wishes. Once per
      day, you can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.s2p7a4biy7bl4ks2]{Limited Wish}
      as a <em>spell-like ability</em>. Such wishes must begin with the words “I
      wish,” and cannot duplicate a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.nnj51dwfkwd15ngj]{Wish} you have granted within the
      past 24 hours. If you use this ability to duplicate a spell with a costly
      material component, you must provide that component.</p>

      <p>You become immune to cold damage, and can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.q3st18udsalnyz5v]{Plane Shift} once per day to
      travel to or from the Plane of Water.</p>
