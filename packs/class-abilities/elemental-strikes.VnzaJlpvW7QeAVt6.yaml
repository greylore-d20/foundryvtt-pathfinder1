      <p>At 1st level, three times a day as a swift action you can imbue your
      melee attacks with elemental energy. For 1 round, your melee attacks deal
      1d6 points of additional damage of your energy type.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, you can use this ability up to five times per day.</p>

      <p>At 20th level, all your melee attacks deal this damage, and this
      ability no longer requires a swift action to activate.</p>
