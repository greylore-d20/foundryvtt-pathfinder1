  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>summon swarm</i>, except that living and
    undead creatures that fail their saving throw against the swarm's
    distraction find that their limbs twist and spasm, as their bodies become
    susceptible to transmutations. Such creatures take a -4 penalty to Dexterity
    and on saving throws against transmutation effects for 1 hour per caster
    level.</p>
