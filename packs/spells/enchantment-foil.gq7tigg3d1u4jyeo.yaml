    value: >-
      <p>You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. If
      you succeed at a save against an enchantment effect, you identify the
      effect as if you had succeeded at a Spellcraft check to do so.
      Furthermore, you can choose to act as if you had failed your saving throw.
      If you do so, you gain a +20 bonus on Bluff checks to convince others that
      you failed your save and are under the enchantment's effects. A creature
      that attempts to use magic to detect this ruse or to make you speak
      truthfully about it must succeed at a caster level check (DC 15 + your
      caster level) to do so.</p>
