      "value": "<p>The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject is under an effect such as the fascinated condition or magical slumber as per the&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;spell that would be ended by the subject taking damage or by an obvious threat. The trick sends a momentary phantom threat and sensation of pain, ending the effect. This ability works fast enough to prevent a sleeping creature from falling prone or dropping what it is holding, if the mesmerist uses it immediately.</p>\n<p>The mesmerist can also trigger the trick if the subject becomes confused as per&nbsp;confusion, but if he does so, the subject attacks the mesmerist on its next turn, as if the mesmerist attacked the subject.</p>"
