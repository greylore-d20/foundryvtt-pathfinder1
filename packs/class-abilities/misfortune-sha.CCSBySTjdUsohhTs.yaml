  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune
      for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an ability check, attack roll,
      saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse
      result. A successful Will saving throw negates this hex.</p>

      <p>At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1
      round. This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the
      target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
