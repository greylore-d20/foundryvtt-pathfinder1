      one-handed weapon with a revolving cylinder containing six chambers. Each
      chamber holds a special radium-powder cartridge, and when one cartridge is
      fired, the cylinder automatically rotates (no extra hand or action
      required). readying the next cartridge for firing.</p><h3>Radium
      Weapons</h3><p>Barsoomian firearms are stocked with rare local woods.
      Metal components consist of an alloy of aluminum and steel that exceeds
      the strength of Earth metals (giving Barsoomian firearms a hardness of
      12). Radium weapons fire special cartridges that must be manufactured
      under artificial light, as exposure to sunlight results in an explosion.
      When the cartridges strike their target they shatter exposing the radium
      powder within. The moment sunlight strikes this substance it explodes with
      considerable violence, making the weapons versatile for either direct fire
      or suppressive fire. Radium weapons follow the general rules for advanced
      firearms found in <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate
      Combat</em>.</p><p>All radium weapons use radium cartridges for
      ammunition. As a result. in addition to targeting specific creatures or
      objects. the wielder may fire a radium weapon at an unoccupied square
      similar to throwing a splash weapon (<em>Pathfinder RFC Core Rulebook
      202</em>). All creatures within 15 feet of the targeted square take 2d6
      points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (Reflex DC 15 half).
      Radium cartridge damage does not change based on the size of the weapon
      used to fire them. Radium cartridges cannot be fired effectively in this
      way outside the rays of the sun, such as underground or at night. Radium
      cartridges cost 3 gp per cartridge.</p>
