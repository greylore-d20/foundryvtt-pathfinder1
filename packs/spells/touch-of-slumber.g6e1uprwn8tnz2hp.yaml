    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions only against a creature with an attitude toward
      you of indifferent or better, and only if the target is not hostile toward
      you or your visible allies. A target touched by you (this touch usually
      requires a successful melee touch attack) must succeed at a Will saving
      throw or fall asleep for 2d6 hours. While asleep, the creature is
      helpless. For 1 minute after the creature is affected, any loud noise or
      rough contact causes it to awaken immediately. Thereafter, slapping or
      wounding an affected creature awakens it, but normal noise does not.
      Awakening a creature is a standard action (this is an application of the
      aid another action).</p>
