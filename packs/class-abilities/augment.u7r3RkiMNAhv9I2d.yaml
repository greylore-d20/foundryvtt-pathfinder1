  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a <em>standard action</em>, you can touch a creature and grant it
      either a +2 <em>enhancement bonus</em> to a single ability score of your
      choice or a +1 bonus to <em>natural armor</em> that stacks with any
      <em>natural armor</em> the creature might possess. At 10th level, the
      <em>enhancement bonus</em> to one ability score increases to +4. The
      <em>natural armor bonus</em> increases by +1 for every five wizard levels
      you possess, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. This augmentation lasts a
      number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1 round). You can
      use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>
