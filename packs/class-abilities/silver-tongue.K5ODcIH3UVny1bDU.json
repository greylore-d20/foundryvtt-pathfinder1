      "value": "<p>At 1st level, you can draw upon your <em>outsider</em> heritage to spin amazingly convincing lies. Activating this ability is a <em>swift action</em>. You gain a +5 bonus on one <em>Bluff</em> check made to convince another of the truth of your words (similar to using <em>glibness</em>). If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on a <em>caster level</em> check (DC 10 + your sorcerer level) to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier.</p>"
