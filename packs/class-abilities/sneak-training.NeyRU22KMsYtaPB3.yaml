    value: >-
      <p>The character counts as having the sneak attack class feature of a character of
      her level for the purpose of meeting prestige class requirements, although
      this talent doesn’t improve the character’s existing sneak attack ability or
      grant her the sneak attack class feature if she doesn’t already have it.
      This talent is most useful for rogues that lack the sneak attack class
      feature, such as those with the <em>phantom thief</em> archetype.</p>
