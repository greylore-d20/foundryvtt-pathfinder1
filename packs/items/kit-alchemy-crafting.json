      "value": "<p>An @Compendium[pf1.classes.JcaqlAawhf14q1lq]{Alchemist} with an alchemy crafting kit is assumed to have all the material <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a> needed for his extracts, mutagens, and bombs, except for those <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a> that have a specific cost. An alchemy crafting kit provides no bonuses on @Compendium[pf1.skills.L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE]{Craft (alchemy)} checks. (This item was previously called an \"alchemist's kit\", and was renamed to avoid confusion with the set of adventuring gear called an \"alchemist's kit.\")</p>"
