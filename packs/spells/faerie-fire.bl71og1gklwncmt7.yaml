  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed
      light as candles. Creatures outlined by <i>faerie fire</i> take a -20
      penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the
      concealment normally provided by <i>darkness</i> (though a 2nd-level or
      higher magical <i>darkness</i> effect functions normally), <i>blur</i>,
      <i>displacement</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, or similar effects. The light is
      too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures
      vulnerable to light. The <i>faerie fire</i> can be blue, green, or violet,
      according to your choice at the time of casting. The <i>faerie fire</i>
      does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.</p>
