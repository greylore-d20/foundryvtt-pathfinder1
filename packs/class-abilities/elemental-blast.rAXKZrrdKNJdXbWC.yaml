  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you can unleash a blast of elemental power once per day.
      This 20-foot-radius burst does 1d6 points of damage of your energy type
      per sorcerer level. Those caught in the area of your blast receive a
      <em>Reflex</em> save for half damage. Creatures that fail their saves gain
      vulnerability to your energy type until the end of your next turn. The DC
      of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your
      <em>Charisma</em> modifier. At 9th level, you can use this ability once
      per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th
      level, you can use this ability three times per day. This power has a
      range of 60 feet.</p>
