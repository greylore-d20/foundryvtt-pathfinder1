  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The bow that is touched takes on the rigidity and toughness of forged
    steel, allowing it to be used as a melee weapon. The spell allows a shortbow
    to be used as a club or a longbow to be used as a quarterstaff, although the
    bow retains its normal hit points and hardness. The bow's enhancement bonus,
    if any, applies on melee attack and damage rolls. Additional weapon special
    weapon qualities also apply to melee attacks if such qualities can be added
    to a melee weapon.</p>
