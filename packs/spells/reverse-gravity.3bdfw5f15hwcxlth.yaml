  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached objects and
    creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1
    round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall,
    falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would
    during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of
    the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly,
    until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and
    creatures fall downward.</p><p>Provided it has something to hold onto, a
    creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself when
    the spell strikes.</p><p>Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep
    themselves from falling.</p>
