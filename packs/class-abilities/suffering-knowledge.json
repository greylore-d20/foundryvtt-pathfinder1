When the arcanist fails a saving throw against a spell cast by an enemy, as an immediate action she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to temporarily acquire the spell. She can cast the spell using her spell slots as if it was a spell she had prepared that day. The spell must be on the sorcerer/wizard spell list and must be of a level that she can cast.</p>\n<p>The ability to cast this spell remains for a number of rounds equal to the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modif ier (minimum 1).</p>"
