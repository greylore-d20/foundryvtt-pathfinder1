    value: >-
      <p>You cause an object to briefly transform into gold. Affected items gain
      the properties of gold (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</i> 53) until
      the spell expires. Weapons reduce their hardness by half and gain the
      fragile quality, while piercing and slashing weapons take a -2 penalty on
      damage rolls (minimum 1 damage). This spell increases the affected item's
      armor check penalty by 2 and decreases its armor or shield bonus by 2.
      Gold armor has hardness 5.</p>
