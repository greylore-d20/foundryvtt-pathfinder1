  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Instant restoration</i> channels planar energy into a summoned
      creature. This spell can be cast as an immediate action when a summoned
      creature you control drops to 0 or fewer hit points. Rather than
      immediately disappear, the creature is healed for 4d8 hp + 1 hit point per
      caster level (maximum 4d8+10 hit points). If this healing brings your
      summoned creature's hit point total to 1 or more hit points, it remains as
      if its hit points had never dropped to 0 or fewer. Creatures slain by
      death effects cannot be saved by <i>instant restoration</i>. A summoner
      can target his eidolon with this spell.</p>
