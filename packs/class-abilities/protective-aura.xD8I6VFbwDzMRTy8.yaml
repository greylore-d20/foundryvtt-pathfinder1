  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot protective aura as a standard
      action. Allies in this aura receive a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2
      resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, allies in the area
      gain the benefits of protection from evil (although the AC bonus and
      saving throw bonus do not stack with those granted by this effect). You
      can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric
      level. These rounds do not have to be consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Holy Lance power of the Good Domain.</p>
