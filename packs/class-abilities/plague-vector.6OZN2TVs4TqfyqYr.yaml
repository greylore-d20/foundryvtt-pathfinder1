      <p>The effects of the alchemist’s
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.NYCJPKxtOT6baDxb]{plague bomb}
      operate as normal except for the following changes. The chosen disease’s
      save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + his Intelligence
      modifier. Any creatures affected by the chosen disease become vectors for
      it, spreading the disease to any creatures they come in physical contact
      with for a number of days equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier
      (minimum 1). The save DC to avoid contracting the disease from the vector
      is the same as the DC used for this discovery.</p><p>An alchemist must be
      at least 14th level and must have the plague bomb discovery to select this
      discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
      <em>bomb</em> class feature</p>
