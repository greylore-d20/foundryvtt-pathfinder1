      <p>This spell functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ik9u3eel5vfwrtb5]{Grease}, except as noted here.
      When you use this spell to cover a solid surface with slippery
      <em>grease</em>, the 10-foot squares must form a continuous area, each
      part of which must be within the spell's range. When you use this spell to
      create a greasy coating on items, no two of the targeted items can be more
      than 30 feet apart. You cannot target both items and surfaces with a
      single casting of this spell.</p>
