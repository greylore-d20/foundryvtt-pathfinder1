    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from Table: Ranger
      Favored Terrains. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on <em>initiative</em>
      checks and <em>Knowledge</em> (geography), <em>Perception</em>,
      <em>Stealth</em>, and <em>Survival</em> <em>skill checks</em> when he is
      in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his <em>favored terrain</em>
      normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a
      trail if he so chooses).</p>

      <p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an
      additional <em>favored terrain</em>. In addition, at each such interval,
      the skill bonus and <em>initiative</em> bonus in any one <em>favored
      terrain</em> (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases
      by +2.</p>

      <p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of <em>favored
      terrain</em>, the rangerâ€™s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever
      bonus is higher.</p>
