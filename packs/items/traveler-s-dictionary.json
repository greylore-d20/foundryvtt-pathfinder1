      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Traveler's Dictionary</b> Each of these books references a specific language and has two sections. The first presents a wide variety of useful phrases and words in Common (arranged by category) followed by a phonetic representation of the same in the language that the book deals with. The second section provides an alphabetical (by phonetic spelling) collection of words and phrases in the second language and their approximate Common translation. Using this book does not grant a bonus on rolls to communicate, but at the GM's discretion it can negate or reduce a penalty if the other creature is patient enough to wait for the translation. <b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>\r\n"
