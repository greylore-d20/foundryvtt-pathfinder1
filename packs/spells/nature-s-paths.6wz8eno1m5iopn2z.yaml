  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target instinctively knows the shortest, easiest, and fastest way
    through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the
    target treats any trackless terrain as though there were a trail or road,
    and any terrain with a road or trail as though there were a highway
    (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 171-172). Up to one creature per caster
    level traveling with the target can also benefit from the effect. The spell
    functions only outdoors and does not function in magically altered
    terrain.</p>
