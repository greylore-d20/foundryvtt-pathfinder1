  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can use your <em>supernatural insight</em> to hijack
      the fortunes of a single target within 30 feet. For 1 round, the target
      becomes <em>confused</em> and cannot directly control its actions
      (<em>Will</em> negates). Once a creature has been affected by twisted
      fortune, it is immune to the abilityâ€™s effects for 24 hours. You can use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Cha</em>
      modifier.</p>
