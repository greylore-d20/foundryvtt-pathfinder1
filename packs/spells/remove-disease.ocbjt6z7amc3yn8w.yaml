      <p><i>Remove disease</i> can cure all diseases from which the subject is
      suffering. You must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)
      against the DC of each disease affecting the target. Success means that
      the disease is cured. The spell also kills some hazards and parasites,
      including green slime and others.</p><p>Since the spell's duration is
      instantaneous, it does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the
      same disease at a later date.</p>
