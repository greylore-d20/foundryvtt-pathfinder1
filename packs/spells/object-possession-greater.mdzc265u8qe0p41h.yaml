      <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.9pn76tz05b9g0peq]{Object
      Possession}, except as noted above. The possessed animated object has a
      number of Construction Points appropriate for its size (up to 5 CP for
      Gargantuan objects). Your silver cord extends to medium range (100 ft. +
      10 ft./level). You can attempt to possess a construct instead of an
      unattended object as your first possession with this spell. If you do,
      this spell acts as @Compendium[pf1.spells.cqjtlth3uqafuwnn]{Control
      Construct}, except as noted above.</p>
