      "value": "<p>At 15th level, an order of the eel cavalier can form a pact to share danger with an ally. As a full-round action, the cavalier enters into this pact with a willing creature that has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The cavalier and his partner each gain a deflection bonus to AC equal to the cavalierâ€™s Charisma modifier (minimum +1). A partner that takes damage from attacks and effects that deal hit point damage (including from special abilities) takes only half damage, and the other half of the damage is dealt to the other partner in the pact. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, ability score damage and drain, negative levels, and death effects, are not affected. If either partner in the pact suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split, as it is not hit point damage. This effect ends if the cavalier makes a new pact (at which point the existing pact immediately ends), if the partners in the pact move more than 1,000 feet apart, or if either partner in the pact takes a swift action to dissolve the partnership. Damage already divided is not reassigned when the pact ends.</p>"
