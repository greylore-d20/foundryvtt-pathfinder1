    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, your precision in combat has become incredible, and you
      can strike a lethal blow if your target cannot defend itself properly.
      Once per day, you can make an attack as a standard action against your
      chosen victim. If the attack hits and the victim is denied its Dexterity
      bonus to AC against you, any critical threats are automatically
      confirmed.</p>
