      <p><b>Element</b> air, fire, water; <b>Type</b> substance infusion;
      <b>Level</b> 2; <b>Burn</b> 2<br><b>Associated Blasts</b> blue flame,
      cold, electric, fire<br><b>Saving Throw</b> none</p>

      <p>The intensity of your blasts allows you to break through your foes’
      resistances. Treat your foe’s cold, electricity, or fire resistance as if
      it were 5 lower for the purpose of determining the infused blast’s damage;
      this doesn’t stack with the reduction from searing flame.</p>

      <p>You can increase the burn cost of this infusion to further reduce the
      foe’s resistance against the infused blast by 5 per additional point of
      burn accepted. This has no effect on creatures with immunity.</p>
