That foe is dazed for 1 round if the number of Hit Dice it possesses is less than or equal to or your occultist level. If it has more Hit Dice than your occultist level, it is staggered for 1 round instead. The foe can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect.</p>\n<p>Whether or not it succeeds at the save, the target is then immune to this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>"
