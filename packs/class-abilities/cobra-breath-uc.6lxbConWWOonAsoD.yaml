  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever a monk with this ki power uses diamond body to neutralize a
      poison, he can instead release that poison as a ranged touch attack
      against a single foe within 30 feet. If the attack hits, the foe must
      succeed at a saving throw (using the poison’s original DC) or suffer the
      poison’s effects, even if it was not originally a contact poison.</p>

      <p>A monk must be at least 12th level and must possess the diamond body ki
      power before selecting this ki power.</p>
