      <p>This spell functions as <i>symbol of death</i>, except it instead
      creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the
      symbol. These duplicates function as <i>mirror image</i>, moving with the
      original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions
      exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the
      creature's turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within
      60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered,
      the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Symbol
      of mirroring</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a
      caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.</p>
