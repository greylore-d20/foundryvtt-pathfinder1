  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to set a
      ward about an area. This area has a maximum radius of 10 feet + 5 feet per
      occultist level you possess.</p>

      <p>Whenever a creature enters the area, a sentry manifested by your psyche
      appears and strikes out at the intruder. The affected creature must
      succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. You are immediately aware
      of the sentryâ€™s activation. The sentry lasts for up to 1 hour per
      occultist level you possess, or until triggered.</p>

      <p>When you set the sentry, you can set any number of specific creatures
      to be immune to the sentry and thus avoid triggering it.</p>
