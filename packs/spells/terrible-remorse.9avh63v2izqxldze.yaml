    value: >-
      <p>You fill a target with such profound remorse that it begins to harm
      itself. Each round, the target must save or deal 1d8 points of damage +
      its Strength modifier to itself using an item held in its hand or with
      unarmed attacks. If the creature saves, it is staggered for 1 round and
      takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class, after which the spell ends.</p>
