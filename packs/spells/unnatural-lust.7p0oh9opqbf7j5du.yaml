  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your target is filled with lust and desire for a single creature or
      object as designated by you at the time of casting. That creature or
      object must be within the spell's range and perceivable by the target of
      the spell. The target is filled with the compulsion to rush to the subject
      of its lust and passionately kiss or caress that subject on its next turn,
      taking no other actions. If the target would not normally have lustful
      feelings toward the designated creature or object, it receives a +4 bonus
      on its saving throw.</p>
