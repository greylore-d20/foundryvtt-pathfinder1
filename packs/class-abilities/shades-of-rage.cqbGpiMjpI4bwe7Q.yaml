  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, whenever you enter a bloodrage, the light level within 30
      feet of you decreases by one step. Natural light is always affected, but
      magical illumination dispels this ability if the caster of the light
      effect succeeds at a caster level check against a DC equal to 10 + your
      class level.</p>
