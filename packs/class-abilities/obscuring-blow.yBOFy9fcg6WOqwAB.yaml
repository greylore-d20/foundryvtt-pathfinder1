      <p>Once per day, the character can forgo her potential to deal sneak
      attack damage to attempt to cloud an opponentâ€™s vision. She must declare
      the use of obscuring blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits,
      it does normal damage but, instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and any
      effect that triggers when the character deals sneak attack damage), the
      target treats all other creatures as if they had concealment, suffering a
      20% miss chance on all attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to half
      the class level. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces this effect
      to 1 round. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the class
      level + the character's Intelligence modifier.</p>
