    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on <em>Reflex</em> saves to
      avoid traps and a +1 <em>dodge bonus</em> to AC against attacks made by
      traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on <em>Perception</em> checks to
      avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue
      levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>

      <p>This ability counts as <em>trap sense</em> for the purpose of any feat
      or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature
      that replaces <em>trap sense</em>. The bonuses gained from this ability
      stack with those gained from <em>trap sense</em> (from another class).</p>
