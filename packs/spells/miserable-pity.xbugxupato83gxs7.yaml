      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.yk5bgi6j9kbtigof]{sanctuary}, except
      creatures attempting to attack the target who fail their saves also feel a
      strong sense of pity toward the target, as if it were weak, pathetic, and
      not a threat. If the target breaks the spell by attacking, any creature
      that failed its save against the spell gains a +2 morale bonus on attack
      rolls against the target for 1 minute.</p>
