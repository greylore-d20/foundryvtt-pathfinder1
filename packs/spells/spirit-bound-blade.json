    "shortDescription": "<p>You focus emotional energy and weave it into a shroud of hardened ectoplasm around the weapon you touch, infusing it with a ghostly glow and great power. The weapon becomes a <i>ghost touch</i> weapon, and gains one of the following additional benefits, depending on the type of emotion you  infuse into the weapon. If a special ability wouldn't apply to the chosen weapon (such as <i>vicious</i> on a ranged weapon), the weapon doesn't gain that benefit.  <b>Anger</b>: The weapon also gains the <i>vicious</i> special ability.  <b>Dedication</b>: The weapon also gains the <i>returning</i> special ability.  <b>Despair</b>: The weapon also gains the cruelUE special ability.  <b>Fear</b>: The weapon also gains the menacingUE special ability.  <b>Hatred</b>: The weapon also gains the cunningUE special ability.  <b>Jealousy</b>: The weapon also gains the mimeticUE special ability.  <b>Zeal</b>: The weapon also gains the <i>keen</i> special ability.  If you are a spiritualist and the type of emotional energy you choose matches the emotional focus of your phantom, the weapon grants its wielder a +2 bonus on skill checks with both skills you gain Skill Focus in from your phantom's emotional focus.</p>",
