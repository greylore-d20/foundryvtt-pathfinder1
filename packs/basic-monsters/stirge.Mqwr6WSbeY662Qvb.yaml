          <p>When a stirge hits with a touch attack, its barbed legs latch onto
          the target, anchoring it in place. An attached stirge is effectively
          grappling its prey. The stirge loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has
          an AC of 12, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its
          proboscis into the grappled target’s flesh. A stirge has a +8 racial
          bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An
          attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself—if its
          prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it,
          the stirge is removed.</p>

          <p>A stirge drains blood at the end of its turn if it is attached to a
          foe, inflicting 1 point of Constitution damage. Once a stirge has
          dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies off to
          digest the meal. If its victim dies before the stirge's appetite has
          been sated, the stirge detaches and seeks a new target.</p>

          <p>Due to the stagnant swamps in which they live and their contact
          with the blood of numerous creatures, stirges are harbingers of
          disease. Any creature subjected to a stirge's blood drain attack has a
          10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a
          similar disease. Once this check is made, the victim can no longer be
          infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different
          stirges are resolved normally and may result in multiple
          illnesses.</p>

          <p>This special sense allows a creature to detect approaching enemies,
          sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the
          scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar
          sights.</p><p>The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by
          sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60
          feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke
          or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above.
          Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be
          detected at triple the normal range.</p><p>When a creature detects a
          scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its
          presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a move action
          to note the direction of the scent. When the creature is within 5 feet
          of the source, it pinpoints the source’s location.</p><p>A creature
          with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, attempting a Wisdom
          or Survival check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a
          fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent).
          This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s
          odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each
          hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. Creatures tracking
          by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
          The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival
          skill.</p><p><em>Format:</em> scent</p><p><em>Location:</em>

    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>Stirges are vicious, blood-drinking swamp pests that prey on wild
        animals, livestock, and unwary travelers. While weak individually,
        swarms of the creatures are capable of draining a man dry in minutes,
        leaving only a desiccated husk in their wake.</p><p>Closer to mammals
        than insects, stirges carry their bodies through the air on four fleshy
        wings, searching out warm-blooded prey. They are fond of hiding near
        watering holes and waiting for travelers to drop their guard, then
        swooping out to attach and drink their fill by thrusting their long
        feeding tubes into unprotected veins. After feeding they flap heavily
        off into the mud and reeds to lay their eggs and rest until hunger
        drives them to hunt again.</p><p>Stirges are usually 1 foot long, with a
        wingspan of twice that, and weigh just under a pound. Their coloration
        is rust-red or reddish-brown with a dirty yellow underbelly, though
        stirges that have not fed in some time are often pale pink, their color
        deepening as they gorge.</p>
