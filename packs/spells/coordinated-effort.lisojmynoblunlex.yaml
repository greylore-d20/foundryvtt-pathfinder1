  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Choose a single teamwork feat that you possess. You forge a link with
      your allies, allowing them to gain the benefits of the chosen feat even if
      they do not have it themselves. You must be a part of the group qualifying
      for a given bonus for your allies to gain the benefits. For example, two
      of your allies flanking an orc would gain no benefit from your Outflank
      feat, but an ally flanking the orc with you would. Your allies'
      positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the
      teamwork feat for either of you to receive the listed bonus.</p>
