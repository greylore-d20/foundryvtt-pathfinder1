  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The monk gives a sharp blow to the back of a foeâ€™s head. The critical
      threat range and critical multiplier of this strike increase by 1, and the
      monk gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls to confirm a critical hit with this
      strike. This increase is not doubled by
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.TbOPtIL8Fv8obXtP]{Improved Critical} or similar
      effects. Creatures without a discernible head are unaffected by this style
      strike (subject to GM discretion).</p>

      <p>The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.</p>
