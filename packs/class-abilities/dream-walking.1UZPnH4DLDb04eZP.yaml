    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, you can enter the ethereal plane. This functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.btccs4sjo2nog1a0]{Ethereal Jaunt}, but with a
      duration of 1 minute for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess. Once during
      this trip, you may cast
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.siv3ub7hbmcklf8c]{Nightmare} as a <em>spell-like
      ability</em> on a creature you see on the Material Plane. (This is an
      exception to the normal rule that ethereal creatures cannot affect targets
      on the Material Plane).</p>
