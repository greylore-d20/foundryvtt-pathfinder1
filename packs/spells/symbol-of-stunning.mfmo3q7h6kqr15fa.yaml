      <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that all
      creatures within 60 feet of a <i>symbol of stunning</i> instead become
      stunned for 1d6 rounds.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol
      of stunning</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the
      Perception skill to find a <i>symbol of stunning</i> and Disable Device to
      thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for <i>symbol of
      stunning</i>.</p>
