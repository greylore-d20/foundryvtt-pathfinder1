      <p><i>Marks of Forbiddance</i> magically brand two creatures, preventing
      them from committing violence against one another. When you cast this
      spell choose one enemy and one ally within range. Both targets become
      branded with the sigil of forbiddance. Until the end of the spell's
      duration, in order for the two targets to attack one another, even with a
      targeted spell, each attacker must attempt a Will save. If the save
      succeeds, that target can attack the other normally.</p><p>If the save
      fails, the target can't follow through with the attack and the action is
      lost. This spell does not prevent the targets from attacking each other
      with area of effect spells or abilities.</p>
