    value: >-
      <p>Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a
      single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful
      melee touch attack.</p><p>A paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that
      causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to
      become sickened (Fortitude negates). A <i>neutralize poison</i> spell
      removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to
      poison are unaffected by the stench. This is a poison effect.</p>
