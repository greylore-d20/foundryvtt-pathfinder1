    value: >-
      <p>This bauble, bit of clothing, or relic has some minor historical
      significance. Though not especially valuable, itâ€™s useful to an occultist,
      who can use it as an implement. Any such item is nonmagical, even if it
      appears to be a rod or wand. Implements that already have a mundane
      version with a price higher than 10 gp (such as armor, shields, weapons,
      and harrow decks) use their normal item entries instead of this
      catchall.</p>
