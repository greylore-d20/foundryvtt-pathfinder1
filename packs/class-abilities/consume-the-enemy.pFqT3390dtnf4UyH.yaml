  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a full-round action that is considered an evil act and provokes
      attacks of opportunity, you can bite a helpless living or freshly killed
      creature, dealing 1d3 points of damage. By consuming the creatureâ€™s flesh,
      you gain a +1 profane bonus on saving throw DCs for all spells, spell-like
      abilities, and supernatural abilities you use against creatures of the
      same type (and subtype, if humanoid or outsider) as the cannibalized
      creature. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 your
      cleric level or until you use this ability against a different creature.
      At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, this bonus increases by 1 (+5
      maximum). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Touch of Evil power of the Evil Domain.</p>
