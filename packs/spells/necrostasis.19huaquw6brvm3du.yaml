      <p>You drain necromantic energy from an undead creature, inducing a
      sluggish stupor. The target becomes staggered. For the duration of the
      spell, dark wisps of energy seep out of the target creature. If the target
      already has the staggered condition (as a zombie does), it becomes dazed
      for 1 round instead.</p>
