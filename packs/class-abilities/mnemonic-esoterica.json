Once per day when you prepare your spells, you can add one spell from this classâ€™s spell list to your spells known and class spell list for 24 hours. This spell must be 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast, and you cast it as if it were psychic magic. You can decide to change the spellcasting class from which you draw this spell each time you gain a new level.</p>"
