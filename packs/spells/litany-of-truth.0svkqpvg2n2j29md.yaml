    value: >-
      <p>With a tirade against deceit, you strip the target of any illusions
      cloaking it. Any illusion spells or effects affecting the target are
      suppressed for the spell's duration. In addition, the target can't benefit
      from concealment.  While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the
      target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.</p>
