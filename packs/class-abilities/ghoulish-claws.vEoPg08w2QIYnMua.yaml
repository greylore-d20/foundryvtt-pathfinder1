  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you can grow claws as a <em>free action</em>.
      These claws are treated as <em>natural weapons</em>, allowing you to make
      two claw attacks as a full attack using your full <em>base attack
      bonus</em>. Each of these attacks deals 1d4 points of damage + your
      <em>Strength</em> modifier (1d3 if you are Small). At 5th level, creatures
      damaged with your claw attack are <em>paralyzed</em> for 1 round, as the
      <em>ghoul</em> ability (<em>Fort</em> negates). At 7th level, the duration
      of the <em>paralysis</em> increases to 1d4+1 rounds, and the claws are
      considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming <em>DR</em>. You
      can use your claws for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Charisma</em> modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. If
      you’re a <em>ghoul</em> with this <em>bloodline</em>, instead of gaining
      this ability, your levels in <em>sorcerer</em> stack with your racial
      <em>Hit Dice</em> when determining the DC of your <em>paralysis</em> and
      <em>disease</em> special abilities.</p>
