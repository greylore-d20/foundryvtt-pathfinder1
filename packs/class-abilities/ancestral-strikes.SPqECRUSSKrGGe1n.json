For 1 round, your melee attacks deal 1d6 additional points of good-aligned damage if you are good, or they deal 1d6 additional points of evil-aligned damage if you are evil. If you are neutral, you must choose which type of damage this ability deals when you choose this bloodline, and the decision cannot be changed later.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, you can use this ability up to five times per day.</p>\n<p>At 20th level, all your melee attacks deal this additional damage, and you don’t need to activate this ability.</p>"
