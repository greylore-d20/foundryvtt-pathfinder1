    value: >-
      <p>When an investigator deals damage with studied strike, the opponent
      must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently deafened. A
      successful Fortitude saving throw reduces the duration of this effect to 1
      round. The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the investigatorâ€™s level
      + his Intelligence modifier. This talent has no effect on deaf creatures.
      Deafness can be cured by heal, regeneration, remove blindness, or similar
      effects.</p>

      <p>An investigator must be at least 15th level to select this talent.</p>
