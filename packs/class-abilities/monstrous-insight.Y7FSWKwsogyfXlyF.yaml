    value: >-
      <p>The shaman can identify creatures and gain insight into their strengths
      and weaknesses. As a standard action, the shaman can attempt a Knowledge
      skill check to identify a creature and its abilities (using the
      appropriate skill for the monsterâ€™s type) with an insight bonus equal to
      her shaman level. Whether or not the check is successful, she also gains a
      +2 insight bonus for 1 minute on attack rolls made against that creature
      and a +2 insight bonus to her AC against attacks made by that creature.
      These bonuses last for 1 minute.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      her Charisma modifier.</p>
