      <p>This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and
      harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2)
      can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind,
      and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of HD of
      animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level.</p><p>The affected
      creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not
      helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the
      spell on the threatened creatures.</p>
