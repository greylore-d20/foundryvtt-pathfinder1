  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target gains a 5-foot-radius aura that causes the blood of creatures
    in that area to ignite upon contact with air. Any creature (including the
    spell's target) within the aura that takes at least 5 points of piercing,
    slashing, or bleed damage from a single attack automatically creates a spray
    of burning blood. The spray strikes a creature in a randomly determined
    square adjacent to the injured creature. The spray deals 1d6 points of fire
    damage to any creature in that square, and 1 point of splash damage to all
    creatures within 5 feet of the spray's target, including the target of this
    spell. A creature can only create one spray of burning blood per round.
    Creatures that do not have blood (including oozes and most constructs and
    undead) do not create blood sprays when attacked.</p>
