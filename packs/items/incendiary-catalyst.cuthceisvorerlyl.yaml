      <p>Incendiary catalyst can be thrown at a creature as a ranged <em>touch
      attack</em> with a range increment of 10 feet. On a hit, the target is
      doused with accelerants that give the target <em>vulnerability</em> to
      fire for 1 round. Incendiary catalyst does not affect creatures that are
      already vulnerable to fire, and the target's fire <em>immunity</em> and
      resistances apply as normal. Crafting this item requires a successful DC
      20 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check.</p>
