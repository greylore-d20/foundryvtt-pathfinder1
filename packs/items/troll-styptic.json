This powder is stored in small packets, and when applied directly to wounds grants a living creature <em>fast healing</em> 2 for 2d4 rounds, as well as closing any open wounds the subject has or receives while the styptic is active, preventing ongoing damage from bleeding. This is a painful cure and requires the target to make a DC 15 <em>Fortitude</em> save to avoid being <em>sickened</em> for the duration of the <em>fast healing</em>.</p>\n<p><b>Create</b>: <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC 25</p>"
