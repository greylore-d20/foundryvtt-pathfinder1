      <p>Consecrated to one of Golarion’s many deities, this intricately etched
      case contains numerous candles, stands, scented herbs, dishes, silks,
      small cups, containers, and similar ceremonial tools all bearing colors
      and iconography sacred to the associated deity. The sturdy container
      features a padded interior with numerous straps and compartments so that
      the items within aren’t damaged in transport. The altar’s surface
      prominently features a deity’s holy symbol, and it’s sturdy enough that it
      can support up to 300 pounds of weight, enough to serve as a makeshift
      pulpit.</p><p>Among the items found within the altar are the tools and
      materials necessary to perform not just ceremonies, but also jobs and
      professions the related deity deems sacred, as well as holy texts written
      to inspire greatness in the deity’s followers. The user can expend some of
      the materials within the altar to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the next
      Craft check of the specified type (see below).</p><p>In addition, after
      spending 1 hour praying and reading the holy scriptures within the altar,
      the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on a single skill check. Which
      deity this altar is dedicated to determines the skill to which this bonus
      applies (see below). The user must attempt this skill check within an hour
      of praying and reading the altar’s scriptures or lose the bonus—the
      mantras and inspiration provided by the texts having drifted from her
      mind. This hour of prayer and scripture reading can be integrated with the
      time a cleric uses to prepare her spells. Regardless, using the masterwork
      portable altar in this manner expends the altar’s materials in the same
      way that using the normal altar to bolster a Craft check does. A
      masterwork portable altar can be used multiple times, but after 20 uses,
      it must be restocked with 50 gp worth of sanctified materials—preferably
      purchased from a temple of the associated deity. The altar grants no
      bonuses on skill checks if used while its materials are depleted, though
      it can still be employed as a normal
