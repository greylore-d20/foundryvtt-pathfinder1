  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, the bard becomes a master of lore and can take 10 on any
      <em>Knowledge</em> skill check that he has ranks in. A bard can choose not
      to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, once per day, the
      bard can take 20 on any <em>Knowledge</em> skill check as a <em>standard
      action</em>. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every
      six levels he possesses beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at
      17th level.</p>
