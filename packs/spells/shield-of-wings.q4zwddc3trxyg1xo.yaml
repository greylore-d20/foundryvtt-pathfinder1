  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain five burning wings that grant a fly speed equal to the number
      of wings x 10 (average maneuverability) for an initial fly speed of 50
      feet. The first time in a round where you would take fire damage, a wing
      vanishes (reducing the fly speed granted) and you gain fire resistance 30
      for the remainder of the round. When you are down to one wing (and a fly
      speed of 10 feet), your maneuverability drops to poor. When you lose your
      final wing, you become immune to fire damage for 1 additional minute,
      after which the effects of this spell end.</p>
