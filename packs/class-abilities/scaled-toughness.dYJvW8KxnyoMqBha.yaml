    value: >-
      <p>You can manifest the scaly toughness of dragonkind. Once per day as a
      swift action, you can harden your skin, giving it a scaly appearance and
      granting you DR 10/magic. During this time, you are also immune to
      paralysis and sleep effects. This effect lasts for a number of rounds
      equal to your oracle level.</p><p>At 13th level, you can use this ability
      twice per day.</p><p>You must be at least 7th level to select this
      revelation.</p>
