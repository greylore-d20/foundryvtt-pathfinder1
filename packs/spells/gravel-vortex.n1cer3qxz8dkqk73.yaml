    value: >-
      <p>You create a hail of tiny pieces of rock and dust that batter and
      scrape against all things in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage. This damage is dealt only once, on the round the spell is cast.
      For the remaining duration of the spell, fine dust rains down in the area.
      Creatures other than stone giants inside this area take a -4 penalty on
      Perception skill checks, and the entire area is treated as difficult
      terrain. At the end of the spell's duration, the gravel and dust
      disappear, leaving no trace of their presence.</p>
