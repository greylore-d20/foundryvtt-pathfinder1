Both cannons and fiend's mouth cannons can fire this kind of ammunition.</p>\n<p>When such a siege engine fires this ammunition, it hits every creature and object within a <b>30-foot-cone burst</b>. The siege engine makes attack rolls against each creature and unattended object in the burst.</p>\n<h3>Mishap</h3>\n<p>It must miss every creature or target to misfire, and a misfire generates the normal effect. It deals its normal damage on a hit, but does not ignore the hardness of objects.</p>"
