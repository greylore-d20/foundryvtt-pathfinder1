      <p>You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire.</p><p>This
      spell functions like <i>greater magic weapon</i>, except that it subtly
      alters the physical properties of a weapon, enabling it to bypass damage
      reduction of one the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, piercing,
      silver, or slashing. The affected weapon still inflicts damage of its
      normal type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged. This spell can
      be cast on a natural weapon or unarmed strike.</p>
