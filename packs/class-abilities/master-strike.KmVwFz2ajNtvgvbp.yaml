  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when
      dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack
      damage, she can choose one of the following three effects:</p>

      <p>The target can be…</p>

      <ul>

      <li>put to sleep for 1d4 hours</li>

      <li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.24p2Koq4FFCLDKnj]{paralyzed}</em>
      for 2d6 rounds, or</li>

      <li>slain</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Regardless of the effect chosen, the target receives a
      <em>Fortitude</em> save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this
      save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue’s level + the rogue’s
      <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a
      master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is made, that
      creature is immune to that rogue’s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures
      that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this
      ability.</p>
