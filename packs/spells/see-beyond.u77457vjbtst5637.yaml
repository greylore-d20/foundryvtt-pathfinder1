      <p>You attune your mind and your sight to the hidden world of spirits. You
      gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Perception checks; this circumstance bonus
      increases to a +10 circumstance bonus  on Perception checks to find
      invisible creatures or objects, incorporeal creatures or objects, or
      things that exist only on the Ethereal Plane. Additionally, at any time
      during the spell's duration, you can push your ethereal vision even
      further as a swift action. When you do, you can see through solid objects
      (as if using a <i>ring of x-ray</i> vision) for 5 rounds. After this time,
      the spell ends.</p>
