      <p>You can see through mist and fog (including fog cloud and similar
      magic). In areas of moderate or stronger wind, you can see and hear as if
      you were standing at both your own position and a position a number of
      feet in the wind’s direction equal to the wind’s speed in miles per hour,
      potentially allowing you to see around corners and other obstacles.</p>
