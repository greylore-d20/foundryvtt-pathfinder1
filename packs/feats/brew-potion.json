      "value": "<i>You can create magic potions.</i>\n<p>\n<p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>\n<p>Caster level 3rd.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Benefits</b></p>\n<p><p>You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures or objects. Brewing a potion takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less, otherwise brewing a potion takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. To brew a potion, you must use up raw materials costing one half this base price. See the magic item creation rules in Magic Items for more information.</p><p>When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.</p></p>"
