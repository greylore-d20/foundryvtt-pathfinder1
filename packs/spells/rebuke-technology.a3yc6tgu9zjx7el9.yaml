      <p>You shroud the targeted technological object or creature (such as a
      robot or a nanotech swarm) with magical energy.</p><p>If the targeted
      creature fails to resist the spell, it is rendered inert and unusable (or
      unconscious in the case of creatures) for the spell's duration. A creature

      end of its turn after the first full round it is affected by this
