    value: >-
      <p>This spell imbues a quill with animate energy and rapidly transcribes
      words from one page to another. The quill copies a written work at the
      rate of one normal-sized page per minute.</p><p>The Linguistics skill can
      be used to make a convincing copy, but otherwise the reproduction is
      written in the hand of the caster.</p><p>You must concentrate upon the
      material being duplicated for the spell's duration and provide new blank
      pages as required.</p><p>The <i>scrivener's chant</i> requires blank paper
      and a quill or other writing materials, in addition to the material
      components.</p><p>This spell cannot duplicate magical writing (including
      spells and magical scrolls), though it can duplicate non-magical writing
      from a magical source.</p>
