  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you can summon a ghostly army from a fallen civilization
      once per day. This functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.0lrux8tmaml5fkw6]{Spiritual Ally} with a caster
      level equal to your level, except that it summons a number of allies equal
      to your Constitution modifier, and the allies use your Strength modifier
      for attack rolls. You can direct all of these allies with a single swift
      action. Each ally can attack a different target or the same target, as you
      direct. The allies remain until the spellâ€™s duration ends or your
      bloodrage ends, whichever comes first.</p>
