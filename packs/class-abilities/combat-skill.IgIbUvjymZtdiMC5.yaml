  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante gains any one combat feat as a bonus feat. He must meet
      the prerequisites for this feat, but he is treated as though he had a
      number of fighter levels equal to half his vigilante level for the purpose
      of qualifying for this feat.</p>

      <p>Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent, but he can select
      this talent more than once; each time he must select a different feat.</p>
