  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian visibly burns with an inner flame that consumes all
      impurities affecting her. Each round that the barbarian rages reduces the
      duration of negative spells and effects inflicted upon her as if 2 rounds
      had passed; this has no effect on the duration of such effects against
      other creatures. Once per day, the barbarian can expend 5 rounds of rage
      to attempt a new saving throw against each nonpermanent effect currently
      affecting her. Each successful saving throw ends the related effect, and
      she can choose not to make a save against an effect.</p>
