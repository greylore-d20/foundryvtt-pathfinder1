    "shortDescription": "<p>You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as <i>greater teleport,</i> any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.</p><p>The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.</p><p><i>Teleportation circle</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>teleportation circle</i> that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.</p><p>Magic traps such as <i>teleportation circle</i> are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use the Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of <i>teleportation circle</i>.</p>",
