      <p>You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you
      with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of fire
      damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures with reach
      weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield
      provides illumination as if it were a <i>continual flame</i> spell. You
      can only have one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not
      stack with similar damaging aura spells such as <i>fire shield</i>.</p>
