  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You assume the form of a Small or Medium creature of the fey type. Your
      base speed changes to match the new form's base speed, with a maximum
      speed of 60 feet (even if the chosen fey form has a base speed in excess
      of that speed). If the form you assume has any of the following abilities,
      you gain those abilities: climb speed 30 feet, fly speed 30 feet (average
      maneuverability), swim speed 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light
      vision, scent, and boot stomp. If the form you assume has the aquatic
      subtype, you can breathe air and water. If the creature has any
      weaknesses, you gain those weaknesses. If a listed ability depends on an
      item (as is the case with boot stomp), this spell transforms the nearest
      counterpart among your worn gear into that item.</p><p>You can more easily
      cast spells that the creature has as spell-like abilities, although you
      must still cast them as normal for your class. When you cast a spell that
      the creature has as a spell-like ability, it requires no verbal or somatic
      components and can't be countered.</p><p>Small Fey: If you assume this
      form, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Dexterity and Constitution
      scores.</p><p>Medium Fey: If you assume this form, you gain a +2 size
      bonus to your Strength and Constitution scores.</p>
