      <p>You fling a ray of deadly cosmic energy at the target creature. If you
      succeed at a ranged touch attack with the ray, the target takes 1d6 points
      of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and must make a Fortitude save.
      On a failed save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round per caster level
      and emits toxic cosmic energy for as long as it is sickened; any creature
      that comes within 5 feet of the affected target must succeed at a
      Fortitude save (DC = spell's DC) or become sickened for 1 round per 2
      caster levels.</p>
