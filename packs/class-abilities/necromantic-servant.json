      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to raise a single human skeleton (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;250) or human zombie (Bestiary&nbsp;288) from the ground to serve you for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess or until it is destroyed, whichever comes first. This servant has a number of hit points equal to 1/2 your maximum hit point total (not adjusted for temporary hit points or other temporary increases). It also uses your base attack bonus and gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 your occultist level.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, whenever the necromantic servant would be destroyed, if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) of the servant, you can expend 1 point of mental focus as an immediate action to cause the servant to return to full hit points.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can choose to give the servant the bloody or burning simple template (if it’s a skeleton) or the fast simple template (if it’s a zombie).</p>\n<p>At 13th level, when you take an immediate action to restore your servant, it splits into two servants. You can have a maximum number of servants in existence equal to 1/2 your occultist level.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, the servant gains a teamwork feat of your choice.</p>"
