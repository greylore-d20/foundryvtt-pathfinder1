  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>These slightly curved swords measure just over 3 feet in
      length.</em></p>

      <p>An <em>dueling sword</em> can be used as a martial weapon (in which
      case it functions as a
      @Compendium[pf1.weapons-and-ammo.zWRlna42PMJVX6un]{longsword}), but if you
      have the feat @Compendium[pf1.feats.BJBC4lbo7xGWPsKJ]{Exotic Weapon
      Proficiency (dueling sword)}, you can use the
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.vWiTqHC4Y3Xn1Pme]{Weapon Finesse} feat to apply your
      <em>Dexterity</em> modifier instead of your <em>Strength</em> modifier to
      <em>attack rolls</em> with a <em>dueling sword</em> sized for you, even
      though it isn't a light weapon. You can also wield a <em>dueling
      sword</em> in two hands to apply 1-1/2 times your <em>Strength</em> bonus
      to damage rolls.</p>
