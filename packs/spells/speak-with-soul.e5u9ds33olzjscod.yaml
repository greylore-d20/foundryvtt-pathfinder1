      <p>You commune with the soul of a dead creature. To cast this spell, you
      must be at the soul's place of death or be in the soul's presence, whether
      it is contained in a receptacle, powers an intelligent magic item, or
      other possibilities. The soul can attempt a Will save to resist the spell
      as if it were alive.  A soul contacted this way can speak normally in any
      language it knows. Unlike <i>speak with dead</i> and similar spells, you
      are not limited to asking questions and can engage in normal conversation
      with the soul (and vice versa). The soul isn't an undead creature and
      isn't compelled to speak or be truthful. Generally, the soul only knows
      what it knew in life, although souls that persisted with awareness of
      their surroundings after death may have more to offer.</p>
