  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one <em>combat style</em> to
      pursue.</p>

      <p>The ranger’s expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd,
      6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected
      combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>

      <p>The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style feats apply only when he
      wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat
      style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat
      style, it cannot be changed.</p>
