    value: >-
      <p>You attune the target's internal store of supernatural energy to the
      cosmos, replenishing its ki pool. If you are the target, you regain 2 ki
      points. If another creature is the target, it regains 1 ki point. This
      does not allow the target to exceed its ki pool's maximum. This spell has
      no effect if the target does not have a ki pool.</p>
