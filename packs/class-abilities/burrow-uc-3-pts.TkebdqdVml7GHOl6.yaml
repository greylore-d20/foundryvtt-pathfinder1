      <p>The eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through
      the earth. The eidolon gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2 its base speed.
      It can use this speed to move through clay, dirt, earth, and sand. It does
      not leave a hole behind, nor is its passage marked on the surface.</p>
