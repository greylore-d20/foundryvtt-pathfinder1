      "value": "<p><strong>Element </strong>aether; <strong>Type </strong>utility (Sp); <strong>Level </strong>5; <strong>Burn </strong>0</p>\n<p>You use strands of aether to animate an object. You can animate a Medium or smaller object as an animated object (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14) with no Construction Point abilities (except for stone or metal [common], if the object is constructed of one of those materials). Each round on your turn, you must take a move action to guide the object, or it reverts to its inanimate state.</p>\n<p>By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of your own sentience into the aether puppet, allowing the effect to persist for 1 round per kineticist level without requiring additional actions.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, you can animate a Large or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Medium animated object plus the additional attack ability.</p>\n<p>At 14th level, you can animate a Huge or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Large animated object.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, you can animate a Gargantuan or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Huge animated object, as well as the metal (mithral) ability if the object is made of mithral.</p>\n<p>At 18th level, you can animate a Colossal or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Gargantuan animated object, plus the metal (adamantine) ability if the object is made of adamantine.</p>"
