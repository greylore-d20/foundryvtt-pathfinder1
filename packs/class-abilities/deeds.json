      "value": "<p>Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Gunslinger Deeds:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Deadeye (Ex):</em> At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm’s first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the –2 penalty on&nbsp;<em>attack rolls</em>&nbsp;for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.</p>\n<p><em>Gunslinger’s Dodge (Ex):</em> At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an <em>immediate action</em>; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes&nbsp;<em>attacks of opportunity</em>. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop&nbsp;<em>prone</em> to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.</p>\n<p><em>Quick Clear (Ex):</em> At 1st level, as a&nbsp;<em>standard action</em>, the gunslinger can remove the&nbsp;<em>broken</em>&nbsp;condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a&nbsp;<em>standard action</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Gunslinger Initiative (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<em>initiative</em>&nbsp;checks. Furthermore, if she has the&nbsp;<em>Quick Draw</em>&nbsp;feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the&nbsp;<em>initiative</em>&nbsp;check.</p>\n<p><em>Pistol-Whip (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a&nbsp;<em>standard action</em>. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the&nbsp;<em>enhancement bonus</em>&nbsp;of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger’s size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/×2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a&nbsp;<em>combat maneuver</em>&nbsp;check to knock the target&nbsp;<em>prone</em>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<em>free action</em>. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.</p>\n<p><em>Utility Shot (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blast Lock:</em> The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<em>attack roll</em>&nbsp;against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC.&nbsp;<em>Arcane lock</em>&nbsp;grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the&nbsp;<em>Disable Device</em>&nbsp;skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or&nbsp;<em>Disable Device</em>&nbsp;or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though&nbsp;<em>knock</em>&nbsp;can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an&nbsp;<em>arcane lock</em>&nbsp;can still bypass the wards of that spell.</li>\n<li><em>Scoot Unattended Object: </em>The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<em>attack roll</em>&nbsp;against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot’s origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.</li>\n<li><em>Stop Bleeding: </em>The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single&nbsp;<em>bleed</em>&nbsp;condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an&nbsp;<em>attack roll</em>&nbsp;when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Dead Shot (Ex):</em> At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<em>full-round action</em>, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many&nbsp;<em>attack rolls</em>&nbsp;as she can, based on her&nbsp;<em>base attack bonus</em>. She makes the&nbsp;<em>attack rolls</em>&nbsp;in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the&nbsp;<em>attack rolls</em>&nbsp;hit the target, the gunslinger’s single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful&nbsp;<em>attack roll</em>&nbsp;beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as&nbsp;<em>flaming</em>) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest&nbsp;<em>base attack bonus</em>&nbsp;–5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the&nbsp;<em>attack rolls</em>&nbsp;are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.</p>\n<p><em>Startling Shot (Ex): </em>At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a&nbsp;<em>standard action</em>&nbsp;to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes&nbsp;<em>flat-footed</em>&nbsp;until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p><em>Targeting (Ex):</em> At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<em>full-round action</em>, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<em>sneak attacks</em>&nbsp;are immune to these effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Arms:</em> On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger’s choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.</li>\n<li><em>Head:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also&nbsp;<em>confused</em>&nbsp;for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><em>Legs:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked&nbsp;<em>prone</em>. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to&nbsp;<em>trip</em>&nbsp;attacks are immune to this effect.</li>\n<li><em>Torso:</em> Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19–20.</li>\n<li><em>Wings:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20&nbsp;<em>Fly</em>&nbsp;check or fall 20 ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Bleeding Wound (Ex):</em> At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a&nbsp;<em>free action</em>&nbsp;to have that attack deal extra&nbsp;<em>bleed</em>&nbsp;damage. The amount of&nbsp;<em>bleed</em>&nbsp;damage is equal to the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<em>Dexterity</em>&nbsp;modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of&nbsp;<em>Strength</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dexterity</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Constitution</em>&nbsp;<em>bleed</em>&nbsp;damage (gunslinger’s choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<em>sneak attacks</em>&nbsp;are also immune to these types of&nbsp;<em>bleed</em>&nbsp;damage.</p>\n<p><em>Expert Loading (Ex): </em>At 11th level, whenever the gunslinger rolls a misfire with a gun that has the&nbsp;<em>broken</em>&nbsp;condition, she can spend 1 grit point to keep the gun from exploding, though it retains the&nbsp;<em>broken</em>&nbsp;condition.</p>\n<p><em>Lightning Reload (Ex): </em>At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a&nbsp;<em>swift action</em>&nbsp;once per round. If she has the&nbsp;<em>Rapid Reload</em>&nbsp;feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a&nbsp;<em>free action</em>&nbsp;each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke&nbsp;<em>attacks of opportunity</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Evasive (Ex): </em>At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the&nbsp;<em>evasion</em>,&nbsp;<em>uncanny dodge</em>, and&nbsp;<em>improved uncanny dodge</em>&nbsp;<em>rogue</em>&nbsp;class features. She uses her gunslinger level as her&nbsp;<em>rogue</em>&nbsp;level for&nbsp;<em>improved uncanny dodge</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Menacing Shot (Ex):</em> At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst as if they were subject to the&nbsp;<em>fear</em>&nbsp;spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<em>Wisdom</em>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p><em>Slinger’s Luck (Ex):</em> At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed’s cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.</p>\n<p><em>Cheat Death (Ex): </em>At 19th level, whenever the gunslinger is reduced to 0 or fewer&nbsp;<em>hit points</em>, she can spend all of her remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.</p>\n<p><em>Death’s Shot (Ex):</em> At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a&nbsp;<em>critical hit</em>, she can spend 1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a&nbsp;<em>Fortitude</em>&nbsp;saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<em>Dexterity</em>&nbsp;modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a&nbsp;<em>critical hit</em>&nbsp;or making a killing blow.</p>\n<p><em>Stunning Shot (Ex):</em> At 19th level, when a gunslinger hits a creature, she can spend 2 grit points to&nbsp;<em>stun</em>&nbsp;the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a&nbsp;<em>Fortitude</em>&nbsp;saving throw (the DC = 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger’s level + the gunslinger’s&nbsp;<em>Wisdom</em>&nbsp;modifier). If the creature fails, it is&nbsp;<em>stunned</em>&nbsp;for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect.</p>"
