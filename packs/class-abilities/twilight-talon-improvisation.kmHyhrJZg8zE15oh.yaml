  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the investigator deals studied strike damage with an
      improvised weapon, she can perform a dirty trick combat maneuver targeting
      that foe as a free action. This combat maneuver provokes attacks of
      opportunity as normal unless the investigator has a feat or other ability
      to prevent it.</p>
