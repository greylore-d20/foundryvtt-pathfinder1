    value: >-
      <p>You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid
      footing and halving the target's speed. The target also takes a -4 penalty
      to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted
      creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself
      increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls,
      the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full-round action
      spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.  This spell
      fails if cast on a flying creature.</p>
