      "value": "<p>A rogue with this talent takes only a –2 penalty on Ride checks when riding a mount bareback instead of the normal –5 penalty. When using the Ride skill to make a mount leap, a rogue with this talent can use her Ride modifier or her mount’s jump modifier, whichever is higher, instead of using the lower of the two. A rogue with this talent gains a +5 competence bonus when using the Ride skill to soften a fall from her mount or to perform a fast mount or dismount. Finally, a rogue with this talent can attempt a DC 15 Ride check to recover from a position of cover as a free action instead of as a move action. Failing this check results in the recovery requiring a move action as normal. A rogue must be trained in Ride to select this talent.</p>"
