  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This ward grants you extra maneuverability when you avoid attacks
      against larger foes. While affected by this spell, when you are attacked
      and missed by a creature that is at least one size category larger than
      you, you can, as an immediate action, move up to 5 feet away from the
      attacking creature. You can increase this movement by 5 feet for every 5
      caster levels. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
