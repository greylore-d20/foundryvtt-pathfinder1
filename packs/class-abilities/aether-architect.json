      "value": "<p><strong>Element&nbsp;</strong>aether;&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>utility (Su);&nbsp;<strong>Level&nbsp;</strong>9;&nbsp;<strong>Burn&nbsp;</strong>0</p>\n<p>You can spin a small building, bridge, or other edifice out of aether, and even use aether to tether a building to a flat surface other than the ground. By concentrating for 10 minutes, you can create an edifice out of scintillating aether (same hardness and hit points as a&nbsp;wall of force) as long as the edifice is no larger than one 10-foot cube per kineticist level. Unless the creation is extremely simplistic, you must succeed at a Craft or Knowledge (engineering) check to add embellishments.</p>\n<p>This ability can also create a series of tethers to securely attach a normal building to a vertical surface or even a cavern ceiling. Aether architect lasts as long as you concentrate, and you can accept 1 point of burn to make the effect last until destroyed; by accepting this burn, you can use this ability any number of times in a row to create a larger edifice.</p>"
