    "shortDescription": "<p>A ring of fire surrounds the area affected by the spell. The flames radiate heat, but not enough to damage adjacent creatures. The flames deal [[/d 2d6]] points of fire damage to any creatures that pass through them (or [[/d 4d6]] points of damage to undead creatures). If you manifest a portion of the ring in a square that contains a creature, that creature takes damage as if it passed through the ring.</p><p>The ring of flames attempts to dispel all ongoing spell effects with the evil descriptor within it, targeting each spell effect once per round as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{dispel magic}. Any attempt to cast a spell with the evil descriptor inside the ring of flames is targeted by a <em>dispel magic</em> affect that attempts to counterspell the <em>evil</em> spell.</p>"
