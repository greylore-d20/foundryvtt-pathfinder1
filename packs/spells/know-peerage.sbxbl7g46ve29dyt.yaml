  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You impart your knowledge of nobility and peerage to the target, allowing
    her to recognize members of noble households, differentiate one set of
    heraldry from another, and otherwise identify who's who at a royal gala or
    other noteworthy social event. The target is able to identify noble
    individuals, noble family names, and noble crests, signets, heraldry, and
    other symbols. The target treats her number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility)
    as though it were equal to your number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility), to
    a maximum of 5 ranks and a minimum of 0. If the target's number of ranks is
    greater than yours, she uses her own number of ranks instead. In addition,
    if the target's new total skill bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks is at
    least +0, she automatically succeeds on all Knowledge (nobility) checks with
    a DC of 10 or lower.</p>
