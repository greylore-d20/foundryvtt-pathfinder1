  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The joints of a creature affected by this spell stiffen and swell,
      making movement painful and slow. The target takes 1d6 points of nonlethal
      damage per caster level. Additionally, the target takes a -4 penalty to
      Dexterity and its movement speed decreases by 10 feet; these additional
      effects last for 1 minute per caster level, though another creature can
      spend 1 minute and attempt a DC 25 Heal check to end them early. A
      successful save halves the nonlethal damage and negates the penalty to
      Dexterity and movement.</p>
