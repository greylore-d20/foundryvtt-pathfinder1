It takes a standard action to take on the form of ice, and you can end the transmutation with a free action on your turn. When you take on the form of ice, you are immune to cold and have DR 5/â€”, but you take twice the normal amount of damage from fire. You can take on the form of ice for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. The rounds need not be consecutive.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Cold Resistance power of the Water Domain.</p>"
