      <p>You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the ability to
      cast them, to another creature. Only a creature with an Intelligence score
      of at least 5 and a Wisdom score of at least 9 can receive this boon. Only
      cleric spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration
      (healing) can be transferred. The number and level of spells that the
      subject can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of
      <i>imbue with spell ability</i> can't exceed this
      limit.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>HD of recipient</th><th>Spells

      variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and the like) function
      according to your level, not the level of the recipient.<p></p><p>Once you
      cast <i>imbue with spell ability</i>, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level
      spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued spells or is
      slain, or until you dismiss the <i>imbue with spell ability</i> spell. In
      the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for
      the use to which the spell is put. If the number of 4th-level spells you
      can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of
      active <i>imbue with spell ability</i> spells, the more recently cast
      imbued spells are dispelled.</p><p>To cast a spell with a verbal
      component, the subject must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a
      somatic component, it must be able to move freely. To cast a spell with a
      material component or focus, it must have the materials or focus.</p>
