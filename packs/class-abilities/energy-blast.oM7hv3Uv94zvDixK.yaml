    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can
      expend 2 points of mental focus to unleash a blast of energy. This blast
      has a range of 100 feet, and deals 5d6 points of energy damage, plus an
      additional 1d6 points for every 2 occultist levels you possess beyond 5th
      (6d6 at 7th, 7d6 at 9th, and so on, to a maximum of 12d6 at 19th level).
      The blast deals damage to each creature in a 20-foot-radius burst, but
      each affected creature can attempt a Reflex save to halve the damage. When
      you unleash an energy blast, you must decide what type of damage it deals
      (acid, cold, electricity, or fire).</p>

      <p>You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
