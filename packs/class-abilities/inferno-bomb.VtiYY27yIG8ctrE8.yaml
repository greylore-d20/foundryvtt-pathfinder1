  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicate the
      effects of @Compendium[pf1.spells.iq0as5470o8q9y39]{Incendiary Cloud}
      instead of @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud}, filling an
      area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the smoke
      bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
