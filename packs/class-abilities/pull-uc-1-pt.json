      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements: </strong>Reach of 10 feet or more.</p>\n<p>The eidolon gains the ability to pull creatures closer with a successful attack. Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, it pulls the target of the attack 5 feet closer to it. This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures pulled in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural attack.&nbsp;</p>"
