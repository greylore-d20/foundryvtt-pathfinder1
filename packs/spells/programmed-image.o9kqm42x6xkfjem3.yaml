      <p>This spell functions like <i>silent image,</i> except that this spell's
      figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes
      visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible
      speech.</p><p>You set the triggering condition (which may be a special
      word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be
      as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an
      audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be
      based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as
      alignment. See <i>magic mouth</i> for more details about such
      triggers.</p>
