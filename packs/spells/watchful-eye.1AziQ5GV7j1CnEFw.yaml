      <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> In order to prepare this spell, the caster must
      spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches <b>Folgrit</b>.
      Further details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of
      Golarion.</em></p><p>This spell emulates Folgritâ€™s motherly protection. It
      functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.menqakfoa1ftvi3f]{Shield Other},
      except as noted above, and you must maintain line of effect to the
      target.</p>
