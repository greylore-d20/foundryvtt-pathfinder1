      <p>A monk with this ability can spend 2 ki points as an immediate action
      to give another ally within 30 feet just the right word of advice to
      prevent disaster. If the ally can hear the monk, she can reroll a single
      attack roll or saving throw. The ally must take the second result, even if
      it is worse.</p>
