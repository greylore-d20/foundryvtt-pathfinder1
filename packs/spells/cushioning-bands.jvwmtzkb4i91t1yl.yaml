      <p>Invisible bands of force encircle vital areas of the target. The bands
      resist crushing forces and impacts without interfering with movement. The
      target gains DR 2/piercing or slashing and takes half damage from
      constriction, falling, and being buried, as well as from similar crushing
      effects such as <i>crushing hand</i>. Grapple checks for attacks other
      than constricting (such as pinning or swallowing whole) are not affected.
      Once the spell has blocked 12 points of damage per caster level (to a
      maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged. The bands have no
      effect on incorporeal attacks unless they deal damage from constriction or
      crushing, or unless the attacks would be subject to damage reduction.</p>
