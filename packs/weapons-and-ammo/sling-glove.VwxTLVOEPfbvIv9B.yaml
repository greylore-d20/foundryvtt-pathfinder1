  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This curved, scooped-shaped, 2-foot-long wicker basket attaches to your
      wrist, allowing you to throw fist-sized stones at great speed merely by
      whipping your arm forward. Loading a sling glove is a free action that
      does not provoke an attack of opportunity so long as you have a free hand.
      You take -4 penalty when throwing a stone at an adjacent target and cannot
      use the weapon to attack creatures in your space.</p>
