    value: >-
      <p>You inflict a curse of the roiling sea upon the target, making it
      permanently sickened. Anytime the target is on or in the water more than a
      mile from shore, it also becomes staggered with seasickness. This curse
      cannot be dispelled, though <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break
      enchantment</i> can negate it.</p>
