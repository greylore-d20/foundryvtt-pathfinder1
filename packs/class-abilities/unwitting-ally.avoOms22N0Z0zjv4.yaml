  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can spend a swift action to attempt to
      make an opponent act like an ally for purposes of providing a flank until
      the beginning of the character's next turn. The opponent must be able to
      hear and see the character, and the character must succeed at a Bluff
      check opposed by the opponentâ€™s Sense Motive. If the check succeeds, the
      opponent acts as an ally for the purpose of providing a flank. Whether or
      not the check succeeds, the character cannot use this trick again on the
      same opponent for the next 24 hours. If the character fails the check by 5
      or more, she cannot use the unwitting ally ability on any opponent within
      line of sight of the failed attempt for 24 hours.</p>
