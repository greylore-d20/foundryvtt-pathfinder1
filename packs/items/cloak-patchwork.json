The patches represent where the traveler has been, and often the performer uses them to recall specific stories from his repertoire. When a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bard</a> retires or dies, he often bequeaths his cloak to a young entertainer he mentored or admired.</p> \n"
