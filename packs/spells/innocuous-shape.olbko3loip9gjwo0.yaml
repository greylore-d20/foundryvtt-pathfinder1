      <p>This spell transforms a creature into a Medium or smaller animal or
      humanoid of no more than 1 Hit Die. If you use this spell to cause the
      target to take on the form of an animal, the spell functions as <i>beast
      shape II</i>. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell can function as
      <i>alter self</i>, <i>youthful</i> appearanceUM, or both, such that you
      can transform a creature into a generic, <i>youthful</i> humanoid of any
      type.  Any creature that interacts with the target of this spell must
      succeed at a Will saving throw (using the DC of the spell) or view the
      target in the most innocuous possible light. On a failed saving throw, the
      creature views all of the target's actions as inoffensive and no cause for
      concern unless the target becomes an obvious threat. The creature can
      otherwise act normally, and feels no compunction to obey or ignore the
      target; it simply assumes none of the target's actions are dangerous or
      malicious unless shown evidence that proves otherwise.</p>
