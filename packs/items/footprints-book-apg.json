      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Footprints Book (APG)</b> This 50-page tome contains accurate drawings of various common <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoid</a>, and monster tracks, as well as notes on stride length, tread depth, and similarly useful information. The book gives you a +2 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a> to identify a creature by its tracks, though the use of shoes makes identifying many <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoids</a> difficult or impossible. Though the book can't help you identify unique individuals, it can help you tell an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre\">ogre</a> footprint from a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/troll\">troll</a> footprint, or an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf\">elf's</a> track from an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orcs/orc\">orc's</a>. Books sold in different areas may have different footprints, depending on what creatures are common to that location. <b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1115</em></p>\r\n"
