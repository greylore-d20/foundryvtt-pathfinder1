  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.2p6fzj5t03oivndd]{command}, except that up to one
    creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1
    round. At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first, it
    gets another Will save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each
    creature must receive the same command.</p>
