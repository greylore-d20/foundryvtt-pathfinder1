      <p>Being a renowned hero can be dangerous to your health and prosperity.
      Fighting against corruption and the evil that lurks within society makes
      you a target and, even worse, puts your friends and family in danger. For
      those who must maintain a social persona, being a part of the greater
      community while secretly fighting against powerful forces within it
      requires leading a double life.</p>

      <p>By day, the vigilante maneuvers through society, dealing with other
      nobles or influential individuals. By night, he dons a disguise and an
      utterly different set of goals, taking the fight to his foes and solving
      problems with a blade when words will not suffice.</p>

      <p>Game Masters should consider carefully whether or not a vigilante will
      make for a good fit with their campaign. The class is one that requires a
      degree of social aptitude and roleplaying to make full use of its
      potential.</p>

      <p>Campaigns that focus more on wilderness exploration, travel, or dungeon
      delving and that are lighter on politics, negotiation, and manipulation
      might require a vigilante player to put in additional effort to make full
      use of his class features. Alternatively, a vigilante is uniquely suited
      to make for a powerful villain, hidden by day behind a mask of civility
      and a terror at night, free to commit terrible acts without risking
      discovery.</p>

      <p>For players, the vigilante offers a unique opportunity to take on the
      role of a character with a hidden side, and whose life is committed to a
      secret agenda that he must struggle to advance in a complex world. Not
      every problem can be solved with a dagger in the dark, and even the most
      stubborn foe might be become an ally with the proper bribe. For the
      vigilante, these tasks are both within reach as long as you learn to
      properly use your dual nature and hidden skills to your fullest
      advantage.</p>

      <p>Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for
      the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king’s
      newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are
      those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are
      willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others.</p>

      <p>Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to
      take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in
      plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning
      alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around
      them.</p>

      <p>Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some
      criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become
      terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda.
      In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures—the face that
      everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most
      are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly
      intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish
      warriors in dangerous environments.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: Any.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 5d6 × 10 (average 175 gp).</p>
