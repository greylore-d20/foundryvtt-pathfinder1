  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target can observe for 1 full round a lock that he is aware of (or
      object that includes a lock, such as a chest or door) that is within 60
      feet to automatically determine whether it is open, closed, or jammed. If
      the target creature is trained in Disable Device, by concentrating on a
      lock for 3 rounds, he can also determine the quality of the lock (simple,
      average, good, or superior). This spell does not enable the target to see
      hidden locks, such as those on secret doors.</p>
