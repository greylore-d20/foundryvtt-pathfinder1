  shortDescription: >-
    <p>With this spell, you create shafts of blue light that illuminate all
    undead creatures in the area. Affected undead take a -20 penalty on all
    Stealth checks. Invisible undead are not made visible by this effect, but
    the light does make it easy to pinpoint the exact squares in which such
    undead are located (they still retain the 50% miss chance granted by
    invisibility).</p><p>The <i>light of Iomedae</i> increases light levels by
    one step in a 5-foot radius around an affected undead creature. Once an
    undead is affected, it remains illuminated as long as remains within the
    spell's range, even if it leaves the spell's original radius, until the
    spell's duration ends.</p><p>Affected undead must also make a Will save when
    they are first illuminated by the <i>light of Iomedae</i>. Those who fail
    this save lose all benefits of channel resistance and take a -2 penalty on
    all saving throws made against positive energy effects.</p>
