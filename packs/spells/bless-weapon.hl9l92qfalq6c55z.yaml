  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The
    weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of
    bypassing the DR of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures
    (though the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon
    also becomes good-aligned, which means it can bypass the DR of certain
    creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the
    weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but
    affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't confer the benefit to the
    projectiles they shoot.</p><p>In addition, all critical hit rolls against
    evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit.
    This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical
    effect related to critical hits, such as a <i>keen</i> weapon or a <i>vorpal
    sword</i>.</p>
