  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your
      hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks
      with the <i>flame blade</i> are melee touch attacks.</p><p>The blade deals
      1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10).
      Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to
      the damage. A <i>flame blade</i> can ignite combustible materials such as
      parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.</p>
