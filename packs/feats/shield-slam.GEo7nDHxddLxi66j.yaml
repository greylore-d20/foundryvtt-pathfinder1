    value: >-
      <i>In the right position, your shield can be used to send opponents
      flying.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Improved Shield Bash, Shield Proficiency, Two-Weapon Fighting, base
      attack bonus +6.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>Any opponents hit by your shield bash are also hit with a free bull
      rush attack, substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check
      (see Combat). This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
      Opponents who cannot move back due to a wall or other surface are knocked
      prone after moving the maximum possible distance. You may choose to move
      with your target if you are able to take a 5-foot step or to spend an
      action to move this turn.</p>
