  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman grants a creature within 30 feet a bit of good luck for 1
      round. The target can call upon this good luck once per round, allowing it
      to reroll any ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check,
      taking the better result. The target creature must decide to use this
      ability before the first roll is made.</p>

      <p>At 8th and 16th levels, the duration of this hex increases by 1
      round.</p>

      <p>Once a creature has benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit
      from it again for 24 hours.</p>
