      <p>You are a blight on the natural world. Bizarre natural hazards develop
      within a 300-ft radius around you whenever you linger in a natural area
      for more than 10 minutes, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ug4qh4cuh5f9ralf]{Curse Terrain, Lesser}. You
      cannot choose the hazards or their locations. However, your movement is
      unimpeded by undergrowth, as a <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Druid">druidâ€™s
      woodland stride ability</a>, as plants wither away in your footsteps.</p>

      Ashes} to your list of 2nd-level oracle spells known.</p>
