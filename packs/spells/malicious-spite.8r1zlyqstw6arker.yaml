  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You invoke feelings of a driving malicious intent. The target's malice
      is directed at a second individual as designated by you at the time of
      casting. Thereafter, the target attempts to slander, abuse, and even plot
      murder against the target of its spite. This loathing is not overt, and
      the target's actions against the object of its spite remain subtle and
      indirect.</p><p>The enchanted target remains within its financial and
      ethical means when acting against the second individual, though the malice
      toward this other person pushes the target to the limit of what it would
      do to a hated individual.</p><p>Each day, the target takes 2 points of
      Wisdom damage as the all-encompassing spite dominates its thoughts. The
      target can only alleviate the ability damage by acting upon the emotion
      and performing a spiteful act. Examples of spiteful acts are spiking the
      target's drink to make it an easier target for thugs, damaging the
      target's property, starting foul rumors about the target, framing the
      target for a crime, paying lepers or beggars to accost the target,
      extorting or blackmailing the target, or arranging for others to
      physically harm the target.</p><p>When the spell ends, the target
      remembers the spiteful behavior, but not the motivation for it.</p>
