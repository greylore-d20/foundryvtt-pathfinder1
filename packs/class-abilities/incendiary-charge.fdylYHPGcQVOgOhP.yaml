  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An incendiary charge is a bomb specifically designed to overcome the
      effects of any nonmagical objectâ€™s hardness. As a full-round action, the
      alchemist can place an incendiary charge that burns and eats away at an
      object, dealing normal bomb damage to it. (The damage is not halved
      against an object with hardness, unlike most energy damage.) Furthermore,
      the incendiary charge ignores the first 5 points of hardness of the
      material being damaged.</p><p>The alchemist must be at least 4th level
      before selecting this discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link
