      <p>You create a light wind that blows against the target, from a direction
      of your choice. The breeze grants the subject a +2 bonus on saves against
      very hot conditions, severe heat, breath weapons, and saves against cloud
      vapors and gases (such as cloudkill, stinking cloud, and inhaled poisons).
      This spell does not function without air or underwater.</p><p>You can only
      have one breeze active at any one time. If you cast this spell while
      another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled.</p>
