  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you can manipulate the dreamscape of others, drawing
      forth or tampering with their subconscious minds. This power allows you to
      tamper with the targetâ€™s memories as if
      using@Compendium[pf1.spells.5ll7q13p0skbgonc]{Modify Memory}, or you may
      ask questions as if using @Compendium[pf1.spells.byn5q46du0ck592a]{Speak
      with Dead} upon a corpse. A successful <em>Will</em> save negates the
      effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level +
      your <em>Charisma</em> modifier, with further modifiers as the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.siv3ub7hbmcklf8c]{Nightmare} spell. You can use
      this ability once per day at 9th level. At 17th level you can use this
      ability twice per day, and at 20th, three times per day.</p>
