      <p>Shears are used to quickly cut through items by snipping them between
      two sharp blades fitted with a spring to allow the jaws to open again
      after closing. Small shears can be used in one hand and are often used to
      trim hair, cut cloth, or perform other delicate cutting work. Lopping
      shears are 3 feet long and must be used in two hands; they are commonly
      used by farmers or gardeners to cut hedges and branches.</p>

      <p><em>Adamantine</em> shears are lopping shears with sharpened
      <em>adamantine</em> blades that can snip through nearly any material.</p>

      <p>You can use <em>adamantine</em> shears to cut through bars, chains,
      grates, or similar items, dealing damage to such objects as though using a
      <em>scimitar</em> and bypassing <em>hardness</em> less than 20.</p>

      <p>On any item the <em>adamantine</em> shears can fit around (such as a
      <em>chain</em> or iron bar, but not an iron door), using
      <em>adamantine</em> shears provides a +10 bonus on your <em>Strength</em>
      check to break or burst it.</p>
