      Groups</b> Blades, Heavy</p><h3>Description</h3><p>An estoc is a sword
      about as long as a bastard sword, but designed exclusively for thrusting
      attacks. Its "blade" is a steel spike with a triangular, square, or
      hexagonal crosssection. Like the bastard sword, an estoc requires special
      training to use it one handed, but it can also be wielded as a two-handed
      martial weapon. When you wield an estoc with one hand, treat it as a
      one-handed weapon; when you wield an estoc with two hands, treat it as a
      two-handed weapon. If you can use the estoc proficiently with one hand,
      you can also use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier
      instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls when wielding an estoc
      sized for you with one or two hands, even though it isn't a light
      weapon.</p>
