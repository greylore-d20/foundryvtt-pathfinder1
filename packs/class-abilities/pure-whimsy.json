      "value": "<p>Once per day, you can release a stream of errant chaos from the First World as a standard action. When you do so, identify a target within 90 feet and generate a random effect as from a&nbsp;rod of wonder&nbsp;(or, at the GMâ€™s discretion, another random or unusual effect of similar power). The DC of any required saving throw is 10 + half your oracle level + your Charisma modifier, and no effect from this ability persists for more than 1 day.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability once per day at 7th level and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 7th. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
