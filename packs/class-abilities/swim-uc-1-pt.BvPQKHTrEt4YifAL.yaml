    value: >-
      <p>The eidolon gains webbed hands, webbed feet, or powerful flippers,
      giving it a swim speed equal to its base speed. This evolution does not
      give the eidolon the ability to breathe underwater.</p>

      <p>This evolution can be selected more than once. Each additional time it
      is selected, increase the eidolonâ€™s swim speed by 20 feet.</p>
