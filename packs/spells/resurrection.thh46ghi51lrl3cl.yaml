      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.c5anior2ysy6s2xy]{raise dead}, except
      that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased
      creature.</p><p>The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as
      some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be
      resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of
      the creature's body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit
      by a <em>disintegrate</em> spell count as a small portion of its body.)
      The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster
      level.</p><p>Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately
      restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared
      spells.</p><p>The subject of the spell gains one permanent negative level
      when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining
      creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution
      drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be
      resurrected).</p><p>You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or
      someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then
      destroyed.</p><p>You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age.
      Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be
      resurrected.</p>
