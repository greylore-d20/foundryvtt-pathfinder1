    value: >-
      <p>The witch can use this hex to turn a humanoid enemy into an animal and
      rob it of its free will.</p><p>The transformation works as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.774kmgcb7ygviht0]{Beast Shape II} and is negated by
      a successful Will save. The transformed creature retains its Intelligence
      score and known languages, if any, but the witch controls its
      mind.</p><p>This effect functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.66s5qm8kwycgobce]{Dominate Monster}, except the
      creature does not receive further saving throws to resist the
      hex.</p><p>The effect can be removed only with wish or similar magic,
      although slaying the witch also ends the effect.</p><p>Whether or not the
      save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for
      1 day.</p>
