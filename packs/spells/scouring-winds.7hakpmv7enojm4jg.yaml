  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell brings forth a windstorm of stinging sand that blocks all
      vision. You can move the storm up to 30 feet each round as a move action. 
      Any creature in the area takes 3d6 points of piercing damage each round.
      The area is considered a windstorm (see Table 13-10: Wind Effects, <i>Core
      Rulebook</i> 439).  If a creature with spell resistance successfully
      resists this spell, it is unaffected by the winds and sand, but still
      unable to see within the area of the spell.</p>
