  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You transform the target's fins, flippers, or tail into legs and feet,
      allowing it to walk on land. The target loses its swim speed but gains a
      base speed appropriate for a humanoid of its size (speed 30 if a Medium or
      larger creature, speed 20 if Small). If the creature is immersed in water
      for 1 round, the transformation reverts, allowing it to swim normally. One
      round after leaving the water, the transformation occurs again, allowing
      it to walk.  This spell only works on merfolk, tritons, seals, fish, and
      other creatures whose bodies or limbs are used mainly for swimming and are
      not suitable for walking. It does not give the target the ability to
      breathe air.</p>
