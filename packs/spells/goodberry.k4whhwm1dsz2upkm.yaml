    value: >-
      <p>Casting <i>goodberry</i> makes 2d4 freshly picked berries magical. You
      (as well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level) can immediately
      discern which berries are affected. Each transmuted berry provides
      nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature.</p><p>The
      berry also cures 1 point of damage when eaten, subject to a maximum of 8
      points of such curing in any 24-hour period.</p>
