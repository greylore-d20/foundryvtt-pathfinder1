  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Ice encrusts the ground, radiating supernatural cold and making it hard
      for creatures to maintain their balance. This icy ground is treated as
      normal ice, forcing creatures to spend 2 squares of movement to enter an
      icy square and increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks in the area by 5. A
      creature that begins its turn in the affected area takes 1d6 points of
      cold damage and takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells with
      the cold descriptor for 1 round.</p>
