  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You magically scour the world's libraries for information that might
    refresh your memory about a topic. Upon casting this spell, the focus book's
    pages fill with snippets and selections from countless books. You can spend
    up to 1 round per caster level (maximum 10) reading these notes. You may
    cease reading at any time, and when you do you can immediately attempt one
    Knowledge check with a +1 circumstance bonus for each round you spent
    studying the book (maximum +10). The writing disappears when the spell ends,
    and if you fail to succeed at a Knowledge check on the round you stop
    reading the notes, you don't gain the benefits of this spell.</p>
