    value: >-
      <p>If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself
      effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra
      damage.</p>

      <p>The rogue’s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be
      denied a <em>Dexterity</em> bonus to <em>AC</em> (whether the target
      actually has a <em>Dexterity</em> bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks
      her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6
      every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a <em>critical
      hit</em> with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged
      attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30
      feet.</p>

      <p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an
      unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal
      damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal
      damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual
      –4 penalty.</p>

      <p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a
      vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak
      attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>
