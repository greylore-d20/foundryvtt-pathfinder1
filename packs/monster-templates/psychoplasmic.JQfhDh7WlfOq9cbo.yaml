      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>While nearly all spirits experience
      the Astral Plane at some point in their cosmic journeys, it is still one
      of the least understood planes in the multiverse. Some say it is merely a
      dream of the gods, while others contend it is the realm of thought itself.
      Though it is a seemingly endless realm of celestial desert, creatures
      still roam and hunt on its infinite expanse.<p>Among the strangest are the
      psychoplasmic creatures that spontaneously form on the Astral Plane in no
      perceivable pattern. It could be that when a soul gets caught up in some
      form of astral eddy, its essence and the strange energies of the Astral
      Plane fuse to create this bizarre form of life. Some suggest that the
      passage of souls through the plane leaves impressions behind, the most
      powerful of which manifest as beings unto themselves. The most outlandish
      philosophies theorize that since the Astral Plane is a plane of thought,
      maybe a great thinker exists somewhere beyond the expanse, and these
      creatures are physical embodiments of its will.<p>Whatever the nature of a
      psychoplasmic creature’s genesis, it retains much of its knowledge of its
      former life, if any, but is extremely emotionally dulled. It cares nothing
      for its past, and instead takes on a mission or a task that it must
      complete, but usually without knowing why. Those who believe that the
      Astral Plane is both the incarnation of thought and also a thinker believe
      that these creatures always do the bidding of that astral mind. The
      evidence is scant, as there seems to be little rhyme or reason to
      individual psychoplasmic creatures’ actions. Instead, they seem
      inexplicably fixated on random things; while a few eventually change the
      nature of their obsessions, such refocusing is rare. Some of the most
      common tasks that psychoplasmic creatures propel themselves toward include
      hunting down beasts or beings that they never could have bested in life,
      exploring or drawing other creatures toward areas of the Astral Planes
      where few have ever tread, and giving themselves over to the service of
      psychic masters to whom they are inexplicably attuned.<p>The one common
      thread between all psychoplasmic creatures is their substance and
      appearance. Though they keep the forms they once held (or were molded to
      resemble), they seem to be composed of a large, constantly shifting clump
      of silvery dust. This dust continuously drifts from a psychoplasmic
      creature’s form, dissipating into nothing. Yet as fast as it falls, it is
      replaced, leaving the creature’s size unchanged even after decades or
      centuries of such evaporation. The strange dust of a psychoplasmic
      creature’s form completely disappears only after the creature fulfills its
      inscrutable objective.<p>Psychoplasmic creatures come in many forms. Many
      are large, hulking brutes that stalk those who invade or defile the Astral
      Plane, sometimes tracking trespassers to the Material Plane (though their
      mobility is diminished there). Others are more intelligent and serve as
      advisors and companions to shulsagas (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</em>
      245). These beings might be treated as anything from valued members of a
      shulsaga community to embodiments of heroes or entire shulsaga tribes lost
      and reborn. Others, however, wage war on shulsagas, and are widely
      perceived as the psychic vengeance of deadly foes or mighty beasts from
      their mythology. In any case, the known power of psychoplasmic creatures
      has impacted shulsagas’ culture and art, and they dust many of their most
      sacred sites and most impressive pieces of statuary in silvery powder, to
      suggest suggesting the adaptability and might of psychoplasmic
      creatures.<p>A select few psychoplasmic creatures serve the interests of
      the Boneyard—though it can be difficult to tell whether that is
      intentional or incidental. Psychopomps keep these astral denizens at arm’s
      length, but nonetheless welcome their aid in their eternal vigil over the
      River of Souls. Many psychopomps remain skeptical of the strange
      creatures’ agenda, though, suspecting that these psychoplasmic allies are
      spying on or undermining their comrades. Regardless, no accounts tell of
      psychoplasmic creatures serving predators of souls, such as
      daemons.<p>Still other psychoplasmic creatures wander the planes, fixated
      on whatever was embedded in their minds when they came into being. A
      strange few seem to be born without any ambition beyond a nameless urge to
      wander the multiverse in search of adventure before they finally dissipate
      back into the silvery void of the Astral Plane.<p>“Psychoplasmic” is an
      acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than
      an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature.<p><b>Challenge
      Rating</b>: Base creature’s CR + 1.<p><b>Alignment</b>: Usually
      neutral.<p><b>Type</b>: The creature’s type changes to outsider. Do not
      recalculate the base creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points.
      It retains any subtype and gains the augmented subtype. It uses all the
      base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted in the
      following sections.<p><b>Armor Class</b>: A psychoplasmic creature gains a
      natural armor bonus of +2. If it already has a natural armor bonus, that
      bonus increases by 2.<p><b>Hit Dice</b>: Change all of the creature’s
      racial Hit Dice to d10s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain
      unchanged.<p><b>Defensive Abilities</b>: A psychoplasmic creature gains an
      amount of spell resistance equal to its CR + 5. Psychic spells bypass this
      spell resistance.<p><b>Damage Reduction and Energy Resistance</b>: A
      psychoplasmic creature gains damage reduction and energy resistance based
      on its Hit Dice, as given in the table below.

      <p><br><b>Speed:</b> Psychoplasmic creatures gain a fly speed of 60 feet
      (perfect) while on the Astral Plane.<p><b>Attacks:</b> A psychoplasmic
      creature retains all natural weapons of the base creature. It gains a slam
      attack that deals damage based on the ectoplasmic creature’s
      size.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A psychoplasmic creature retains all of
      the special attacks of the base creature. In addition, a psychoplasmic
      creature gains the following special attack.<p><em>Mindlock (Su):</em>
      Upon successfully making an unarmed strike or natural attack against a
      creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, a psychoplasmic
      creature can attempt to impose a mindlock on that creature as a free
      action. The target of the mindlock must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC
      = 10 + 1/2 the psychoplasmic creature’s Hit Dice + its Intelligence
      modifier). If the target fails, it cannot cast spells, speak, or use
      Intelligence checks or Intelligence-based skill checks for 1 round (or 1d4
      rounds, if the psychoplasmic creature has 11 Hit Dice or
      more).<p><b>Ability Scores:</b> Dex +4, Int +4.<p><b>Skills:</b> Survival
      is always a class skill for psychoplasmic creatures, and they gain a +5
      racial bonus on Survival check when following tracks.<p><b>Special
      Abilities:</b> The flexible body of a psychoplasmic creature grants it the
      compression ability.</p>
