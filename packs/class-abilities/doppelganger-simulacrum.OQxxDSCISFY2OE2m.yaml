    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist learns how to create a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.bvsi2gzhq49mmt2f]{Simulacrum}, a soulless
      duplicate, into which he can project his consciousness. As a full-round
      action, he may shift his consciousness from his current body to any one of
      his available doppelganger simulacra, which must be on the same plane as
      the alchemist. If killed in a simulacrum, he transfers to his own body
      automatically; if killed in his own body, he is dead. Unused simulacra
      (including his abandoned original body) appear to be lifeless corpses,
      though they do not decay.</p>

      <p>Creating a duplicate costs 1,000 gp in alchemical materials and
      requires 1 week to grow.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the alchemical
      simulacrum discovery before selecting this discovery. The created
      simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.</p>
