  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as
      noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a
      +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>

      <p>Every four levels thereafter (9th*, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes
      further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack
      and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the
      bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For
      example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on
      attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and
      damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted
      from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a
      weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>

      <p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with
      weapons from his group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat
      Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made
      against weapons from this group.</p>
