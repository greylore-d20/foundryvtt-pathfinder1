    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can unleash a freezing projectile by expending 1 point
      from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one
      target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 points of cold
      damage + the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points
      of cold damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th
      level). In addition, the target is staggered for 1 round. It can attempt a
      Fortitude saving throw to negate the staggered condition.</p>
