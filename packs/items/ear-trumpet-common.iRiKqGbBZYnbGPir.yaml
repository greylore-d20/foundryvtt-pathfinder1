      (masterwork)</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This foot-long brass funnel
      amplifies sounds entering through the broad end for anyone listening at
      the narrow end. The listener gains a +2 circumstance bonus on sound-based
      Perception checks but must use one hand to hold the trumpet to the ear in
      order to gain the benefit. A masterwork ear trumpetâ€™s exquisite acoustic
      properties grant the listener a +4 circumstance bonus instead.</p>
