    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, a kineticist learns to use another element or expands her
      understanding of her own element. She can choose any element, including
      her primary element. She gains one of that element’s simple blast wild
      talents that she does not already possess, if any. She also gains all
      composite blast wild talents whose prerequisites she meets, as well as the
      basic wild talent of her chosen expanded element (for instance, basic
      aerokinesis if she chooses air). She doesn’t gain the defense wild talent
      of the expanded element.<p>If the kineticist’s expanded element is
      different from her primary element, she treats her kineticist level as 4
      levels lower for the purpose of determining which wild talents she can
      learn from her expanded element.<p>If the kineticist chooses to expand her
      understanding of an element she already has, she gains an additional
      utility wild talent or infusion of her choice from that element, as if
      from her infusion or wild talent class feature, as appropriate.<p>At 15th
      level, the kineticist can either select a new element or expand her
      understanding of her original element. She can’t select the same element
      she selected at 7th level unless it is her primary element. She gains all
      the benefits from her new expanded element as listed above. However, if
      the kineticist selected her primary element as her expanded element at
      both 7th and 15th levels, her mastery of that element increases. For wild
      talents of her element, the kineticist gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls
      and damage rolls, as well as to caster level and DCs.</p>
