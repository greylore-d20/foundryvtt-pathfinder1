      <p>This inky paste aids unskilled <em>poison</em>-users. When smeared on

      while applying <em>poison</em> to a weapon, as if the user possessed the
      poison use ability. A single dose of blackfingers paste lasts for 1d6
      hours, but the black stains the stuff creates on the user's fingers lasts
      for days. A single dose of this alchemical item costs 50 gp.</p>
