Whenever you succeed at an Acrobatics check to move through an enemy’s square, you gain a competence bonus equal to half your oracle level (minimum +1) on trip combat maneuvers against that creature until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, you gain @Compendium[pf1.feats.UnmST9BvRhxT4vq3]{Whirlwind Attack} as a bonus feat, and you can make bull rush combat maneuvers in place of any of the attacks granted by Whirlwind Attack; you cannot move with enemies bull rushed this way.</p>"
