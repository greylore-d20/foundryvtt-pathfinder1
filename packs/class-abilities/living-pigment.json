      "value": "<p>The alchemist infuses his inks and dyes with a spark of animating force. As a standard action, he can expend one daily use of his bombs and a 1st-level extract he has prepared to create a creature, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.kyo0kwhw2jhuztju]{Summon Monster I}, using his level as the spell’s caster level. The extract is expended as if the alchemist had consumed it. The alchemist can expend a higher-level extract when using this ability to create a creature using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20monster%201\">summon monster</a>&nbsp;spell of a level equal to the level of extract expended. For example, if the alchemist expends a 4th-level extract, he can create a creature as if using @Compendium[pf1.spells.aqri3zf6mzgd4di6]{Summon Monster IV}. Additionally, the alchemist can expend an additional use of his daily bombs when creating a creature in this way to grant the creature the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterTemplates.aspx?ItemName=Celestial\">celestial</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterTemplates.aspx?ItemName=Fiendish\">fiendish</a>&nbsp;template. The alchemist must have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>"
