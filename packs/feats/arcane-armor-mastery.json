This bonus replaces, and does not stack with, the bonus granted by Arcane Armor Training.<p><strong>Combat Trick</strong><br>When casting a spell while wearing armor, you can spend 1 stamina point to activate Arcane Armor Mastery as a free action, or spend a number of stamina points equal to the spell's level (minimum 1) to ignore your armor's arcane spell failure chance entirely for that casting.</p>"
