As an immediate action when she fails a saving throw against a poison, the rogue can attempt the saving throw a second time. If she succeeds at this second saving throw, the poison does not affect her for a number of rounds equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round), but this time it counts against the poisonâ€™s duration. This talent has no effect on poisons with an onset longer than immediate.</p>"
