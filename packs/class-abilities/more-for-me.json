      "value": "<p>When another character within 30 feet casts a spell with a range greater than touch, you can attempt a caster level check as an immediate action (DC = 15 + the spell’s level). If you succeed at the check, you receive the spell’s benefit instead of one of the spell’s intended targets (chosen by you). If you are already a target of the spell, you are affected as though you were targeted by the same spell twice (which may or may not benefit you; remember that bonuses from the same source do not stack). This ability does not grant you knowledge of the spell being cast. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Copycat power of the Trickery Domain.</p>"
