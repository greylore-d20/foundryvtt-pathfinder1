    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, all of your cure spells are treated as if they were
      empowered, increasing the amount of damage healed by half (+50%). This
      does not apply to damage dealt to undead with a cure spell. This does not
      stack with the Empower Spell metamagic feat.</p>
