    value: >-
      <p>This 50-foot length of tough, lightweight rope is made from
      alchemically treated bloodvine, a rare scarlet-colored vine that grows
      only in warm jungle environments. Though prized by climbers for its
      durability, bloodvine can also be used to bind creatures. Bloodvine rope
      has a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points, and can be broken with a DC 30
      Strength check. A creature bound by bloodvine rope can escape with a DC 35
      Escape Artist check or a DC 30 Strength
      check.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC
