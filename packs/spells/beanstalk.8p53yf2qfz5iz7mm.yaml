  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When casting this spell, you must plant the material components in
      soil. When you do, at the end of casting, a large beanstalk rises up from
      the ground. It's strong enough to support Huge or smaller creatures
      weighing no more than 2,000 pounds total, and has enough handholds and
      footholds that it can be climbed as if it were knotted rope (Climb DC 5).
      At the end of the spell's duration, the beanstalk withers and dies at an
      accelerated rate, leaving nothing more than a pile of compost.</p>
