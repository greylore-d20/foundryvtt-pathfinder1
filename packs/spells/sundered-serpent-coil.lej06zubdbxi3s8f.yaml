  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>black tentacles</i>, except it creates a
      Large decapitated snake, which erupts from the ground and grapples a
      creature you specify within its 5-foot reach. As a standard action, you
      can command the snake to release its grappled target and direct it to
      attack a different creature.</p>
