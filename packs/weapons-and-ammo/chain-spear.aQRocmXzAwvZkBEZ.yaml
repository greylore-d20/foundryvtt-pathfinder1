  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This vicious weapon is often used in gladiatorial events due to its
      versatility. The body of the weapon is a standard short spear, primarily
      used for thrusting. The butt of the spear is fitted with a length of
      chain, often spiked, with a hook at the end. The hook and chain may be
      used to make trip attacks. If your trip attack fails by 10 or more, you
      may drop the chain spear to avoid being knocked prone.</p>
