      "value": "<p>The first time each round that you deal sneak attack damage to an opponent, you can forgo sneak attack damage to distract the creature. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of sneak attack dice sacrificed + your Charisma modifier) or become distracted until the start of your next turn. Distracted opponents are entirely focused on you, and pay little attention to their surroundings; they are not considered to be observing other characters within 30 feet, allowing them to attempt Stealth checks to hide. A distracted opponent automatically fails Perception checks against creatures more than 30 feet away.</p>"
