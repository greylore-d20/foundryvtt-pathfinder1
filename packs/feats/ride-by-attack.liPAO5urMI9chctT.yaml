    value: >-
      <i>While mounted and charging, you can move, strike at a foe, and then
      continue moving.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack
      as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight
      line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can't exceed double
      your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of
      opportunity from the opponent that you attack.</p>
