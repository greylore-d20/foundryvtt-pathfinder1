The awkwardness of the configuration means you do not gain the bonus on Sleight of Hand checks that either of those stand-alone weapons grants. The dagger pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon.</p>\n<p>If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the dagger component are considered broken. A dagger pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p>\n<p>This is an early firearm.</p>"
