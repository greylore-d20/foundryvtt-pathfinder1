      <p>You cause a single object to temporarily gain the broken condition. The
      target must be a single solid object, regardless of its composition,
      weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Attended objects are allowed a
      Fortitude save. When this spell ends, the object reverts to its original
      quality. An item destroyed while under the effects of this spell remains
      destroyed when this spell ends.  This spell can be cast on a single
      construct to disrupt its animating force. A construct that fails its
      saving throw takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving
      throws, skill checks, and ability checks for the duration of the
      spell.</p>
