  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You direct spirits into the shadows of creatures. The shadows of
    creatures that fail their Will saving throws appear slightly different for
    the duration of the spell, bearing small horns, unusually long and slender
    arms, or other small discrepancies. This spell does not work on creatures
    that do not cast shadows or reflections. At will as an immediate action (but
    no more often than once every 10 minutes), a <i>mischievous shadow</i> can
    interfere with its host's actions or the actions of adjacent creatures by
    interacting with their shadows in ways that affect their physical
    counterparts, such as grabbing the shadow of a crossbow to redirect the
    physical weapon's aim. Each disruption either imposes a -8 penalty on a
    single attack roll, combat maneuver check, or Strength- or Dexterity-based
    skill check, or requires a spellcaster to succeed at a concentration check
    (DC = 15 + spell level) or lose a spell being cast. If you are within range
    of the spell effect, you can decide how these shadows interfere; otherwise,
    their actions are timed and decided by the GM as needed, typically
    manifesting during important or crucial roles. Each time a <i>mischievous
    shadow</i> makes such a disruption, the spell's haunt-like manifestation
    occurs during that round.</p>
