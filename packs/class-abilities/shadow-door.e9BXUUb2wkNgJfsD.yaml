      <p>At 16th level, you can take any part of your movement through shadows,
      teleporting to another location within 60 feet. This ability functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{Dimension Door}, except you canâ€™t
      use shadow door in brightly lit areas. You can teleport in this manner a
      total of 10 feet per class level each day.</p>
