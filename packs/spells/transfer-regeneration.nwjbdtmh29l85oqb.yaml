  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You bestow your regenerative abilities on the target. Your regeneration
      stops functioning for the duration of the spell, and the target gains your
      regeneration. For example, if you have regeneration 5 (acid or fire), your
      target gains regeneration 5 (acid or fire). This regeneration overlaps
      (does not stack) with any regeneration the creature already has, including
      other castings of this spell. This spell has no effect if you don't have
      the regeneration ability or your regeneration isn't functioning when you
      cast the spell.</p>
