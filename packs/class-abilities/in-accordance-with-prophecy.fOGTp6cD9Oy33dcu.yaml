      <p>A number of times per day equal to your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier,
      you can publicly declare that your next spell is guided by prophecy. When
      you do, the next spell you cast has a 20% chance of fizzling (1–20 on a
      d%). If the spell does not fail, treat the spell as if it had been
      modified by the @Compendium[pf1.feats.77gXSucrxfrE9yWk]{Empower Spell}
      feat, even if you do not have that feat. At 12th level, the chance that
      the spell fizzles is reduced to 15% (1–15 on a d%). At 16th level, the
      chance is reduced to 10% (1–10 on a d%).</p>
