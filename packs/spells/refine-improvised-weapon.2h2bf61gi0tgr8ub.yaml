    value: >-
      <p>You transform an improvised weapon into an equivalent simple or martial
      weapon of masterwork quality. This does not alter the weapon's shape or
      appearance in any way. For example, if this spell is cast on a chair leg,
      a butter knife, or a pitchfork, the items function as a masterwork club, a
      masterwork dagger, or a masterwork trident, respectively, but the items
      look no different than they did before the spell was cast.</p>
