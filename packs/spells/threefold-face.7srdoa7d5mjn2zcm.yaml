  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You grow two additional faces set equidistantly around your head, each
      embodying a different aspect of your personality that you choose (such as
      kindliness, joy, or wrath). You gain all-around vision and can't be
      flanked. Effects that would blind you, deafen you, block your mouth, or
      otherwise affect your face, including beneficial effects that grant you
      exceptional vision, only affect a single face (for example, it would take
      three castings of <i>blindness/ deafness</i> to blind you). You lose
      all-around vision if even a single face becomes blind. This spell doesn't
      grant you additional magic item slots or additional heads. When
      <i>threefold face</i> ends, you gain all the conditions from all three
      faces, for good or ill.</p>
