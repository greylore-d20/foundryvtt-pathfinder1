      Engine</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Trebuchets are similar in form to
      catapults, with the payload placed into a basket, cup, or sling at the end
      of a long lever, and a counterweight (often with crew or animals pulling
      attached ropes) close to the fulcrum. The leverage imparted by a trebuchet
      allows it to hurl massive missiles that scatter to a number of squares
      around the target square based on the size of the trebuchet. Trebuchets
      are too bulky to move on wheels or vehicles and must be assembled on the
      battlefield. Trebuchets have a minimum range of 150
      feet.</p><p><em>Light</em>: These Large siege engines typically hurl large
      stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 15). A light trebuchet's
      ammunition scatters on contact, dealing full damage to the target square
      and half its damage to creatures and objects within 5 feet of the target
      square (creatures can make a DC 15 Reflex save to halve the damage again).
      Light trebuchets have a hardness of 5 and 50 hit points. One use of light
      trebuchet stones costs 15 gp and weighs 60 pounds.</p>
