    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist can create special poisons that are more effective
      against certain creatures. When crafting a poison, the alchemist can
      choose a single creature type (and subtype, if appropriate) from the <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ranger">ranger’s
      favored enemy list</a>. Against creatures of the chosen type, the poison’s
      saving throw DC is increased by 4. Against all other creatures, it is
      reduced by 2. The alchemist must choose the creature type and subtype (if
      appropriate) while crafting the poison and afterward cannot change this
      choice.</p>
