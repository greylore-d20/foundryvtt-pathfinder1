You become immune to fear spells and effects and to the confused condition.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you can choose a willing creature that is either within 30 feet or in telepathic contact with you. For 1 round per psychic level you possess, you suppress any fear effect or confused, cowering, frightened, panicked, or shaken condition affecting that creature.</p>\n<p>You can suppress only one effect at a time with this ability, and choosing a new target ends the suppression for the character you previously chose.</p>"
