  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When an arcanist uses the flame arc exploit, she can spend 1 additional
      point from her arcane reservoir to draw the flames from Hell. If she does
      so, half of the damage she deals is fire, and the other half results
      directly from unholy power that is not subject to fire resistance. Good
      creatures that take damage from a hellfire ray must succeed at a Will
      saving throw or be sickened for 1d4 rounds.</p>
