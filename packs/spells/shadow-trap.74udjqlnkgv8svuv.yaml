    value: >-
      <p>You pin the target's shadow to its current location, causing the target
      to become entangled and preventing it from moving farther than 5 feet from
      its original position, as if its shadow were anchored to the terrain. Each
      round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the
      effect as a full-round action. A flying creature can only hover in place
      or fall while entangled in this manner. This spell automatically fails
      when cast on a creature that doesn't throw a shadow, and it ends if the
      creature is entirely in an area with no illumination.</p>
