  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These metal caps must be specially fitted to a creature’s horns or
      tusks; a blade reminiscent of a sword or axe head projects from each
      cap.</p><p>If the creature makes a gore attack (including as part of a
      powerful charge), the attack deals both piercing and slashing damage, and
      has a critical threat range of 19–20 (this range can be increased by other
      effects).</p><p>Tusk blades can be enhanced as melee weapons; the
      enhancement is applied to the creature’s gore attack.</p>
