    value: >-
      <p>When the psychic undercasts a spell (see page 144), she can spend
      points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell’s effective level,
      essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level
      version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She
      can’t use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she
      knows. For instance, a psychic who knows mind thrust III but not mind
      thrust IV could cast mind thrust II and spend 2 points to treat it as mind
      thrust III, but couldn’t spend 4 points to treat it as mind thrust IV.</p>

      <p>This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be
      undercast.</p>
