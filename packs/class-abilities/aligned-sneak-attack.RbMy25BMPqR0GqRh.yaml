    value: >-
      <p><strong>Source</strong> Distant Realms pg. 13</p><p>When making a sneak
      attack against a creature that has damage reduction that can be overcome
      by weapons of a particular alignment (such as DR 5/good), the rogue’s
      attack reduces that damage reduction by an amount equal to the number of
      sneak attack dice rolled until the end of the rogue’s turn.</p>
