  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>whispering wind</i>, except it can carry
      responses and doesn't end after delivering its first message. After the
      wind completes its initial message, it waits for 1 round, then copies what
      it hear, and returns at the same speed and by the same route. It delivers
      what it heard to the location where the spell was originally cast. The
      wind continues back and forth in this way until the duration ends or the
      spell is dismissed.</p>
