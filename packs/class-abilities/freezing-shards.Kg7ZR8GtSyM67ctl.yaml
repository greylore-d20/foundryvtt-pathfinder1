      <p>As a standard action, you can cause shards of ice to burst forth from
      the ground around you. The shards deal 1d4 points of piercing damage and
      1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every 2 wizard levels you have to
      all creatures within 5 feet of you. A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 +
      half your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the piercing
      damage and halves the cold damage. The shards remain until the beginning
      of your next turn; during this time, the area is difficult terrain. You
      are not affected by your own freezing shards and can move through the area
      normally. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Intelligence modifier.</p>
