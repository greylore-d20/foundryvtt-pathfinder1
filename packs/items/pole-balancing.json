      "value": "\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 8 sp; <b>Weight</b> 12 lbs.</p>\r\n<p>This flexible pole can be anywhere from 15 to 30 feet in length. When used properly, it helps you keep your balance when crossing narrow walkways. Using a balancing pole grants you a +1 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a> on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a> checks made to traverse a narrow surface.</p>\r\n<p>Poles (of all sorts) are also commonly used to probe for hidden or obscured things in nearby spaces, or to trigger location-based traps. If you vault with a pole as part of a running jump, you gain a +2 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a> on your <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a> check (but must let go of the pole in the process). A pole can also prop doors open or closed, serve as a place to hang a lantern or secure a bound foe, or be used as a lever to lift a heavy object up to 5 feet away.</p>\r\n\r\n"
