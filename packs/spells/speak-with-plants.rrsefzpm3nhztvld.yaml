  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures, and can ask
      questions of and receive answers from them. A normal plant's sense of its
      surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize)
      detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events
      outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make plant creatures any
      more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning
      plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid
      ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is friendly, it may do
      some favor or service for you.</p>
