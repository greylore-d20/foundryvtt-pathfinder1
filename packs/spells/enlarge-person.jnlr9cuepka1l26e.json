    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.</p><p>A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed.</p><p>If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it-the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.</p><p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly <i>enlarged</i> by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see page 145). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any <i>enlarged</i> item that leaves an <i>enlarged</i> creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical properties of <i>enlarged</i> items are not increased by this spell.</p><p>Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.</p><p><i>Enlarge person</i> counters and dispels <i>reduce person</i>.</p><p><i>Enlarge person</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>"
