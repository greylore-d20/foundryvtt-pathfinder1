      <p>This spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.o6vh3lrmi1hsdzmm]{Instant Summons}, except that you
      can target multiple objects. You must use a separate sapphire worth 1,000
      gp for each one. For each item you target, you can touch a creature,
      granting that creature the ability to speak the special word for that item
      (each item has its own special word) while crushing the matched gem to
      call the item to hand. Only you or the touched creature can activate the
      gem or see the <em>arcane mark</em> upon it.</p>
