      <p>This glass container of foul-smelling oil shatters easily upon impact.
      You can throw a vial of stink oil as a <em>splash weapon</em> with a range
      increment of 10 feet. If a creature with the <em>scent</em> ability is
      standing in the square of impact, it must succeed at a DC 14
      <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>nauseated</em> for 1d4+1 rounds. Any
      creature with <em>scent</em> in an adjacent square must succeed at a DC 12
      <em>Fortitude</em> save or be <em>sickened</em> for 1 round. Creatures
      without the <em>scent</em> ability are not affected by stink oil.</p>
