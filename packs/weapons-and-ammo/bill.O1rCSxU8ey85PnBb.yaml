    value: >-
      <p>The blade of this polearm is a curved or hooked chopping blade with a
      spiked projection on the back of the blade. The spike is commonly used to
      block and parry. When fighting defensively or with full defense, this
      weapon gives you a +1 shield bonus to AC. A mounted opponent hit by a bill
      takes a -1 penalty on his Ride check to stay mounted.</p>
