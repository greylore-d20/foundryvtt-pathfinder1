      <p>Used in siege warfare, these blinders restrict the <em>owlbear's</em>
      vision to directly where its head is pointing, helping to stop the
      <em>owlbear</em> from getting distracted and allowing the rider to focus
      its attention. This gives the rider a +2 equipment bonus to <em>Ride</em>
      checks made to control the <em>owlbear</em>, but gives the
      <em>owlbear</em> a -2 penalty to <em>Perception</em> checks.</p>
