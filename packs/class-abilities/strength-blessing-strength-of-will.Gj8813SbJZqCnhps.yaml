      <p>At 10th level, as a swift action you can ignore the movement penalties
      caused by wearing medium or heavy armor or by carrying a medium or heavy
      load. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you can add your
      Strength modifier on saving throws against effects that would cause you to
      become entangled, staggered, or paralyzed.</p>
