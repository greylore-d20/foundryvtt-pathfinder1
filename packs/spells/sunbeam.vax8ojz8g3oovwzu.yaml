      <p>For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action to evoke
      a dazzling beam of intense light each round. You can call forth one beam
      per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th level). The spell ends
      when its duration runs out or your allotment of beams is
      exhausted.</p><p>Each creature in the beam is blinded and takes 4d6 points
      of damage. Any creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take
      double damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces
      the damage by half.</p><p>An undead creature caught within the beam takes
      1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage if a
      Reflex save is successful. In addition, the beam results in the
      destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if
      it fails its save.</p><p>The ultraviolet light generated by the spell
      deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead
      creatures.</p>
