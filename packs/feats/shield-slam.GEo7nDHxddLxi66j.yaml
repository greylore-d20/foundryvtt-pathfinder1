    value: >-
      <p><em>In the right position, your shield can be used to send opponents
      flying.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.qYv70Ch9RQfi1LQQ]{Improved Shield Bash},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.WZj7zDvuelEoeXWX]{Shield Proficiency},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.Ee7JHADKEK37tTHs]{Two-Weapon Fighting},
      base attack bonus +6.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Any opponents hit
      by your shield bash are also hit with a free bull rush attack,
      substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check (see Combat).
      This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Opponents who
      cannot move back due to a wall or other surface are knocked prone after
      moving the maximum possible distance. You may choose to move with your
      target if you are able to take a 5-foot step or to spend an action to move
      this turn.</p>
