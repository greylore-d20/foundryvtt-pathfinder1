      <p>You make the target an asymptomatic carrier for a host of virulent
      diseases. Creatures that end their turn adjacent to the target must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or be affected as if by the spell
      <i>contagion</i>. The target itself does not become diseased, and suffers
      no ill effects from this spell. Once <i>plague bearer</i> ends, the target
      is no longer contagious, though any creature it infected remains
      diseased.</p>
