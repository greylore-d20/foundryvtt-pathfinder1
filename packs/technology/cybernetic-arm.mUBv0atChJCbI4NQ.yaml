      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>

      2</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A cybernetic arm completely replaces a normal
      arm, from the shoulder to the hand. It can take the place of an arm lost
      to a severing wound. The arm is fully functional and no different in
      appearance from a regular arm, although cyberart can be added to the arm
      at no additional cost. A cybernetic arm does not increase a user's
      Strength score. If a creature has two cybernetic arms, it can lift and
      carry double the normal maximum weight for that creature's Strength and
      size, and it gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. A character
      who wields a onehanded or light weapon with a cybernetic arm gains a +5
      bonus to CMD against disarm attempts; two cybernetic arms do not increase
      this bonus, but do allow the bonus to apply to two-handed
      weapons.</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: The changes maintained are set up
      for two arms. Adjust accordingly if only one arm is
      installed.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 25;
