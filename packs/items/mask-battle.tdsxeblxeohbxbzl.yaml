    value: >-
      <p>Made from wood, bone, or similar materials, this mask covers its
      wearer's actual appearance and identity by depicting a hateful, leering
      face instead. Because of a battle mask's excellent craftsmanship and
      exquisite details, the wearer gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks made
      to demoralize an opponent.</p>
