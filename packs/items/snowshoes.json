Snowshoes reduce the penalty for walking through heavy snow by 50%; for example, if moving through snow normally costs you 2 squares of movement per square traveled, snowshoes reduce this cost to 1.5 squares per square traveled.</p> \n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 30px;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: thin\"><a name=\"TOC-Face-Head-and-Neck\"></a>Face, Head and Neck</h3> \n"
