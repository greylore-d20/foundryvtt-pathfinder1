    value: >-
      <p>Each small tin of this specially treated jam contains just enough of
      the gooey stuff to provide a <em>halfling</em> with a single serving of
      revitalizing nourishment. While any creature can eat these preserves as a
      <em>standard action</em>, it only affects halflings in a beneficial way.
      Halflings who eat the preserves recover from <em>fatigue</em>.
      Non-halflings who eat alchemical preserves become <em>sickened</em> for 1
      round.</p>
