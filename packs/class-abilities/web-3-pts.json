      "value": "<p>An eidolon gains a pair of spinnerets, giving it the ability to spin webs. The eidolon can use these webs to support itself plus up to one creature of the same size. It can throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to 8 times per day, entangling a creature up to one size larger than the eidolon. The webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range increment. Creatures entangled by the web can escape with an Escape Artist check or a Strength check (at a â€“4 penalty). The DC of these checks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Con modifier. The webs have a Hardness of 0 and a number of hits points equal to the eidolon's total Hit Dice. The eidolon can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can pinpoint any creature touching its webs.</p>\n<p>The eidolon must possess the climb evolution to take this evolution.</p>\n<p>The summoner must be at least 7th level before selecting this evolution.</p>"
