    value: >-
      <p>Meant to shelter its flame from both water and wind, this lantern
      treats severe winds as strong winds, windstorms as severe winds, and
      hurricanes as windstorms for the purpose of determining whether they
      extinguish its flame. It holds enough air to burn underwater for 5 rounds
      before going dark.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: This is an addon to
      an existing lantern similar to shield spikes to shields.</p>
