      <p>Similar to <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>seek thoughts</i> allows you to
      sift through the surface thoughts of those around you. You may scan for
      either the answer to a simple question (such as "Where is the hidden lair
      of the wererats?") or for information on a general topic (such as the
      beliefs of an evil cult). You detect the number of creatures who are
      thinking about this question or topic within range, as well as their
      location if they are visible to you. <i>Seek thoughts</i> does not let you
      read actual surface thoughts, only if a given creature is thinking about
      the topic you are concentrating on. A successful Will save prevents you
      from sensing a creature's thoughts for the duration of the
      spell.</p><p>You can maintain concentration on <i>seek thoughts</i> while
      you engage in normal conversation, allowing you to ask leading questions
      about topics of interest. A creature conversing with you while you
      concentrate can notice that you are distracted with a successful DC 25
      Sense Motive check.</p>
