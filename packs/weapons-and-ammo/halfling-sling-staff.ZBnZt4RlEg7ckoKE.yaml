  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Made from a specially designed sling attached to a short club, a
      halfling sling staff can be used by a proficient wielder to devastating
      effect. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a
      halfling sling staff, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire,
      but not load, a halfling sling staff with one hand. Loading a halfling
      sling staff is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks
      of opportunity.</p><p>A halfling sling staff fires bullets. You can hurl
      ordinary stones with a halfling sling staff, but stones are not as dense
      or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon
      were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you
      take a -1 penalty on attack rolls.</p><p>A halfling sling staff can be
      used as a simple weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a
      club of its size. Halflings treat halfling sling staves as martial
      weapons.</p>
