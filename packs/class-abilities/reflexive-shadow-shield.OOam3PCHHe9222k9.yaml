    value: >-
      <p>Once per day as an immediate action, the rogue can gain an amount of
      cold resistance or electricity resistance equal to half the rogueâ€™s level.
      This resistance lasts for 1 round. If the rogue has the shadowy resistance
      racial trait, the cold or electricity resistance stacks with the
      resistance that trait grants; otherwise, the energy resistance does not
      stack with any cold or electricity resistance the rogue has. The rogue
      must have the resiliencyPU rogue talent before choosing this talent.</p>
