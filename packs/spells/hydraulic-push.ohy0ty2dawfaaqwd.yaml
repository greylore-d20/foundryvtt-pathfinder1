  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one
      creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush
      against any one creature or object. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal
      to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier,
      whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity. <i>Hydraulic push</i> extinguishes any normal fires on a
      creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square which it is targeted
      against. Magical fires are unaffected.</p>
