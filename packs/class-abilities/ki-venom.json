The poison lasts for 24 hours before becoming inert. The poison deals either Strength or Dexterity damage, chosen when the venom is created. The ninja can spend additional ki as part of the process of creating the ki venom to improve the venom in one or more of the following ways: spend 1 ki point to increase the damage die to a d6, spend 1 ki point to change the ability damage dealt to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage, or spend 1 ki point to increase the number of saves required to cure the poison by 1.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>Ki Venom</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;poison, injury;&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;Fortitude DC = 10 + 1/2 the ninja’s level + her Charisma modifier<br><strong>Frequency</strong>&nbsp;1/round for rounds equal to the ninja’s Charisma modifier.<br><strong>Effect</strong>&nbsp;1d4 ability damage (see above);&nbsp;<strong>Cure</strong>&nbsp;1 save</p>"
