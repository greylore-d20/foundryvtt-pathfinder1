      <h3>Description</h3><p>This ammunition is pitted with a pattern of small
      pocks into which specially formulated poison compounds can be applied. A
      poison compound is a derivative of a standard toxin that is alchemically
      reduced to a solid form. These can be made from any standard injury or
      contact poison with a successful Craft (poison) check equal to the
      poison's DC + 4. The cost of purchasing an already prepared poison
      compound for the purpose of treating pitted bullets is equal to the
      poison's base cost + 20 gp. Once crafted, the compound can be pasted into
      the ammunition's pitted design and allowed to harden. Upon completion, the
      bullet can be fired from an appropriate firearm, releasing the poison
      compound into its target upon impact, but the poison's DC is reduced by 2.
      A pitted bullet cannot be used with an alchemical cartridge. The listed
      cost does not include the cost of poison.</p>
