The wire is placed across a victim's throat and crossed behind the neck; when the handles are pulled tight, the garrote strangles him. In order for you to use a garrote, your opponent must be helpless or unaware of you. You must make a grapple check (though you avoid the -4 penalty for not having two hands free) to successfully begin garroting your opponent. Sneak attack damage does not apply to a garrote. Your garroted opponent must make a concentration check (DC 20 + your CMB + level of the spell he's casting) to cast a spell with a verbal component, use a command word item, or use any magic requiring speech. You gain the following additional option when grappling with a garrote.</p><p></p><p><em>Choke</em>: You cut off your target's air supply so he has to hold his breath (see Suffocation on page 445 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, and the Swim skill on page 108). Any round you do not maintain the choke, your opponent can take a breath and restart when he has to begin making Constitution checks.</p>"
