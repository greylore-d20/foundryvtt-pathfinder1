Any creature in the maelstrom immediately takes one-quarter your blast’s normal damage regardless of whether it succeeds at its save. A creature that succeeds at its Reflex save can choose to exit the area at the closest space.</p>\n<p>A creature in the maelstrom must succeed at a DC 35 Swim check in order to swim, and any creature that enters the maelstrom or ends its turn in the maelstrom takes half your blast’s normal damage. As a free action at the beginning of your turn, you can position each creature in the maelstrom anywhere you choose within the affected area.</p>\n<p>This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use this infusion again. You can use grappling infusion with this infusion.</p>"
