Affected creatures take additional damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level. This bonus damage is not increased by Empower Spell or similar effects. This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split between multiple missiles or rays. The damage is of the same type as the spell.</p><p>At 20th level, whenever you cast a spell on a creature made of metal or wearing medium or heavy armor, you can roll twice to penetrate the creature's spell resistance and take the better result.</p>"
