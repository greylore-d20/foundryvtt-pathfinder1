    value: >-
      <p>You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a
      <i>slow</i> spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a
      standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent
      creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing
      enough mud to end the <i>slow</i> effect is a full-round action. Jumping
      into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water
      (such as <i>create water</i> or <i>hydraulic</i> pushAPG) removes all the
      mud in 1 round.</p><p>A <i>haste</i> effect cast on a creature
      <i>slow</i>ed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the
      <i>haste</i>. <i>Slow</i> does not stack with the effects of
      <i>slow</i>ing mud. This spell cannot counter or dispel <i>haste</i>.</p>
