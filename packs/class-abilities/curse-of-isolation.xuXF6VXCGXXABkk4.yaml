    value: >-
      <p>The shaman makes an enemy within 30 feet keenly feel its status outside
      the tribe. For a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s level, the target
      gains no benefit from flanking or the aid another action, and it doesn’t
      benefit from morale bonuses. The target can attempt a Will save to negate
      this ability.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the
      target of this hex again for 24 hours. This is a curse effect.</p>
