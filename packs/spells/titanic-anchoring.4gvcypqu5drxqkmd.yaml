      <p>You become grounded and nearly immovable. You are immune to the pull
      and push special abilities, and all bull rush, grapple, overrun,
      reposition, and trip combat maneuvers made by creatures your size or
      smaller always fail. You gain a +10 bonus to your CMD against those combat
      maneuver checks made by creatures larger than you.</p>
