  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a massive <i>rampart</i> of hard-packed earth and stone 5
      feet thick. The <i>rampart</i> cannot be conjured so that it occupies the
      same space as another creature or object. Each 5-foot-wide section of the
      <i>rampart</i> has hardness 0 and 180 hit points. A section of the
      <i>rampart</i> whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries
      to break through the <i>rampart</i> with a single attack, the DC for the
      Strength check is 60. A creature can climb over the <i>rampart</i> with a
      DC 20 Climb check.</p>
