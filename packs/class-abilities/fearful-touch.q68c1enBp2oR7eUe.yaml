  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack against a
      creature, causing it to experience terrible hallucinations for 1 round.
      During this time, the creature loses any immunity to fear effects it might
      possess and takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls made against you. In
      addition, the creature takes a penalty on Will saves made against fear
      effects equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum –1). This power is a
      mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability for a number of times per
      day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Vision of Madness power of the Madness
      Domain.</p>
