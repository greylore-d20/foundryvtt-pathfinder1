    value: >-
      <p><i>Abeyance</i> suppresses the effects of a single  curse on a
      creature. It does not restore any damage or drain that might have been
      caused by the curse. <i>Abeyance</i> cannot suppress curses that cannot be
      removed by <i>remove curse</i>, but it can suppress curses such as
      lycanthropy that require <i>remove curse</i> along with additional
      measures. An individual curse can be suppressed only once by
      <i>abeyance</i>, even if cast by a different caster. <i>Abeyance</i> does
      not allow a creature to divest itself of cursed objects, though it can
      suppress a curse contracted from an object.</p>
