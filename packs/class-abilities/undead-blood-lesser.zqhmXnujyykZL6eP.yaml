  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, when the barbarian hits a creature with a charge attack,
      the creature she hit becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1/2
      her barbarian level (minimum 1). This effect does not stack with other
      fear effects to cause a stronger condition.</p><p>Blood rage powers grant
      powers in a theme, similar to how  a bloodragerâ€™s bloodline powers work. A
      barbarian cannot  select from more than one group of blood rage
      powers.</p>
