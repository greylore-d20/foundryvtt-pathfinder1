      <p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong> Acquired<br
      /><strong>Simple Template</strong> No<br /><strong>Usable with
      Summons</strong> No</p><p>In certain wilderness regions, strange
      corruptions of nature fester and grow where the boundaries between this
      world and the Abyss grow thin. Dangerous and evil fungal creatures rise to
      power in these blighted reaches, such as sinister <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fungus%20Queen">fungus
      queens</a> or legions of undead spore zombies, but when fey creatures
      become infused with this corruption and are themselves blighted, the
      resulting monstrosities are particularly vile.</p><p>The typical Abyssal
      blight manifests as a black and greasy fungal rot that sways tree branches
      and limbs where no wind propels them, and a mystic network of fell power
      extends an unnatural awareness between nearby blighted fey. Dryads are
      often the most insidious of these corrupted fey; they lure humanoids to
      literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their
      dark embrace— and further spread the disease. The dryads connect through a
      unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary
      limitations and permits them to treat all infected trees as their own
      bonded trees.</p><p>Only magic such as <em>miracle</em>, <em>limited
      wish</em>, or <em>wish</em> can sever the connection to the Abyss and cure
      a blighted fey, restoring the creature to its uncorrupted state if it
      fails to resist the transformation with a successful Will saving throw
      against the spell in question. Of course, once the blight takes hold, a
      fey creature is corrupted not only in body but in mind as well, and any
      attempts to cure such a fey creature are bound to be met with
      violence.</p><p>The process of creating a blighted fey can vary. In some
      cases, the transformation requires a new fey creature to be bound in
      blighted fungal tendrils and to languish within the corrupted region for
      24 hours, but in other cases the blight might affect a creature almost
      instantaneously. The potential to resist such corruption with a successful
      saving throw varies, as does the DC to resist such an effect. A
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.nnj51dwfkwd15ngj]{wish},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.s2p7a4biy7bl4ks2]{limited wish}, or
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.suel7sgnztenv551]{miracle} can transform
      a fey creature into a blighted fey in much the same way this magic can be
      used to rescue a blighted creature from its corruption.</p><p>Although the
      ooze creatures known as blights share a name with the planar corruption
      that creates blighted fey, these two types of creatures do not get along.
      In fact, blights often see the advance of an Abyssal incursion into their
      natural territory as much of an affront as the encroachment of mortal
      civilization, and in such cases those who oppose either group can
      sometimes find allies in the enemies of their enemy. Blights are usually
      the more difficult of the two to reach an accord with, but one should
      always tread with caution when dealing with the blighted
      fey.</p><p>“Blighted fey” is an acquired template that can be added to any
      fey creature with 2 or more Hit Dice, referred to hereafter as the base
      creature. A blighted fey uses the base creature’s statistics and abilities
      except as noted here.</p><p><strong>CR:</strong> Base creature’s CR +
      2.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic
      evil.</p><p><strong>Senses:</strong> A blighted fey gains darkvision to a
      range of 60 feet if the base creature did not already have it. If the base
      creature already has darkvision, the ability is extended by an additional
      30 feet.</p><p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor improves by
      2.</p><p><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A blighted fey gains DR
      10/cold iron and good; immunity to disease, paralysis, poison, and
      polymorph; and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10. A blighted fey
      also gains spell resistance equal to 11 + its newly adjusted
      CR.</p><p>Additionally, a blighted fey gains the following
      ability.</p><p><em>Fungal Rejuvenation (Su):</em> So long as it remains
      within 300 yards of any blighted plant of significant size (such as a
      tree) and remains standing on moist earth, the blighted fey gains fast
      healing 5. The infected tree does not need to be specifically bonded to
      the blighted fey for this ability to function.</p><p><strong>Special
      Attacks:</strong> A blighted fey gains the following special attacks.
      Unless otherwise noted, save DCs are equal to 10 + half the blighted fey’s
      Hit Dice + the blighted fey’s Constitution modifier.</p><p><em>Parasitic
      Bond (Su):</em> Once per day with a successful thorn throw attack (see
      below), the blighted fey can transform the thorns into a single burrowing,
      wriggling maggot that infests and infuses the target with a short-term
      curse from within unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. This
      parasite creates an unholy link to the target, binding it to the blighted
      fey. This binding persists for 5 rounds, during which half of any hit
      point damage taken by the blighted fey is dealt to the linked target
      instead. The type of damage remains consistent with the damage dealt to
      the blighted fey. Only one parasitic bond can be maintained with one
      creature at a time. This bond is a curse and a disease
      effect.</p><p><em>Thorn Throw (Ex):</em> A blighted fey can shoot a
      fistful of needle-sharp thorns at a single target within 20 feet as a
      standard action. The thorn attack deals an amount of damage equal to a
      sting natural attack, with damage based on the blighted fey’s size (1d4
      for a Medium fey), except the attack is resolved as a thrown ranged attack
      instead of a melee attack. Thorn throw is always a primary
      attack.</p><p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A blighted fey gains the
      following special qualities.</p><p><em>Blighted Unity (Su):</em> Blighted
      fey within 100 feet of one other can communicate through a shared fungal
      mind. This does not permit blighted fey to see and hear through each
      other’s senses, but they can share specific situational information and
      tactics through telepathy. If one blighted fey within range is aware of
      danger, they are all aware of danger and cannot be
      surprised.</p><p><em>Daughter of the Blight (Su)</em>: Fey creatures who
      normally have close ties to a specific plant gain this specific quality.
      For example, blighted fey <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dryad">dryads</a>
      are no longer dependent upon a specific tree. A dryad’s tree dependent
      special ability is modified (but not replaced) so blighted fey dryads are
      required only to remain within 300 yards of any blighted tree. This
      ability applies only to dryads and other fey who bond with plants in a
      similar manner.</p><p><em>Tainted Blood (Ex):</em> A blighted fey’s blood
      and flesh are rife with disease. Any creature that deals damage with a
      bite attack against a blighted fey, swallows one whole, or otherwise
      ingests part of one must succeed at a Fortitude save (as per Special
      Attacks above) or take 1 point of Strength damage and 1 point of Dexterity
      damage. One minute later, the affected creature must succeed at a second
      save at the same DC or be nauseated for 1 minute and take 1d6 points of
      Strength damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. This is a disease
      effect.</p><p><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str +4, Con +4, Cha
      +2.</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Blighted fey gain
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.8snLqsJN4LLL00Nq]{Toughness} as a bonus
      feat.</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> A blighted fey gains a +2 racial
      bonus on Knowledge (nature), Perception, and Stealth checks.</p>
