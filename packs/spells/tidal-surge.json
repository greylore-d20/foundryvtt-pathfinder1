    "shortDescription": "<p>If you cast <i>tidal surge</i> on land, you create an onrushing surge of water 10 feet high in a 30-foot cone that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level) and extinguishes all nonmagical fires in the area. Magical fire effects in the area of a <i>tidal surge</i> are affected as if you had cast <i>dispel magic</i>. In addition to taking damage, creatures that fail their Reflex saves are pushed 1d4x5 feet away from you, and Medium or smaller creatures are also knocked prone.</p><p>If you cast this spell in or on a body of water at least 30 feet across, you can shape the spell either as the cone described above or as a 60-foot line. In either shape, the water deals 1d10 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have in addition to pushing away creatures that fail their Reflex saves.</p>",
