  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You enchant the target so it is nearly impossible to detect by both
    magical and mundane means, granting it the following benefits. The target
    gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to half  your caster level, and can
    use Stealth to hide from all creatures attempting to perceive it, even when
    it lacks concealment or cover. It can attempt a Stealth check to avoid
    detection from creatures using blindsight, blindsense, or any ability that
    functions as either (such as lifesense or tremorsense). Furthermore, the
    target leaves no trail and cannot be tracked unless it chooses to leave a
    trail. If a creature attempts to discern the target's presence or location
    using divination magic (including magic items with a divination aura such as
    a <i>crystal</i> ball), that creature must succeed at a caster level check
    with a DC equal to the target's Stealth bonus to discern any information
    about the target, and on a failed check cannot do so for the spell's
    duration.</p>
