  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You unleash an insulting tirade so vicious and spiteful that enemies who
    hear it are physically scorched by your fury. When you cast this spell, make
    an Intimidate check to demoralize each enemy within 30 feet of you (see page
    99 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook). Enemies that are demoralized
    this way take 1d10 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save
    or catch fire. Spell resistance can negate the fire damage caused by this
    spell, but does not protect the creature from the demoralizing effect.</p>
