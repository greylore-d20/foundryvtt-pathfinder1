  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding
      territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from
      among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals,
      bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland
      creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general
      state of the natural setting.</p><p>In outdoor settings, the spell
      operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground
      settings--caves, caverns, and the like--the spell is less powerful, and
      its radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not
      function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement,
      such as in dungeons and towns.</p>
