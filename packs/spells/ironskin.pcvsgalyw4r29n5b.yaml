    value: >-
      <p>Your skin hardens and takes on the color and texture of rough iron. You
      gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your existing natural armor bonus (if you
      do not have a natural armor bonus, you are considered to have an effective
      natural armor bonus of +0). This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for
      every 4 caster levels above 4th, to a maximum of +7 at 15th level.  While
      you're under the effects of this spell, if an opponent confirms a critical
      hit or sneak attack against you with a physical weapon (not a spell or
      magical effect), you can dismiss this spell to negate the critical hit or
      sneak attack and treat it is as a normal hit. Dismissing the spell in this
      way is not an action, but you must be conscious and aware of the attack to
      do so.</p>
