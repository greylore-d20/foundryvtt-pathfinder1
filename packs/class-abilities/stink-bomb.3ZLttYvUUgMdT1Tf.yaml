    value: >-
      <p>The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb can duplicate
      the effects of @Compendium[pf1.spells.kjke96zd1j1jz48z]{Stinking Cloud}
      instead of @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud}, filling an
      area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist
      must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
