  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Sabriune has passed on the secret of swiftly manufacturing drow poison.
      Once per day, the character can create 1 or more doses of drow poison by
      spending 25 gp per dose; this process takes 30 minutes of work, regardless
      of the number of doses she creates. She can create no more than 1 dose for
      every 3 character levels she has (minimum 1 dose). Creating drow poison in
      this way does not require a skill check, but the created poison spoils if
      not used within 24 hours. (This spoilage means that selling doses of this
      poison for a profit to unsuspecting merchants might well result in
      unwanted repercussions and reprisals!)</p>
