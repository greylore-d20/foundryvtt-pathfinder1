      <p>You stealthily project your soul into the host's body as an observer,
      with limited ability to influence the target.</p><p>This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.4mw83czf7b62rar3]{possession}, except the
      host is still in full control of its body and is unaware you are
      possessing it. You can't communicate with the host directly, but you can
      cast mind-affecting spells or riding <em>possession</em> on the host as
      long as you can cast these spells as purely mental actions. Even if the
      spell you cast would normally affect more than one target or an area, it
      can affect only the host. If the host succeeds at a saving throw against a
      spell that you cast in this way, it immediately becomes aware that it is
      possessed, and if it was already aware, it receives another saving throw
      against riding <em>possession</em>. <em>Protection from Evil</em> and
      similar effects don't expel you from the host, but they do prevent you
      from casting further spells from within your host until their durations
      expire.</p>
