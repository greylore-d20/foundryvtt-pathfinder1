  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You assemble a siege engine, using up to one fewer worker per two
      caster levels you possess. You can do without one additional worker if you
      have any ranks in Knowledge (engineering), plus one additional worker per
      5 ranks you have in that skill. If your  caster level combined with
      Knowledge (engineering) fails to eliminate the need for workers, this
      spell fails.</p>
