      <p>This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque
      smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a
      <em>fog cloud</em> spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind
      dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and
      the smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute.</p><h3>Alchemical Power

      the cloud by 5 feet.</li><li><em>Obscuring Mist</em> (M): The spell
      creates a smoky haze instead of mist. This haze cannot be dispersed by
      fire spells and dissipates naturally after 1
      minute.</li><li><em>Pyrotechnics</em> (M): Increase the radius of the
      cloud by 5 feet and the duration by 2 rounds.</li></ul>
