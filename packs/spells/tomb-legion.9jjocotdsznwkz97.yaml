  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>shambler</i>, except that it calls into
      existence 1d4+2 advanced mummies rather than shambling
      mounds.</p><p>Though the spell has fallen out of favor among the Risen
      Guard because the Ruby Prince frowns on the use of undead, this spell is
      popular among followers of the Whispering Way.</p>
