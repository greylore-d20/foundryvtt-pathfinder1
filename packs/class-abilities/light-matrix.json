      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a glowing orb of swirling lights that obeys your commands. This orb illuminates the area like the&nbsp;light&nbsp;spell. The orb can be commanded to hover over your shoulder, moving with you. As a move action, you can direct it to move up to 30 feet away from you. If the light matrix is ever more than 30 feet away from you, it returns to hover over your shoulder.</p>\n<p>If you are at least 5th level, you can direct the light matrix to make a melee touch attack against one foe within 30 feet. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by a flash of light. If the attack hits, regardless of whether the target succeeds at the save, the light matrix immediately ends. The light matrix otherwise has a duration of 1 hour per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>You can’t have more than one light matrix in existence at one time. If you use this power again, any previous light matrices immediately end.</p>"
