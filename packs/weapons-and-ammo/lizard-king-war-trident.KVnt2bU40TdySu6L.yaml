  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon his 100th birthday, a lizard king's status is officially
      acknowledged, and he is honored with the presentation of a special weapon,
      the war trident, reserved exclusively for the use of his kind. These
      large, two-handed tridents are much heavier than normal (12 pounds) in
      order to take advantage of their wielders' great strength, and as a result
      they lose their range increment but deal 1d10 points of damage and have a
      x3 critical hit multiplier. In addition, extensive ritualistic practice
      with this weapon gives the lizard king the Improved Critical (war trident)
      feat as a bonus feat. A war trident is worth 20 gp, although most are
      masterwork and many are inlaid with precious metals and fetch higher
      prices.</p>
