      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This arrow is tipped with a tiny vial of tanglefoot goo. Firing a
      tangleshot arrow is a ranged touch attack; the arrow deals no damage when
      it hits, but the target is splashed with the alchemical adhesive.</p>

      <p>This effect is similar to that of a
      @Compendium[pf1.items.utncinnlwzscpzbd]{Tanglefoot Bag}, but with the
      following adjustments: <b>Reflex DC 10</b>, <b>Strength DC 12</b> to
      break, 10 points of slashing damage to cut through, concentration DC 10 to
      cast spells.</p>

      <p>A tangleshot arrow imposes a <b>-1 penalty on attack rolls</b> because
      of its weight.</p>

      <h3>Alchemical Recipe</h3>
