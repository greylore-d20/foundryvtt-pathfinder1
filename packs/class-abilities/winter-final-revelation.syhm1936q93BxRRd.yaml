    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, you become an avatar of winter and the North.
      Your body permanently transforms into living ice, as the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.qubzqiz5mqs8tbqr]{Ice Body} spell. In addition,
      your mastery of winter magic is such that any of your attacks that deal
      cold damage bypass cold immunity or cold resistance.</p>
