  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a standard
      action and touch a target to grant superficial healing. This stops any
      bleed effects the target is suffering and grants a number of temporary hit
      points equal to 1d8 + the arcanist’s Charisma modifier, lasting for a
      number of hours equal to the arcanist’s level.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, the number of hit points granted increases to 2d8 + the
      arcanist’s Charisma modifier. A creature can benefit from mending flesh
      only once per day.</p>
