  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can cause the debilitating wounds of a creature she touches
      to quickly close, helping it heal rapidly.</p><p>The target either gains
      fast healing 5 for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the witch’s class level
      or it heals up to 4 points of ability score damage from any two ability
      scores (witch’s choice).</p><p>At 15th level, in addition to the chosen
      effect, the target’s severed body members, broken bones, and ruined organs
      grow back, as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.3fbrrckyfagfzyop]{regenerate}.</p><p>Once a
      creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for
      24 hours.</p>
