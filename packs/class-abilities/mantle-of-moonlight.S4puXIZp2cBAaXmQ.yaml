  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your innate understanding of the moon renders you immune to
      lycanthropy. Additionally, you may disrupt a lycanthrope's connection to
      the moon with a successful touch attack. This action automatically forces
      the lycanthrope into its humanoid form, which it must remain in for a
      number of rounds equal to your oracle level. Upon reaching 5th level, you
      can use this ability to force others into a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.8u1xa5javcxc6szk]{rage}, as per the
      spell. Using this ability is a melee touch attack.</p><p>You can use this
      ability once per day at 5th level plus one additional time per day for
      every 5 levels above 5th.</p>
