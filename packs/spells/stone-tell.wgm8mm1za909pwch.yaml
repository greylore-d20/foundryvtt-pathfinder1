      <p>You gain the ability to speak with stones, which relate to you who or
      what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered or concealed
      behind or under them. The stones relate complete descriptions if asked. A
      stone's perspective, perception, and knowledge may prevent the stone from
      providing the details you are looking for. You can speak with natural or
      worked stone.</p>
