      "value": "<p>At 4th level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk's ki pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his <em>Wisdom</em> modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he can make a ki strike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>At 4th level</b>, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage reduction</em>.</li>\n<li><b>At 7th level</b>, his unarmed attacks are also treated as <em>cold iron</em> and <em>silver</em> for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage reduction</em>.</li>\n<li><b>At 10th level</b>, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage reduction</em>.</li>\n<li><b>At 16th level</b>, his unarmed attacks are treated as <em>adamantine</em> weapons for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage reduction</em> and bypassing <em>hardness</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By spending 1 point from his ki pool, a monk can do one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make one additional attack at his highest <em>attack bonus</em> when making a flurry of blows attack, or</li>\n<li>Increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round, or</li>\n<li>Give himself a +4 <em>dodge bonus</em> to <em>AC</em> for 1 round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these powers is activated as a <em>swift action</em>.</p>\n<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>"
