      <p>At 8th level, you gain <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Aspect%20of%20the%20Beast">Aspect
      of the Beast</a> as a bonus feat even if you donâ€™t meet the prerequisites.
      As normal for the feat, you must choose one of the manifestations, and you
      gain its benefits even while not bloodraging. When you enter a bloodrage,
      you can choose a second manifestation to affect you simultaneously for the
      duration of your bloodrage.</p>
