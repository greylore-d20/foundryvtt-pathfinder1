It sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. However, the light given off by a moonrod is particularly easily to perceive for creatures with <em>low-light vision</em>. For such creatures, a moonrod increases the light level by one step (to a maximum of normal) for a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the silver tip is burned out and worthless.</p>"
