  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you gain a natural weapon. The natural weapon lasts
      for a number of rounds equal to half your oracle level (minimum 1). You
      must choose a bite, claw, or gore attack. These attacks deal the normal
      damage for a creature of your size (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 302).</p>

      <p>At 5th level, your natural weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. This
      bonus increases by +1 at 10th, 15th, and 20th level.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, you gain two natural weapons at a time. You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
