    value: >-
      <p>The rogue revels in the thrill and adrenaline rush of a challenging
      chase. When engaged in a chase (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232) or
      pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142), the rogue gains one d20 reroll which she
      can use at any time after the original roll is made but before the results
      of the roll are revealed; she must take the second result, even if it is
      lower. She can use this reroll once per chase or once per day during a
      pursuit. Additionally, she gains Run as a bonus feat.</p>
