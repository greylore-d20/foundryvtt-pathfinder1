You gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll and take a –2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn. The movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, though activating blade rush does.</p>\n<p>If you have the kinetic whip infusion, you can manifest a kinetic whip instead of a kinetic blade at the end of your movement by increasing the burn cost of this infusion by 1.</p>\n<p>The blade or whip vanishes instantly after the rush.</p>"
