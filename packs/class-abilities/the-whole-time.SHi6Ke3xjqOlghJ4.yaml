  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Mercenaries in the employ of the Aspis Consortium often use wands of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility} to attack protected
      targets, then blend into the crowd to escape or disguise the source of the
      next attack. A character with this ability is practiced at attacking from
      magical concealment. He can use spell-trigger and spellcompletion items as
      if the following spells were on a spell list to which he has access:
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.cxgi0ub77t6aink1]{Invisibility, Greater},
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility}, and
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.c11olzqztodz5o5x]{Vanish}.</p><p>Additionally, if
      the character becomes visible as a result of a weapon or spell attack, he
      can sheathe his weapon as a free action and instantly adopt a neutral
      posture. With a successful Bluff or Disguise check (opposed by witnessesâ€™
      Sense Motive or Perception checks, whichever is higher), there is no
      obvious sign that the character is the source of the attack (though a lack
      of any other reasonable candidate can still lead observers to draw the
      correct conclusion).</p>
