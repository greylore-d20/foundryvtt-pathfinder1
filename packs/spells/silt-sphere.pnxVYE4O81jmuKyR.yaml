  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell generates an illusory silt cloud that drifts around you and
    moves with you. The cloud provides total concealment to creatures within it
    (including you) when the spell is cast. Creatures moving into the cloud
    after the spell is cast gain concealment (but not total concealment) due to
    the illusion. Any creatures within the cloud can see each other normally and
    can see out from within the cloud as though it were transparent. If a
    creature other than you that has total concealment due to the cloud makes an
    attack against any foe, it loses total concealment and gains concealment
    instead. If you make an attack against any creature, the spell ends.</p><p>A
    creature that examines the cloud from the outside and succeeds at a DC 20
    Knowledge (nature) check notices the silt cloud is unnaturally compact and
    fast moving, and that creature can attempt an immediate saving throw to
    disbelieve the illusion. Other circumstances (such as if the silt cloud
    floats in the middle of otherwise clear waters) can modify the DC of the
    Knowledge (nature) check.</p><p>This spell can be cast only underwater.</p>
