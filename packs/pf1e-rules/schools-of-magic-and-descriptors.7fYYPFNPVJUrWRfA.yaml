        <p>Abjurations are protective spells. They create physical or magical
        barriers, negate magical or physical abilities, harm trespassers, or
        even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of
        existence.</p><p>If one abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of
        another for 24 hours or more, the magical fields interfere with each
        other and create barely visible energy fluctuations. The DC to find such
        spells with the Perception skill drops by 4.</p><p>If an abjuration
        creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that
        barrier cannot be used to push away those creatures. If you force the
        barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible pressure against
        the barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.</p>

        <p>Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools.
        Conjurations transport creatures from another plane of existence to your
        plane (calling); create objects or effects on the spot (creation); heal
        (healing); bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or forms of
        energy to you (summoning); or transport creatures or objects over great
        distances (teleportation). Creatures you conjure usually—but not
        always—obey your commands.</p><p>A creature or object brought into being
        or transported to your location by a conjuration spell cannot appear
        inside another creature or object, nor can it appear f loating in an
        empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of
        supporting it.</p><p>The creature or object must appear within the
        spell's range, but it does not have to remain within the
        range.</p><h2>Calling</h2><p>A calling spell transports a creature from
        another plane to the plane you are on. The spell grants the creature the
        one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the spell
        may limit the circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who
        are called actually die when they are killed; they do not disappear and
        reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). The
        duration of a calling spell is instantaneous, which means that the
        called creature can't be dispelled.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>A creation
        spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place
        the spellcaster designates. If the spell has a duration other than
        instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and when the spell
        ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the
        spell has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is
        merely assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not
        depend on magic for its existence.</p><h2>Healing</h2><p>Certain divine
        conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to
        life.</p><h2>Summoning</h2><p>A summoning spell instantly brings a
        creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell ends or is
        dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came
        from, but a summoned object is not sent back unless the spell
        description specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes
        away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0 or lower, but it is
        not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform, during
        which time it can't be summoned again.</p><p>When the spell that
        summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all the spells it
        has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning
        abilities it may have.</p><h2>Teleportation</h2><p>A teleportation spell
        transports one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The most
        powerful of these spells can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning
        spells, the transportation is (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not
        dispellable.</p><p>Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the
        Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks
        teleportation.</p>

        <p>Divination spells enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, predict
        the future, find hidden things, and foil deceptive spells.</p><p>Many
        divination spells have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend
        in the direction you choose. The cone defines the area that you can
        sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple rounds, you
        can often gain additional information, as noted in the descriptive text
        for the spell.</p><h2>Scrying</h2><p>A scrying spell creates an
        invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted
        otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you
        possess. This level of acuity includes any spells or effects that target
        you, but not spells or effects that emanate from you. The sensor,
        however, is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours,
        and thus functions normally even if you have been blinded or deafened,
        or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.</p><p>A creature can notice
        the sensor by making a Perception check with a DC 20 + the spell level.
        The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell.</p><p>Lead
        sheeting or magical protection blocks a scrying spell, and you sense
        that the spell is blocked.</p>

        <p>Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or
        controlling their behavior. All enchantments are mind-affecting spells.
        Two subschools of enchantment spells grant you influence over a subject
        creature.</p><h2>Charm</h2><p>A charm spell changes how the subject
        views you, typically making it see you as a good
        friend.</p><h2>Compulsion</h2><p>A compulsion spell forces the subject
        to act in some manner or changes the way its mind works. Some compulsion
        spells determine the subject’s actions or the effects on the subject,
        others allow you to determine the subject’s actions when you cast the
        spell, and still others give you ongoing control over the subject.</p>

        <p>Evocation spells manipulate magical energy or tap an unseen source of
        power to produce a desired end. In effect, an evocation draws upon magic
        to create something out of nothing. Many of these spells produce
        spectacular effects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of
        damage.</p>

        <p>Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause
        people to see things that are not there, not see things that are there,
        hear phantom noises, or remember things that never
        happened.</p><p><b>Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief):</b>
        Creatures encountering an illusion usually do not receive saving throws
        to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact
        with it in some fashion.</p><p>A successful saving throw against an
        illusion reveals it to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a
        translucent outline. A failed saving throw indicates that a character
        fails to notice something is amiss.</p><p>A character faced with proof
        that an illusion isn’t real needs no saving throw. If any viewer
        successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates this fact to
        others, each such viewer gains a saving throw with a +4
        bonus.</p><h2>Figment</h2><p>A figment spell creates a false sensation.
        Those who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not their own
        slightly different versions of the figment. It is not a personalized
        mental impression. Figments cannot make something seem to be something
        else. A figment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate
        intelligible speech unless the spell description specifically says it
        can. If intelligible speech is possible, it must be in a language you
        can speak. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot speak, the
        figment produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of
        something unless you know what it looks like (or copy another sense
        exactly unless you have experienced it).</p><p>Because figments and
        glamers are unreal, they cannot produce real effects the way that other
        types of illusions can. Figments and glamers cannot cause damage to
        objects or creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or provide
        protection from the elements. Consequently, these spells are useful for
        confounding foes, but useless for attacking them directly.</p><p>A
        figment’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.</p><h2>Glamer</h2><p>A
        glamer spell changes a subject’s sensory qualities, making it look,
        feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to
        disappear. Pattern: Like a figment, a pattern spell creates an image
        that others can see, but a pattern also affects the minds of those who
        see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting
        spells.</p><h2>Phantasm</h2><p>A phantasm spell creates a mental image
        that usually only the caster and the subject (or subjects) of the spell
        can perceive. This impression is totally in the minds of the subjects.
        It is a personalized mental impression, all in their heads and not a
        fake picture or something that they actually see. Third parties viewing
        or studying the scene don’t notice the phantasm. All phantasms are
        mind-affecting spells.</p><h2>Shadow</h2><p>A shadow spell creates
        something that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such
        illusions can have real effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion is
        real.</p>

        <p>Necromancy spells manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life
        force. Spells involving undead creatures make up a large part of this
        school.</p><h2>Haunted</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Haunted Heroes
        Handbook</p><p>These spells manipulate the lingering spiritual energy
        suffusing an area or surrounding an object into semi-autonomous magical
        effects. Haunted spells function like regular spells, but those with
        ongoing durations can be neutralized as though they were haunts as they
        take effect. The statistics for each spell’s haunt-like manifestation
        are listed at the end of the spell’s other statistics.</p><p>Events
        during a haunted spell’s duration may cause its haunt-like manifestation
        to reoccur during that round, causing a surprise round if combat has not
        yet begun. These manifestations grant victims and their allies
        additional chances to notice and neutralize the haunted spell before it
        takes effect. These additional manifestations do not allow new saving
        throws to negate the spell.</p><p>Since haunted spells derive their
        power from ambient emotional energy, a given area or object can host
        only one haunted spell at a time. Most haunted spells have shapeable
        areas of effect, which can be molded to fit the areas where they are
        cast, and their effects target all creatures in the area when the
        haunted spell manifests. Once a haunted spell is cast on an area or
        object, it remains in place for 1 week or until it is activated,
        triggering its haunt-like manifestation. Once an area or object hosts a
        haunted spell, it cannot host another haunted spell for at least 7 days
        after the first one activates. A single area or object cannot host a
        haunted spell and a regular haunt at the same time. As long as a haunted
        spell remains latent in an area, its caster can’t prepare a new spell in
        that slot or regain that spell slot. When the haunted spell triggers,
        the caster can sense it but gains no insight or information about what
        triggered the haunt beyond what he can directly observe. A caster can
        dismiss a haunted spell as a swift action in order to prepare a new
        spell in that slot or to regain a spell slot; doing so causes the
        haunted spell to dissipate.</p><p>Haunted spells don’t have histories
        like regular haunts do, so effects that reveal such information merely
        expose that the haunted spell is a magical effect. Efforts to
        communicate with haunted spells using
        @UUID[Compendium.pf-content.pf-items.Item.Pxs5gtoKJFZKVpu5]{talking
        boards}, the spells
        @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.k0ihiqhfppkchs1j]{call spirit} and
        @UUID[Compendium.pf-content.pf-racial-traits.Item.CLqyc1IF6YnKONfI]{speak
        with haunt}, or similar methods automatically fail.</p>

        <p>Transmutation spells change the properties of some creature, thing,
        or condition.</p><h2>Polymorph</h2><p>A polymorph spell transforms your
        physical body to take on the shape of another creature. While these
        spells make you appear to be the creature, granting you a +10 bonus on
        Disguise skill checks, they do not grant you all of the abilities and
        powers of the creature. Each polymorph spell allows you to assume the
        form of a creature of a specific type, granting you a number of bonuses
        to your ability scores and a bonus to your natural armor. In addition,
        each polymorph spell can grant you a number of other benefits, including
        movement types, resistances, and senses. If the form you choose grants
        these benefits, or a greater ability of the same type, you gain the
        listed benefit. If the form grants a lesser ability of the same type,
        you gain the lesser ability instead. Your base speed changes to match
        that of the form you assume. If the form grants a swim or burrow speed,
        you maintain the ability to breathe if you are swimming or burrowing.
        The DC for any of these abilities equals your DC for the polymorph spell
        used to change you into that form.</p><p>In addition to these benefits,
        you gain any of the natural attacks of the base creature, including
        proficiency in those attacks. These attacks are based on your base
        attack bonus, modified by your Strength or Dexterity as appropriate, and
        use your Strength modifier for determining damage bonuses.</p><p>If a
        polymorph spell causes you to change size, apply the size modifiers
        appropriately, changing your armor class, attack bonus, Combat Maneuver
        Bonus, and Stealth skill modifiers. Your ability scores are not modified
        by this change unless noted by the spell.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted,
        polymorph spells cannot be used to change into specific individuals.
        Although many of the fine details can be controlled, your appearance is
        always that of a generic member of that creature's type. Polymorph
        spells cannot be used to assume the form of a creature with a template
        or an advanced version of a creature.</p><p>When you cast a polymorph
        spell that changes you into a creature of the animal, dragon, elemental,
        magical beast, plant, or vermin type, all of your gear melds into your
        body. Items that provide constant bonuses and do not need to be
        activated continue to function while melded in this way (with the
        exception of armor and shield bonuses, which cease to function). Items
        that require activation cannot be used while you maintain that form.
        While in such a form, you cannot cast any spells that require material
        components (unless you have the Eschew Materials or Natural Spell feat),
        and can only cast spells with somatic or verbal components if the form
        you choose has the capability to make such movements or speak, such as a
        dragon. Other polymorph spells might be subject to this restriction as
        well, if they change you into a form that is unlike your original form
        (subject to GM discretion). If your new form does not cause your
        equipment to meld into your form, the equipment resizes to match your
        new size.</p><p>While under the effects of a polymorph spell, you lose
        all extraordinary and supernatural abilities that depend on your
        original form (such as keen senses, scent, and darkvision), as well as
        any natural attacks and movement types possessed by your original form.
        You also lose any class features that depend upon form, but those that
        allow you to add features (such as sorcerers that can grow claws) still
        function. While most of these should be obvious, the GM is the final
        arbiter of what abilities depend on form and are lost when a new form is
        assumed. Your new form might restore a number of these abilities if they
        are possessed by the new form.</p><p>You can only be affected by one
        polymorph spell at a time. If a new polymorph spell is cast on you (or
        you activate a polymorph effect, such as wild shape), you can decide
        whether or not to allow it to affect you, taking the place of the old
        spell. In addition, other spells that change your size have no effect on
        you while you are under the effects of a polymorph spell.</p><p>If a
        polymorph spell is cast on a creature that is smaller than Small or
        larger than Medium, first adjust its ability scores to one of these two
        sizes using the following table before applying the bonuses granted by
        the polymorph spell.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Creature's Original
        Size</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th><th>Con</th><th>Adjusted
        Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fine</td><td>+6</td><td>-6</td><td>-</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>Diminutive</td><td>+6</td><td>-4</td><td>-</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>+4</td><td>-2</td><td>-</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>-4</td><td>+2</td><td>-2</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>-8</td><td>+4</td><td>-4</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>-12</td><td>+4</td><td>-6</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>-16</td><td>+4</td><td>-8</td><td>Medium</td></tr></tbody></table>

        <p>Almost every spell belongs to one of eight schools of magic. A school
        of magic is a group of related spells that work in similar ways. A small
        number of spells (arcane mark, limited wish, permanency,
        prestidigitation, and wish) are universal, belonging to no school.</p>

        <p>Appearing on the same line as the school and subschool, when
        applicable, is a descriptor that further categorizes the spell in some
        way. Some spells have more than one descriptor.</p><p>Most of these
        descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the
        spell interacts with other spells, with special abilities, with unusual
        creatures, with alignment, and so
        on.</p><h2>Acid</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate Magic</p><p>Acid
        effects deal damage with chemical reactions rather than cold,
        electricity, heat, or vibration. This descriptor includes both actual
        acids and their chemical opposites, called bases or alkalines (such as
        ammonia and lye).</p><h2>Air</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that create air, manipulate air, or conjure creatures
        from air-dominant planes or with the air subtype should have the air
        descriptor.</p><h2>Chaotic</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that draw upon the power of true chaos or conjure
        creatures from chaos-aligned planes or with the chaotic subtype should
        have the chaos descriptor.</p><h2>Cold</h2><p><strong>Source</strong>
        Ultimate Magic</p><p>Cold effects deal damage by making the target
        colder, typically by blasting it with supernaturally cooled matter or
        energy. Cold effects also include those that create ice, sleet, or snow
        out of nothing. They can cause frostbite, numbness, coordination
        problems, slowed movement and reactions, stupor, and
        death.</p><h2>Curse</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Curses are often permanent effects, and usually cannot be
        dispelled, but can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish,
        miracle, remove curse, or
        wish.</p><h2>Darkness</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that create darkness or reduce the amount of light
        should have the darkness descriptor. Giving a spell the darkness
        descriptor indicates whether a spell like daylight is high enough level
        to counter or dispel it.</p><h2>Death</h2><p><strong>Source</strong>
        Ultimate Magic</p><p>Spells with the death descriptor directly attack a
        creature's life force to cause immediate death, or to draw on the power
        of a dead or dying creature. The death ward spell protects against death
        effects, and some creature types are immune to death
        effects.</p><h2>Disease</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Disease effects give the target a disease, which may be an
        invading organism such as a bacteria or virus, an abnormal internal
        condition (such as a cancer or mental disorder), or a recurring magical
        effect that acts like one of the former. Creatures with resistance or
        immunity to disease apply that resistance to their saving throw and the
        effects of disease
        spells.</p><h2>Draconic</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Legacy of
        Dragons</p><p>Spells with the draconic descriptor were created by
        dragons in ages long past, and still resonate within the blood of true
        dragons to this day. Creatures of the dragon type with 5 or more racial
        hit dice can select a draconic spell as a spell known regardless of the
        class spell list it’s on. Each time such a creature gains an additional
        racial hit die, it can select a draconic spell in place of an existing
        spell known of the same or higher spell
        level.</p><h2>Earth</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that manipulate earth or conjure creatures from
        earth-dominant planes or with the earth subtype should have the earth
        descriptor.</p><h2>Electricity</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Electricity effects involve the presence and f low of
        electrical charge, whether expressed in amperes or volts. Electricity
        deals damage to creatures by disrupting their biological systems. It
        deals damage to objects (as well as creatures) by heating the material
        it passes through, and thus technically many electricity spells could
        also be treated as fire spells, but for sake of game simplicity, it is
        better to just let electricity-based spells deal electricity damage.
        Electricity effects may stun, paralyze, or even
        kill.</p><h2>Emotion</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells with this descriptor create emotions or manipulate
        the target's existing emotions. Most emotion spells are enchantments,
        except for fear spells, which are usually
        necromancy.</p><h2>Evil</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that draw upon evil powers or conjure creatures from
        evil-aligned planes or with the evil subtype should have the evil
        descriptor.</p><h2>Fear</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells with the fear descriptor create, enhance, or
        manipulate fear. Most fear spells are necromancy spells, though some are
        enchantment spells.</p><h2>Fire</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Fire effects make the target hotter by creating fire,
        directly heating the target with magic or friction. Lava, steam, and
        boiling water all deal fire damage. Fire effects can also cause
        confusion, dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, unconsciousness, and
        death. Spells that manipulate fire or conjure creatures from
        fire-dominant planes or with the fire subtype should have the fire
        descriptor.</p><h2>Force</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells with the force descriptor create or manipulate
        magical force. Force spells affect incorporeal creatures normally (as if
        they were corporeal
        creatures).</p><h2>Good</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that draw upon the power of true goodness or conjure
        creatures from good-aligned planes or with the good subtype should have
        the good
        descriptor.</p><h2>Language-Dependent</h2><p><strong>Source</strong>
        Ultimate Magic</p><p>A language-dependent spell uses intelligible
        language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot understand
        or hear what the caster of a language-dependent spell says, the spell
        has no effect, even if the target fails its saving
        throw.</p><h2>Lawful</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that draw upon the power of true law or conjure
        creatures from law-aligned planes or with the lawful subtype should have
        the law descriptor.</p><h2>Light</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that create significant amounts of light or attack
        darkness effects should have the light descriptor. Giving a spell the
        light descriptor indicates whether a spell like darkness is high enough
        level counter or dispel
        it.</p><h2>Meditative</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Divine
        Anthology</p><p>Meditative spells are not cast like other spells—they
        are cast during the period of the day when a spellcaster prepares her
        spells. A meditative spell must already be prepared at the time when you
        start your 1-hour spell preparation ritual, and at the end of that time,
        the meditative spell of your choosing is cast, leaving you with that one
        spell slot used for the remainder of the day. You can have only one
        meditative spell in effect on you at any one time. All meditative spells
        have a range of personal and a target of you, and they can't be brewed
        into potions or part of similar one-use items like elixirs. A meditative
        spell can be placed on a scroll or in a wand, but the act of casting the
        spell must always be incorporated into the user's spell-preparation
        time; it also takes 1 hour for a character who succeeds at an
        appropriate Use Magic Device check to operate such an item. Though some
        of these spells are on the cleric spell list, they can't be part of an
        oracle's list of spells known. Spontaneous casters such as oracles or
        sorcerers cannot benefit from the effects of a meditative spell, nor can
        characters who use such magic without preparation via Use Magic Device
        and a magic item, since part of the process of casting and maintaining
        the effects of a meditative spell involves tying the act of weaving the
        magic into the very process of meditation and study that a prepared
        spellcaster (such as a cleric or wizard) undergoes at the start of every
        day.</p><h2>Mind-Affecting</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Mindless creatures (those with an Intelligence score of “—”)
        and undead are immune to mind-affecting
        effects.</p><h2>Pain</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Pain effects cause unpleasant sensations without any
        permanent physical damage (though a sensitive target may suffer mental
        repercussions from lengthy exposure to pain). Creatures that are immune
        to effects that require a Fort save (such as constructs and undead) are
        immune to pain effects.</p><h2>Poison</h2><p><strong>Source</strong>
        Ultimate Magic</p><p>Poison effects use poison, venom, drugs, or similar
        toxic substances to disrupt and damage living creatures through chemical
        reactions. Technically, acids and poisons are both chemical reactions,
        but for the purpose of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, they are
        categorized as different effects, with acids dealing hit point damage
        and poisons causing ability damage, ability drain, bleeding, confusion,
        convulsions, nausea, paralysis, reduced healing, suffocation,
        unconsciousness, or death. Creatures with resistance to poison (such as
        dwarves) apply that resistance to their saving throws and the effects of
        poison spells. Creatures with immunity are immune to poisonous aspects
        of poison spells, but not necessarily all effects of the spell (for
        example, a spell that creates a pit full of liquid poison could still
        trap or drown a poison-immune
        creature).</p><h2>Ruse</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Intrigue</p><p>Spells with the ruse descriptor are easily mistaken for
        other spells and are intended to confuse even onlookers trained in
        Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana). Attempts to identify a ruse spell by
        its effects, its aura, its components, or other attributes with a skill
        check treat the spell as though it were a different spell, as indicated
        in the spell's description. The one attempting the check can correctly
        identify the spell only by exceeding the DC by 10. The false spell is
        typically a level lower than the ruse spell, so skill checks use the DC
        for the lower-level spell. Even detect magic and most similar spells
        don't prevent the caster from being fooled by a ruse spell. Analyze
        dweomer, greater arcane sight, and similar spells of the same or higher
        spell level that automatically identify spells reveal a ruse spell for
        what it is. Ruse spells that mimic harmless spells still list harmless
        on their saving throw or spell resistance lines; a creature that knows
        or suspects the true nature of the spell typically chooses to attempt
        the save.</p><h2>Shadow</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Shadow spells manipulate matter or energy from the Shadow
        Plane, or allow transport to or from that
        plane.</p><h2>Sonic</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Sonic effects transmit energy to the target through frequent
        oscillations of pressure through the air, water, or ground. Sounds that
        are too high or too low for the humanoid ear to detect can still
        transmit enough energy to cause harm, which means that these effects can
        even affect deafened creatures. Sound effects can cause hit point
        damage, deafness, dizziness, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, and
        temporary blindness, and can detect creatures using batlike
        echolocation.</p><h2>Water</h2><p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate
        Magic</p><p>Spells that manipulate water or conjure creatures from
        water-dominant planes or with the water subtype should have the water
        descriptor.</p>
