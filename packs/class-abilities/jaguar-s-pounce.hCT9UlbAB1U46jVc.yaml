    value: >-
      <p>When a slayer with this talent deals sneak attack damage, he can
      attempt a disarm or trip combat maneuver as an immediate action as if the
      target were flat-footed (losing its Dexterity bonus to CMD). This combat
      maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>The slayer must have the jaguarâ€™s grace talent to select this
      talent.</p>
