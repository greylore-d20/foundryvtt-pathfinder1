      "value": "<p>When a rogue with this talent uses the @Compendium[pf1.spells.oj36nfak6jc2s5ky]{Disguise Self} spell-like ability, she can also alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.tr7m97npkbgm4wp7]{Detect Evil}) for the duration of the disguise self effect. She can choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. The rogue must have disguise self as a spell-like ability before choosing this talent.</p>"
