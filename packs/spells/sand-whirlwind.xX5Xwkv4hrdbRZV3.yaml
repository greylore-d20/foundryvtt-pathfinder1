  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A whirling cloud of sand strikes the target, blinding it and hampering
      its ability to speak. To speak while affected by the spell, the target
      must make a Concentration check (DC equal to the DC of this spell). If the
      target tries to cast a spell, the Concentration DC increases by the level
      of the spell being cast. A successful Will save negates the blindness but
      not the speechhampering effect.</p>
