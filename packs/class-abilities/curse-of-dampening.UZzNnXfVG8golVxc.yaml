  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You diminish one target within 30 feet as a standard action, making its
      attacks weaker. Whenever the target would roll to deal damage with an
      attack or spell, it deals the minimum amount of damage. This curse lasts
      for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will
      saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse
      effect.</p>

      <p>You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at
      11th level and 15th level. You must be at least 7th level before selecting
      this revelation.</p>
