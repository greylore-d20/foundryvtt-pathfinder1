      "value": "<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2><ul><li><b>Ability Score Modifiers:</b> Reptoids are both manipulative and strong, but they're deliberate in their movements. They gain +2 <em>Strength</em> and +2 <em>Charisma</em> but suffer –2 <em>Dexterity</em>.</li><li><b>Size:</b> Reptoids are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li><li><b>Speed:</b> Reptoids have a base speed of 30 feet.</li><li><b>Languages:</b> All reptoids begin play speaking Common and Reptoid. Reptoids with high <em>Intelligence</em> scores can choose any languages they want (except for secret languages, such as Druidic).</li></ul><h3>Defensive Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><b>Scales</b>: When in its natural form, a reptoid has a +1 <em>natural armor bonus</em>.</li><li><b>Cold-Blooded (Ex)</b>: Reptoids receive a +2 racial saving throw bonus against <em>mind-affecting</em> effects and <em>poison</em>.</li></ul><h3>Offensive Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><b>Natural Weapons (Ex):</b> When in its natural form, a reptoid has a bite attack and two claw attacks that deal 1d3 points of damage each.</li></ul><h3>Senses Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> Reptoids can see twice as far as humans in dim light.</li></ul><h3>Other Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><b>Change Shape (Su)</b> A reptoid can assume the appearance of a specific single Medium <em>humanoid</em>. The reptoid always takes this specific form when it uses this ability. The reptoid gains a +10 <em>racial bonus</em> on <em>Disguise</em> checks to appear as that type of <em>humanoid</em>. This ability otherwise functions as <em>alter self</em>, except the reptoid does not adjust its ability scores. A reptoid can select a new humanoid form by spending 1 week preparing itself for the change, but can then no longer assume its previous humanoid form.</li><li><b>Mental Potency (Ex)</b> A reptoid's mental effects can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal. Both the <em>Hit Die</em> limit and the total number of <em>Hit Dice</em> affected by each <em>enchantment</em> or <em>illusion</em> spell it casts increase by 1. For <em>enchantment</em> and <em>illusion</em> spells it casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). This ability stacks with the <em>mesmerist's</em> ability of the same name.</li></ul>"
