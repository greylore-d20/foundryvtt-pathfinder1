      <p>You suppress magical sound-dampening effects within the
      area.</p><p><em>Disrupt silence</em> temporarily negates magical
      <em>silence</em> within its area, so that normal sounds can be heard
      within the overlapping areas of effect. Additionally, <em>disrupt
      silence</em> can automatically counter or dispel any magical
      <em>silence</em> effect of equal or lower level cast upon the same target,
      such as <em>silence</em>. If you cast <em>disrupt silence</em> on the
      target of a higher-level <em>silence</em> effect, it functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{dispel magic} instead
      of its normal function.</p>
