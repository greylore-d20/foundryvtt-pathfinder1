  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You whisk yourself and willing allies out of a tight jam, or instantly
      transfer yourselves to another location to achieve greater strategic
      positioning. You can move any allies within range to any other space of
      your choosing within range. Those spaces need not be in line of sight or
      line of effect from your original position, but must be open locations on
      surfaces able to support the creatures teleported. Except as noted above,
      this spell otherwise functions as <i>dimension door</i>.</p>
