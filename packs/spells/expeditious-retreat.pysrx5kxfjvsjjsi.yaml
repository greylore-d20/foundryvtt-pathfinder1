  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. This adjustment
      is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of
      movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that
      increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the
      Acrobatics skill).</p>
