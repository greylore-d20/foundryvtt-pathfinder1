    value: >-
      <p>You unleash a blast of holy flames that washes over all creatures in
      the area in a glorious display of divine power. This deals damage to evil
      creatures and heals good creatures in the area. The amount of damage dealt
      and the number of hit points restored in each case is 1d8 points per 2
      caster levels (maximum 5d8).  Half of the damage this spell deals to evil
      creatures is fire damage, and half of the damage is pure divine power that
      is therefore not subject to reduction by energy resistance to fire-based
      attacks.  Neutral enemies within the spell's area of effect also take the
      fire damage, but do not take the divine damage. Neutral allies within the
      area are healed by half as much as good creatures. A successful Reflex
      saving throw halves the damage taken in all cases.</p>
