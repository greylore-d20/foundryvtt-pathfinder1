      launcher contains its entire load of rockets and energy charges. It cannot
      be reloaded, and once its final rocket is fired, the weapon is useless.
      Rockets fired from a rocket launcher can target a single target or a grid
      intersection. A creature that takes a direct hit from a rocket cannot
      attempt a saving throw to reduce the damage taken. When a rocket strikes
      its target, it explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals fire and
      bludgeoning damage to all creatures within that area of effect-a
      successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the damage for all but the target.
      Some rocket launchers carry alternate loads, replacing the fire damage
      with electricity or cold damage, and there are rumors of rocket launchers
      capable of doing even more damage, firing gravity-based weapons or using
      radioactive payloads.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC
