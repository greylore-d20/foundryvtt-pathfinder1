      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      head</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> 10; <strong>Usage</strong> 1
      charge/hour</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This open-faced, blue polymer helmet
      includes a nylon strap and adjustable tinted visor capable of hiding all
      but the wearer's mouth and chin. The interior of the tinted faceplate
      provides a heads-up display when activated, with each charge providing
      enough power to function for 1 hour of continuous use. During this time,
      the helmet's external motion sensors pick up on sudden movements and
      subtle visual cues, granting the wearer a +5 competence bonus on
      Perception checks to notice moving targets within 60 feet. A secondary
      setting on the helmet adds an audible alarm that creates a loud chirping
      sound near the wearer's ear whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature
      approaches within 60 feet. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each
      interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing
      wall. This noise is loud enough to waken the wearer from sleep, but not
      loud enough to awaken nearby
      sleepers.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 20;
