    value: >-
      <p>You alter an instrument so it sounds like a different kind of
      instrument you are familiar with. The change could be minor (such as
      making a lute sound like a guitar) or major (making a keyboard sound like
      drums). All other aspects of the instrument-such as volume, pitch, and how
      it is played- are unchanged. For example, a piccolo made to sound like an
      organ is no louder than a normal piccolo, can produce only high notes in
      the piccolo range, and is a wind instrument.</p>
