  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You <i>teleport</i> up to one ally per five caster levels to your
    location.</p><p>You determine which allies you want to <i>teleport</i> at
    the time of casting; these allies have 1 round to decide to allow or refuse
    your spell, and they <i>teleport</i> immediately upon accepting. Allies are
    <i>teleport</i>ed as if you had cast <i>teleport</i> on them (your current
    location is at least "studied carefully" for this purpose), appearing in a
    puff of brimstone in a space adjacent to you. If you are in combat and your
    allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon arrival but are not
    considered flat-footed even though they have not taken any actions. The
    spell does not function in areas warded against intrusion by evil creatures
    (such as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect).</p>
