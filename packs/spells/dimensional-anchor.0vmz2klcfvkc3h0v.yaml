  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack
    to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with
    a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel.
    Forms of movement barred by a <i>dimensional anchor</i> include <i>astral
    projection</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>ethereal jaunt</i>,
    <i>etherealness</i>, <i>gate</i>, <i>maze</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>shadow
    walk</i>, <i>teleport</i>, and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also
    prevents the use of a <i>gate</i> or <i>teleportation circle</i> for the
    duration of the spell.</p><p>A <i>dimensional anchor</i> does not interfere
    with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the
    spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack
    forms. Also, <i>dimensional anchor</i> does not prevent summoned creatures
    from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.</p>
