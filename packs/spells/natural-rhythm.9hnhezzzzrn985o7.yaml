    value: >-
      <p>You enhance a creature's ability to harm an opponent based on the
      number of times it has already injured that opponent with a natural
      attack. Each time the creature successfully strikes an opponent with a
      natural attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 bonus on damage rolls
      made against that opponent when making natural attacks (maximum +5 bonus).
      If an attack misses, the bonus to damage for all attacks resets to +0.</p>
