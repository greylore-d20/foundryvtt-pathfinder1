  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, the shaman assumes a spirit-infused paragon form
      that makes her a lethal stalker of the alleys and shadows. She gains the
      ability to make sneak attacks as a rogue of her shaman level for 1 minute
      or until dismissed.</p>

      <p>She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her
      Charisma modifier.</p>
