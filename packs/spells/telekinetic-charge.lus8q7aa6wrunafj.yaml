  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You telekinetically launch an ally across the battlefield to anywhere
      within this spell's range. While moving, your ally is flying just above
      the ground unless you wish otherwise. Movement from this spell provokes
      attacks of opportunity as normal, although you can lift your ally over
      objects or out of enemy reach, as long as your ally remains within this
      spell's range. If your ally lands adjacent to an opponent, he can spend an
      immediate action to make a melee attack against that opponent with a +2
      bonus on the attack roll.</p>
