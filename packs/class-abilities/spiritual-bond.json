      "value": "<p>At 14th level, a spiritualist’s life force becomes intrinsically linked with the phantom’s spiritual essence. As long as the phantom has 1 or more hit points, when the spiritualist takes damage that would reduce her to fewer than 0 hit points, those points of damage are transferred to the phantom instead. This transfer stops after the phantom takes all the points of damage or the phantom is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to its Constitution score. In the latter case, points of damage dealt in excess of this limit are dealt to the spiritualist.</p>\n<p>This ability affects only effects that deal hit point damage.</p>"
