  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are surrounded by a nimbus of shadow shaped like your god's unholy
      symbol or a symbol of your faith. Any good creature striking you with
      unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal
      damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1
      point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons
      with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell
      resistance applies against this damage. You also take half damage from
      magical attacks with the good descriptor. If such an attack allows a
      Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving
      throw.</p>
