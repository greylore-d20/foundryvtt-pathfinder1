      "value": "<p>You can walk across lava, magma, and similarly heated stone at your normal movement speed. You are immune to any fire damage caused by the surface while you walk above it, even if it radiates damage at a distance. While using lava walk, you never slip or fall from poor or slippery footing. You can use lava walk for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration doesnâ€™t need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>"
