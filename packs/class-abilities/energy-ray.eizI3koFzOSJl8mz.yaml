  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can
      expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash a ray of pure energy as a ranged
      touch attack. This ray has a range of 30 feet. The ray deals an amount of
      energy damage equal to 1d6 points + 1d6 points for every 2 occultist
      levels you possess beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd level, 3d6 at 5th, and so on, to
      a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level).</p>

      <p>When you unleash an energy ray, you must decide what type of damage it
      deals (acid, cold, electricity, or fire).</p>
