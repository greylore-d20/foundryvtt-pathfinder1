      <p>You unleash the basest instincts of iniquity in the target and cause
      them to become his overriding reason for being. The target neither gains
      nor provides benefit from teamwork feats or the aid another action and
      can't willingly accept harmless magical effects from others.  The target
      moves by Stealth whenever possible, and lies and deceives others
      instinctively to further its personal agenda. In addition, when the target
      is conscious, it must succeed at a Will save against the spell's save DC
      each hour (or each round during combat or a similarly stressful situation)
      or behave as if affected by a <i>crime wave</i> spell for 1 round. <i>Life
      of Crime</i> is particularly difficult to remove. Only a <i>remove
      curse</i> with a higher caster level than <i>life of crime's</i> caster
      level, or a <i>limited wish</i>, <i>wish</i>, or <i>miracle</i> can remove
      its effects.</p>
