  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This functions as <i>mental barrier <i>II</i>I</i>, but if you are struck
    by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the additional
    damage is negated (as <i>moderate</i> fortification). This does not stack
    with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit
    or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to <i>mind thrust I</i>,
    <i>II</i>, and <i>II</i>I, and you take half damage from <i>mind thrust
    I</i><i>V</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>V</i>I (reduced to one-quarter on a
    successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.</p>
