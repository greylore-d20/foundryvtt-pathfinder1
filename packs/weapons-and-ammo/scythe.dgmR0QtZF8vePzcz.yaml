  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon consists of a long wooden shaft with protruding handles and
      a sharp curved blade set at a right angle. Derived from a farm tool used
      to mow down crops, a scythe requires two hands to use, and is unwieldy but
      capable of inflicting grievous wounds. Its connotations as a symbol of
      death due to its association with reaping also make the scythe a
      particularly intimidating weapon.</p>
