      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.08a7k67ixq5htlpb]{ancestral regression},
      except as noted above and as follows. The wayang loses her darkvision
      racial trait and gains the low-light vision racial trait in its place. The
      alignment and personality of the wayang are not affected by the
      transformation, but the spell conceals her alignment as per
      <em>undetectable alignment</em>. Unlike <em>ancestral</em> regression,
      this spell grants the target a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as a
      gnome; even though the wayang appears as a gnomish analog of herself, the
      differences between gnomes and wayangs are great enough that she cannot be
      mistaken for a gnome by other wayangs who know her.</p>
