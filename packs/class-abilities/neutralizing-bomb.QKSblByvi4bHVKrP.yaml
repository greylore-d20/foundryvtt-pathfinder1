  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to give it the
      potential to end certain ongoing effects instead of dealing damage. Each
      creature in the splash radius can attempt a new saving throw against any
      poison afflicting it and any ongoing conditions or ongoing acid, cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic damage. (If an effect did not allow a saving
      throw, this bomb doesn’t allow affected creatures to attempt one.) Success
      counts as one successful save toward ending poison and immediately ends
      other conditions. Exposed poison in the splash radius is also rendered
      harmless. A creature with poison abilities that is directly struck by the
      bomb finds those abilities useless for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a
      Fortitude saving throw.</p>

      <p>This discovery doesn’t stack with any other that modifies bombs.</p>
