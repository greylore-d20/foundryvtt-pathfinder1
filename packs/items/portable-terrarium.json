Tiny air holes in the lid allow living creatures inside the portable terrarium to breathe, and the interior can be outfitted with a variety of substrates and other materials the creatures might require. A portable terrarium is usually fitted with straps so it can be tied to a pack.</p>\r\n<p>Diminutive and smaller creatures, such as some familiars, can be safely carried within a portable terrarium and have total <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover\">cover</a> while inside it. Healers and botanists often store living plants in these containers; a successful DC 12 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a> (nature) check is required to transplant a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant\">plant</a> into a portable terrarium, and most plants can live in a portable terrarium indefinitely so long as they are properly tended.</p>\r\n\r\n"
