  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist is familiar enough with the ties between his body and
      spirit that he lingers at death’s door far longer than a normal person. He
      treats his Constitution as 10 points higher than normal for the purpose of
      determining when hit point damage kills him (so an alchemist with a
      Constitution of 10 and this discovery dies at –20 hit points instead of
      –10). Reducing him to 0 Constitution or its equivalent (from ability
      damage, ability drain, Constitution penalties, and so on) makes him
      unconscious and comatose, but he is only killed after taking an additional
      5 points of Constitution damage, drain, or penalty (in effect, the
      alchemist must be brought to –5 Constitution in order to be killed by
      these attacks).</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
