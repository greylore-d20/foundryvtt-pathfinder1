  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 18th level, a medium’s soul is spacious enough to provide a foothold
      for his fallen allies, if he so chooses. If one of the allies who
      participated in the medium’s seance that day dies within line of effect
      and line of sight of the medium, the medium can spend an immediate action
      to accept that ally’s spirit within him. Since the ally inhabits the
      portion of the medium’s soul normally reserved for a spirit, this
      suppresses the medium’s spirit, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities
      as long as the medium maintains this ability.</p>

      <p>The ally’s spirit and the medium share the medium’s body and can decide
      each round on the medium’s turn which of them will take the medium’s
      actions for that round. If they don’t agree on who should act, they
      attempt opposed Charisma checks to determine who is dominant for the next
      hour, and the dominant character decides who acts on each round.</p>

      <p>The ally’s spirit has all the spells and limited use abilities (such as
      uses of channel energy, ki, and panache) that it possessed at the time of
      death, but it is incapable of regaining any abilities, points, spells, or
      uses of abilities it expends. When the ally’s spirit acts, it uses the
      ally’s base attack bonus, caster level, and special abilities (such as
      weapon proficiency), but uses the medium’s physical ability scores. If the
      ally returns to life, this ability immediately ends. Otherwise, the medium
      can maintain this ability indefinitely.</p>

      <p>The medium can end this effect as a standard action, though if the ally
      is unwilling to depart, the medium must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC
      = 10 + 1/2 the ally’s hit dice + the ally’s Charisma modifier) or the
      attempt fails and the ally becomes dominant for 24 hours.</p>
