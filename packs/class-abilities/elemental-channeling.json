      "value": "<p>You can heal and harm elemental beings. You gain @Compendium[pf1.feats.f5rgOsdDlseGr4o5]{Elemental Channel} (your choice of air, earth, fire, or water) as a bonus feat. You gain the cleric’s channel energy ability, as a cleric of your oracle level, but only to use @Compendium[pf1.feats.f5rgOsdDlseGr4o5]{Elemental Channel}. The DC for this effect is 10 + half your oracle level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>At 5th, 10th, and 15th level, you gain @Compendium[pf1.feats.f5rgOsdDlseGr4o5]{Elemental Channel} with one of the remaining elemental subtypes as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p>You can take other feats to add to this ability, such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.1HfwfBOSWtdxFQ2s]{Improved Channel}, but not feats that alter this ability, such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.ieww7CP6JK5pwtpg]{Alignment Channel}. This revelation’s effects do not stack with levels in other classes that grant the channel energy ability.</p>"
