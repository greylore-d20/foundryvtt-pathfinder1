      <p>You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written
      work.</p><p>The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words
      long.</p><p>When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the <i>sepia
      snake sigil</i> springs into being, transforming into a large sepia
      serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of between the
      symbol and the reader.</p><p>Simply seeing the enspelled text is not
      sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it.
      The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it
      succeeds, the <i>sepia snake</i> dissipates in a flash of brown light
      accompanied by a puff of duncolored smoke and a loud noise. If the target
      fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and
      immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1
      day per caster level have elapsed.</p><p>While trapped in the amber field
      of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain
      spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its
      surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even
      killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury.
      However, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until
      the spell ends.</p><p>The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal
      observation, and <i>detect magic</i> reveals only that the entire text is
      magical.</p><p>A <i>dispel magic</i> can remove the sigil. An <i>erase</i>
      spell destroys the entire page of text.</p><p><i>Sepia snake sigil</i> can
      be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as
      secret page.</p>
