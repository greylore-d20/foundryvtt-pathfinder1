  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The rogue can call upon the mystical legacies of the Council. Once per
      day, she can choose a skill in which she has no ranks. After she spends 10
      minutes communing with these mystical spirits, they grant her a luck bonus
      equal to her rogue level with that skill, and she can attempt checks with
      that skill as if she were trained in its use. The effects of founderâ€™s
      blessing last for 8 hours.</p>
