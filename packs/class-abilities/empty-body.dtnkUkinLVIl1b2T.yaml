  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for
      1 minute as though using the spell
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.gw9bes9othfqm7mi]{Etherealness}. Using this ability
      is a <em>move action</em> that consumes 3 points from his ki pool. This
      ability only affects the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures
      ethereal.</p>
