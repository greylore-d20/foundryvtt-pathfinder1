  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, the ronin is the master of his own destiny. Whenever the
      ronin makes a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, he may
      roll twice and take the better result. In addition, once per day, the
      ronin can treat any one d20 roll as if the result were a natural 20. He
      must declare the use of this ability before the roll is made.</p>
