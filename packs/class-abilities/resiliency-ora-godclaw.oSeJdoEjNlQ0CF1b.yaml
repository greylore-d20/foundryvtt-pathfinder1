    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, when you are brought below 0 hit points but not killed,
      you can act is if you are disabled for 1 round. At the end of your next
      turn, unless you are brought to above 0 hit points, you immediately fall
      unconscious and begin dying.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, you gain @Compendium[pf1.feats.O0e0UCim27GPKFuW]{Diehard}
      as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisite.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, three times per day, if you are disabled and take a
      standard action (or any otherwise strenuous action), you avoid taking 1
      point of damage if you succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw.</p>
