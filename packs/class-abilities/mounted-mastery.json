      "value": "<p>At 8th level, the cavalier ignores the armor check penalty when using the Ride skill, regardless of whether or not the creature he is riding is his mount. Whenever he makes a charge attack while mounted, he receives a +4 dodge bonus to his AC to avoid attacks set against his charge. When making such an attack, he can add his mount's Strength modifier to the damage roll, in addition to his own. He also receives a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: @Compendium[pf1.feats.0spsP9ylE3goD3jc]{Mounted Combat}, @Compendium[pf1.feats.liPAO5urMI9chctT]{Ride-By Attack}, @Compendium[pf1.feats.7zJTztNW7hdaqjKc]{Skill Focus}<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Skill%20Focus\">&nbsp;(Ride)</a>, @Compendium[pf1.feats.jKVhOxHu6VmUgFdp]{Spirited Charge}, @Compendium[pf1.feats.8mS9B8Uc8odklIpl]{Trample}, or @Compendium[pf1.feats.4fAgch4ut1JYPBbL]{Unseat}. He must qualify for the feat selected.</p>"
