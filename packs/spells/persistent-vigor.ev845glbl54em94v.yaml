  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are filled with a persistent vigor. You gain fast healing 2 and are
      immune to bleed effects as well as the sickened and nauseated conditions.
      When you succeed at a saving throw against a disease or poison effect,
      that disease or poison effect ends (as if you had succeeded at enough
      saving throws to cure that effect).</p><p>If you fail a saving throw
      against a disease or poison effect, you can instantly dismiss this spell
      to reroll that saving throw with a +4 bonus; you must take the result of
      this reroll, even if it is lower.</p>
