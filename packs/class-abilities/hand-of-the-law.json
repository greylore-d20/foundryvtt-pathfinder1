      "value": "<p>At 15th level, the cavalier can declare himself an enforcer of martial law as a swift action. For a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier, the cavalier can ignore difficult terrain and gains an additional +2 bonus on attack rolls while charging. Any creatures the cavalier demoralizes while this ability is in effect are shaken for a number of additional rounds equal to the cavalier’s Charisma modifier. Additionally, when these creatures attack the cavalier, attempt saving throws against the cavalier’s abilities, or attempt opposed skill checks against the cavalier, they take a –3 penalty for being shaken (instead of –2). A cavalier can use this ability only once per combat.</p>"
