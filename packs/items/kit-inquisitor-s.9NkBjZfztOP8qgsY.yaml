            the <em>Escape Artist</em> skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for
            masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a
            <em>Strength</em> check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles).
            Manacles have <em>hardness</em> 10 and 10 <em>hit

            lock you want to the cost of the manacles.</p><p>For the same cost,
            you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature,
            manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge
            creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal,

            size. A creature in fetters is entangled and can move at only half
            speed. In addition, a fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15
            <em>Acrobatics</em> check to move more than its (reduced) speed in a
            round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls
            prone.</p><p><strong>Frontal Restraint</strong>: A creature whose
            wrists are bound with manacles can wield only one melee weapon or
            shield in combat (the weapon may be a two-handed weapon). It cannot
            make use of ranged weapons, except for crossbows (but even these
            cannot be reloaded by the bound creature). Any attack the creature
            makes while manacled takes a -4 penalty. The creature can attempt
            skill checks using its hands, but at a -5 penalty (-15 on Disable
            Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is
            wearing).</p><p><strong>Rear Restraint</strong>: Manacles might be
            employed to keep a creature's hands behind its back. In such cases,
            the creature cannot use its hands to effectively employ any weapon
            or shield. The creature can attempt to use its hands to perform a
            skill, but at a -10 penalty (-25 on Disable Device checks to pick
            the lock of manacles the creature is wearing). While manacled, a
            creature can attempt to flip its arms beneath its legs, bringing its
            hands in front of itself. This requires a successful DC 25 Escape
            Artist check (a separate Escape Artist check is then required to
            escape the manacles).</p><p><strong>Restraining Two
            Individuals</strong>: Two creatures might share one set of manacles.
            While manacled together, the manacled individuals must remain
            adjacent to one another. If they are not working together, they are
            both treated as grappled. If they are working together, they can
            move together in the same round (using the movement speed of the
            slower creature). A manacled creature can forfeit its turn during
            combat to mimic the other manacled creature's movements, allowing
            that creature to act as if unrestrained.</p>
