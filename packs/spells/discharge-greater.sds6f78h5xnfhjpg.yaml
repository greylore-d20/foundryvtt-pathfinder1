  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.cnn3hvm9e4bub6pr]{discharge}, except it can discharge
    multiple technological objects and can be used to target an area.</p>

    <p>You choose to use greater <em>discharge</em> in one of two ways: an area
    <em>discharge</em> or a targeted <em>discharge</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Area</em> <em><b>Discharge</b></em>: When greater <em>discharge</em>
    is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius
    burst.</p>

    <p>Each creature in the area is affected as though by <em>discharge</em>
    (affecting only one object in the creature's possession), and each
    unattended object is similarly affected.</p>

    <p><em>Targeted</em> <em><b>Discharge</b></em>: This spell functions as
    <em>discharge</em>, but if the target is a creature, it can
    <em>discharge</em> one randomly determined object from the target's charged
    or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you
    possess.</p>
