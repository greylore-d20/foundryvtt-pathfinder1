    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, when you or an ally within 30 feet rolls a natural 1 or a
      natural 20 on an attack roll, an ability check, a skill check, or a saving
      throw, as an immediate action you can grant all allies within 30 feet
      special insights that help them overcome similar challenges. Once during
      the next minute, each affected creature can choose to roll twice and take
      the better result before attempting an attack roll, ability check, skill
      check, or saving throw. You can use this ability once per day at 8th
      level, and one additional time per day for every 4 cleric levels beyond
      8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Unity power of the Community Domain or the
      Remote Viewing power of the Knowledge Domain.</p>
