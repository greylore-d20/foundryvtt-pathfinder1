      <p>A formula book has 100 pages of parchment, and each alchemical extract
      formula takes up one page per extract level. A newly purchased formula
      book contains no extract formulas. An alchemist character begins play with
      a formula book containing the extract formulae he knows (Advanced Player's
      Guide 32). This is the alchemist equivalent of a spellbook for wizards (a
      spellbook and a formula book are essentially the same item).</p>
