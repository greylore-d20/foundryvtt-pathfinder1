You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your existing natural armor bonus. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase this enhancement bonus by 1. For every 3 levels beyond 2nd, you can accept 1 additional point of burn to further increase this enhancement bonus by 1 (to a maximum of +7 at 17th level).</p>\n<p>Whenever you accept burn while using a wood wild talent, phytokinetic power causes your full natural armor bonus to apply to your touch AC for 1 round. You can dismiss and restore this effect as an immediate action.</p>"
