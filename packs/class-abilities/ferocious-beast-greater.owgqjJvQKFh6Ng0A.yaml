    value: >-
      <p>While the barbarian is raging, her animal companion shares the benefits
      of the barbarianâ€™s rage powers that are constant in effect. It gains no
      benefit from rage powers that require actions to activate, even if they
      are free actions.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the ferocious beast rage power and be at least
      8th level to select this rage power.</p>
