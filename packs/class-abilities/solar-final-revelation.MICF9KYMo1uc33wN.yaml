    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, yours becomes a journey without end. You cease aging, no
      longer suffer age-related penalties to ability scores, and cannot be
      magically aged. Any spells you cast of the conjuration (teleport)
      subschool or with the fire or light descriptor are automatically enlarged
      without affecting their spell level.</p>
