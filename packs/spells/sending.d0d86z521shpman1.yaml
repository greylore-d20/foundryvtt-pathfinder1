  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a
    short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you
    if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with
    an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the <i><i>sending</i>,</i>
    though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its
    Intelligence. Even if the <i>sending</i> is received, the subject is not
    obligated to act upon it in any manner.</p><p>If the creature in question is
    not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the
    <i>sending</i> does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen
    this chance considerably.)</p>
