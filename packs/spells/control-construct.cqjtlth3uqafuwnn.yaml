      <p>You wrest the control of a construct from its master. For as long as
      you concentrate, you can control the construct as if you were its master.
      You must make a Spellcraft check each round to maintain control. The DC of
      the Spellcraft check is (10 + the construct's HD). If the construct's
      creator or master is present and trying to control the construct, you both
      must make opposed Spellcraft checks each round to control the
      construct.</p>
