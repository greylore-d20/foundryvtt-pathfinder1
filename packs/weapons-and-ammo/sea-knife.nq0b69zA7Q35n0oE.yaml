      S</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A sea-knife is a long-handled weapon with a
      short blade. It is designed to be strapped to the ankle or foot of the
      wielder, pointing downward and jutting out beyond the wearer's leg.
      Donning or removing a sea-knife is a full-round action. The wearer cannot
      use a leg with a sea-knife strapped to it for walking or running. A
      sea-knife can be used as a light melee weapon when the wielder is
      swimming, flying, or prone. This allows the wielder to use a two-handed
      weapon, or wield a weapon with one hand and carry a shield, and still make
      off-hand attacks with the sea-knife. Attacks made with a sea-knife take a
      -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls in addition to all other attack
      penalties.</p>
