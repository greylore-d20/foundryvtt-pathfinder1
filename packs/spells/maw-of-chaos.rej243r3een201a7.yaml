      <p>This spell creates a rip in reality that plunges into the interspatial
      vortices that constantly churn with the raw destructive chaos of the
      Abyss. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the <i>Maw of Chaos</i>
      attempts a drag combat maneuver check against every creature within 40
      feet, using your caster level plus your primary spellcasting ability
      modifier in place of a CMB. If a creature is dragged into a <i>Maw of
      Chaos</i>, the area erupts in a surge of chaotic energy and the creature
      takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Only one such eruption can
      occur per round.  Creatures dragged adjacent to the <i>Maw of Chaos</i>
      become entangled by the frayed strands of reality being torn apart at the
      rim of the <i>Maw of Chaos</i>. Escape requires a successful Escape Artist
      check or grapple check against a DC equal to 10 plus the spell's save DC.
      Every creature without the chaotic subtype that ends its turn adjacent to
      a <i>Maw of Chaos</i> takes 2 points of damage to each ability score.
      Creatures with the lawful subtype take double this amount of damage;
      creatures with the chaotic subtype take no damage.  Calling, summoning,
      and teleportation effects used within 30 feet of the <i>Maw of Chaos</i>
      or that cause a creature to appear within 30 feet of a <i>Maw of Chaos</i>
      are redirected, causing the creature to arrive adjacent to the <i>Maw of
      Chaos</i> rather than at its intended destination. Unattended objects
      (including dead bodies) adjacent to the <i>Maw of Chaos</i> are drawn into
      it and affected as by <i>disintegrate</i> at the beginning of the caster's
      next turn.</p>
