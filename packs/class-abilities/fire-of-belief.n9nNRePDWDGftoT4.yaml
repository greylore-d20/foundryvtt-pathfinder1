  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can unleash a gout of holy or unholy flame that sears one target
      within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The target takes 1d6 points of
      fire damage plus half your inquisitor level (minimum +1). If you are good,
      the flames only harm nongood targets. If you are evil, the flames only
      harm nonevil targets. If you are neither good nor evil, when you gain this
      ability you must decide whether the flames harm only nongood or nonevil
      targets; once you make this decision, it cannot be changed (though if your
      alignment changes, the effect of the flames changes appropriately). You
      can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
