    value: >-
      <p>By sacrificing a living creature, you create the grisly illusion of
      viscera and gore splattered about the nearby area. When the casting time
      is complete, the walls drip with blood and the floor is slick with
      unidentifiable lumps of meat and other signs of a massacre. Anyone
      entering the area must attempt a Will save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds.
      This is a mind-affecting effect. If a creature succeeds at its save, it
      can see the semi-real nature of the illusion.  The room itself is covered
      in a layer of slippery, semi-real gore. Any creature attempting to walk
      within or through the area of gore can move at half normal speed with a DC
      10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round, and failure
      by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill for details).
      Creatures that don't move on their turns don't need to attempt this check
      and are not considered flat-footed. A creature that succeeded at its Will
      save gains a +5 bonus on the Acrobatics check.</p>
