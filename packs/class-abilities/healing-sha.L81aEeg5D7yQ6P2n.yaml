  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A shaman soothes the wounds of those she touches. This acts as cure
      light wounds, using the shamanâ€™s caster level. Once a creature has
      benefited from the healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24
      hours.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, this acts as cure moderate wounds.</p>
