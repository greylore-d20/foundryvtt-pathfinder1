  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, your moment of destiny is at hand. Any critical threats
      made against you only confirm if the second roll results in a natural 20
      on the die. Any critical threats you score with a spell are automatically
      confirmed. Once per day, you can automatically succeed at one caster level
      check made to overcome spell resistance. You must use this ability before
      making the roll.</p>
