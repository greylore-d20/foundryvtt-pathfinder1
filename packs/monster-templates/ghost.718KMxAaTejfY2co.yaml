      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes<p>“Ghost” is an acquired template
      that can be added to any living creature that has a Charisma score of at
      least 6. A ghost retains all the base creature's statistics and special
      abilities except as noted here.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as the
      base creature +2.<p><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead. Do
      not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points.
      It gains the incorporeal subtype.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> A ghost gains a
      deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier. It loses the base
      creature's natural armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses
      not from force effects or ghost touch items.<p><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all
      of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class
      levels remain unchanged. Ghosts use their Charisma modifiers to determine
      bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b>
      A ghost retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save
      those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Ghosts gain channel
      resistance +4, darkvision 60 ft., the incorporeal ability, and all of the
      immunities granted by its undead traits. Ghosts also gain the rejuvenation
      ability.<p><em>Rejuvenation (Su):</em> In most cases, it's difficult to
      destroy a ghost through simple combat: the “destroyed” spirit restores
      itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only
      temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a ghost is to
      determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it
      from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may
      require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for
      each different ghost by the GM.<p><b>Speed:</b> Ghosts lose their previous
      speeds and gain a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect), unless the base creature
      has a higher fly speed.<p><b>Melee and Ranged Attacks:</b> A ghost loses
      all of the base creature's attacks. If it could wield weapons in life, it
      can wield ghost touch weapons as a ghost.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A
      ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, but any
      relying on physical contact do not function. In addition, a ghost gains
      one ghost special attack from the list below for every 3 points of CR
      (minimum 1—the first ability chosen must always be corrupting touch). The
      save DC against a ghost's special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost's HD +
      ghost's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Additional ghost
      abilities beyond these can be designed at the GM's
      discretion.<p><em>Corrupting Gaze (Su):</em> The ghost is disfigured
      through age or violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet
      that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage (Fortitude save negates
      Charisma damage but not physical damage).<p><em>Corrupting Touch
      (Su):</em> All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part
      of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the
      ghost inflicts a number of d6s equal to its CR in damage. This damage is
      not negative energy—it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches
      from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to
      this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage
      reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.<p><em>Draining
      Touch (Su):</em> The ghost died while insane or diseased. It gains a touch
      attack that drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects on a
      hit. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to
      itself. When a ghost makes a draining touch attack, it cannot use its
      standard ghostly touch attack.<p><em>Frightful Moan (Su):</em> The ghost
      died in the throes of crippling terror. It can emit a frightful moan as a
      standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed
      on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic
      mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the
      moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24
      hours.<p><em>Malevolence (Su): </em>The ghost's jealousy of the living is
      particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a
      creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar
      spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher),
      except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the
      ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack
      with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune
      to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours.<p><em>Telekinesis
      (Su):</em> The ghost's death involved great physical trauma. The ghost can
      use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds (caster level
      12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher).<p><b>Abilities:</b>
      Cha +4; as an incorporeal undead creature, a ghost has no Strength or
      Constitution score.<p><b>Skills:</b> Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on
      Perception and Stealth skill checks. A ghost always treats Climb,
      Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion),
      Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills.
      Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.</p>
