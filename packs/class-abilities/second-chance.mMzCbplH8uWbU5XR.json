Once per day as a standard action, you can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.qr6qcx8zqum6jhc4]{Atonement} as a spell-like ability, targeting a creature that has violated the tenets of a religion you both share or that freely desires to convert to your alignment. If costly material components are required for the atonement, you may choose to accept a permanent negative level as a sacrifice in place of those components. The target of this effect also receives the benefits of a cure serious wounds spell as part of the effects of the atonement.</p>"
