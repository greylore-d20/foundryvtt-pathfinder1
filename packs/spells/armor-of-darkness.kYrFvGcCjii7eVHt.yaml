      <p>This spell envelops the target in shadows that can, if you desire,
      conceal the creature's features. It grants the recipient a +3 deflection
      bonus to Armor Class (+1 for every 4 caster levels, to a maximum bonus of
      +8). The subject can see through the armor and gains darkvision to 60
      feet. The subject gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against any holy,
      good, or light spells or effects. Undead creatures under the effect gain
      +4 turn resistance.</p>
