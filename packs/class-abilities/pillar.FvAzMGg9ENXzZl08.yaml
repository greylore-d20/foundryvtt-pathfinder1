      <p>You create a 5-foot-by-5-foot pillar of ice, packed dirt, or tangled
      roots with a height of up to 15 feet. This takes 1 full round, during
      which time the ground within the affected area rumbles conspicuously, but
      it rises only at the end of the round. You can’t create a pillar in an
      area occupied by or adjacent to any creatures unless all such creatures
      are willing, and if an unwilling creature moves into the area before the
      pillar finishes rising, it can disrupt and foil the pillar. As the pillar
      springs into existence, willing creatures and objects within the affected
      area are lifted with it.<p>The pillar can’t be used to crush creatures or
      objects against the ceiling; if insufficient room is available for the
      pillar and any creatures or objects on it, the pillar reaches only the
      maximum possible height. You can’t create a pillar under a Large or larger
      creature.<p>The pillar has AC 4, hardness 0, and 3 hit points per
      kineticist level. Scaling the pillar’s rough edges requires a successful
      DC 15 Climb check. When destroyed, when you create a new pillar, or when a
      number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus (minimum 1) have
      elapsed, the pillar crumbles, melts, or withers away, gently lowering
      anything on it back to the ground.</p>
