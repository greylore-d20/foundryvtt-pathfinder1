      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This one-handed weapon is similar to a
      nunchaku in that it consists of a pair of bars linked with heavy chain.
      However, a flindbar's bars are made of iron and are capped with a ring of
      spikes or studs. Since it's much heaver than a nunchaku, it is not a light
      weapon.</p>
