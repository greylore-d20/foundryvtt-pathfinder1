  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per rage, the barbarian can attack the floor around her as a
      standard action. This attack automatically hits and deals damage normally.
      If the barbarian manages to deal more damage than the floorâ€™s hardness,
      the space she occupies and all of the squares adjacent to her become
      difficult terrain. Creatures in these squares, except the barbarian, must
      make a DC 15 Reflex save or be knocked prone.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
