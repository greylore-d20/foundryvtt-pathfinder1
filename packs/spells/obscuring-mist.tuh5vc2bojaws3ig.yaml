  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures
      all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has
      concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have
      total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to
      locate the target).</p><p>A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a
      <i>gust of wind</i> spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind
      (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A <i>fireball, flame strike</i>,
      or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's
      area. A <i>Wall of Fire</i> burns away the fog in the area into which it
      deals damage.</p><p>This spell does not function underwater.</p>
