  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can cause fate to twist so that it benefits a creature within
      30 feet for 1 round. Whenever that creature is targeted by an effect that
      requires an attack roll, including weapon attacks, the attacker must roll
      twice and take the worse result.</p>

      <p>At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1
      round.</p>

      <p>A witch cannot use this ability on herself.</p>

      <p>Hexes that affect the fortune hex, such as cackle, also affect
      protective luck.</p>
