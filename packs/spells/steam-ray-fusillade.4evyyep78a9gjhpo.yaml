      <p>For the duration of the spell, you can fire three rays of steam once
      per round as a standard action (and you also fire three such rays as part
      of casting the spell). These rays function similarly to the rays from
      <i>scorching ray</i> (you can fire them at close range, they're ranged
      touch attacks, they deal 4d6 points of fire damage each, and spell
      resistance negates  them) except that they work both underwater and above
      water without a caster level check for being a fire spell.</p>
