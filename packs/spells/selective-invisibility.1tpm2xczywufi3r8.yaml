  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon casting this spell, you turn invisible, as per the
      <i>invisibility</i> spell, and you choose a second target. That creature
      can still see you as though you were not invisible, and you can attack
      that creature without ending the <i>invisibility</i> effect on you.
      However, if you attack any other creature, this spell ends. If you cast
      this spell multiple times, you can attack any of the affected creatures
      without ending the spell.</p>
