    value: >-
      <p>You create an aura around the target weapon that weakens a foe's
      magical defenses. The first time each round the weapon damages a creature
      with spell resistance, that creature's spell resistance is reduced by 5
      for 1 round. This reduction is not cumulative for multiple attacks within
      the same round, even if the target is struck by different weapons, each
      affected by a different casting of <i>splinter spell resistance</i>.
      However, the same creature's spell resistance can be reduced on multiple
      rounds by subsequent hits.</p>
