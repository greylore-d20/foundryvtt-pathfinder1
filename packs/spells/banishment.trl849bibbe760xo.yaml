  shortDescription: >-
    <p>A <i>banishment</i> spell is a more powerful version of the
    <i>dismissal</i> spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of
    your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be
    banished.</p><p>You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting
    at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise
    opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your
    caster level check to overcome the target's  Spell Resistance (if any), and
    the saving throw DC increases by 2.</p><p>Certain rare items might work
    twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each
    providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against Spell Resistance and
    increasing the save DC by 4).</p>
