      <p><i>Quench</i> is often used to put out forest fires and other
      conflagrations. It extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its
      area.</p><p>The spell also dispels any fire spells in its area, though you
      must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum +15)
      against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the
      caster level of the fire spell.</p><p>Each creature with the fire subtype
      within the area of a <i>quench</i> spell takes 1d6 points of damage per
      caster level (maximum 10d6, no save allowed).</p><p>Alternatively, you can
      target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame.
      The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless
      it succeeds on a Will save. Artifacts are immune to this effect.</p>
