  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You wrap your mind in phantasms of crippling doubt that assail any who
      dare harm you. When a creature within the mantle's radius attacks you or
      attempts to affect you with a harmful effect, it must succeed at a Will
      save as these spectres of uncertainty force themselves into its mind.
      Ongoing effects trigger the mantle only if the creature consciously
      directs them against you. A given creature need only roll a saving throw
      against your <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> at most once per round. If the
      creature's attack or effect against you was a psychic spell or spell-like
      ability, that creature's save takes a -4 penalty. A creatures that fails
      its save against your <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> is affected for 1d4+1 rounds,
      during which time it is shaken, cannot flank, and no longer threatens
      creatures within its reach. In addition, it takes a -2 penalty on saves
      against mind-affecting effects, which stacks with the penalties for being
      shaken. If your <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> affects a creature that is already
      shaken, that creature's fear level doesn't increase. Instead, mounting
      doubts stagger the creature for 1 round and deal 1d4 points of Wisdom and
      Charisma damage to it.  Spell resistance applies against assaults from a
      <i>Mantle of Doubt</i>, and immunity to fear or mind-affecting effects
      negates the spell's effects. If you are immune to fear or mind-affecting
      effects, you can still cast <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> on yourself.</p>
