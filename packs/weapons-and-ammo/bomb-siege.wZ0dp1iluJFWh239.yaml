      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>A bomb is a metal canister filled with metal balls and black powder
      that can be used as ammunition in catapults and trebuchets or carried by
      two Medium creatures or one Large creature to its destination. A bomb
      either explodes on impact (if fired from a catapult or trebuchet, or
      within 3 rounds of a fuse being lit if carried).</p>

      <p>When it explodes, it deals <b>6d6 points of piercing and
      bludgeoning</b> damage to all creatures and objects within <b>30 feet</b>
      of the target square.</p>

      <h3>Mishap</h3>

      <p>On a siege engine mishap, this ammunition explodes before it is
      launched, dealing its damage to the siege engine and all nearby creatures
      and wooden objects as if one of the spaces of the siege engine (crew
      leader's choice) were the target square. It ignores the hardness of wood
      and stone.</p>
