You may select from the following options.</p><p><i>Approach</i>: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.</p><p><i>Drop</i>: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.</p><p><i>Fall</i>: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.</p><p><i>Flee</i>: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.</p><p><i>Halt</i>: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.</p><p>If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.</p>",
