      <p>You can see normally through natural fog and smoke, as well as any fog
      and smoke that you (but not others) magically create. A number of times
      per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence bonus, you can touch another
      creature as a standard action to grant it this vision for 1 hour.</p>
