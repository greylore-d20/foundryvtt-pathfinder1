      <p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more
      mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without
      their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not
      fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to
      a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those
      patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single
      source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs.
      While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a
      curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or
      temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small
      group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and
      revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through
      fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: Any.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Dice</b>: d8.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>

      <h2>Class Skills</h2>

      <p>The oracle’s class skills are <em>Craft</em> (<em>Int</em>),
      <em>Diplomacy</em> (<em>Cha</em>), <em>Heal</em> (<em>Wis</em>),
      <em>Knowledge</em> (history) (<em>Int</em>), <em>Knowledge</em> (planes)
      (<em>Int</em>), <em>Knowledge</em> (religion) (<em>Int</em>),
      <em>Profession</em> (<em>Wis</em>), <em>Sense Motive</em> (<em>Wis</em>),
      and <em>Spellcraft</em> (<em>Int</em>). In addition, oracles receive
      additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>

      <p><b>Skill Ranks per Level</b>: 4 + <em>Int</em> modifier.</p>
