  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create floating swords of the type used as the material component
      for this spell (such as a rapier or scimitar) and magically propel them at
      your target. You can create one sword for every 2 caster levels that you
      possess, up to a maximum of five swords at 10th level. You must have line
      of effect between you and the target, and the target must be within the
      spell's range. You make a ranged attack roll for each sword (with no
      penalties for range increments or using melee weapons as ranged weapons);
      each attack has the same threat range and critical modifier and deals the
      same damage as a standard sword of the type expended. Swords created by
      this spell disappear after striking (or missing) their targets.</p>
