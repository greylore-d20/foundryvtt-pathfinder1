    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>blur</i>, except that the <i>blur</i>ring
      occurs only when you move at least 10 feet on your turn and ceases at the
      end of your movement. It is therefore mainly used to thwart attacks on
      your turn, such as attacks of opportunity. If you move at least twice your
      speed on your turn, the <i>blur</i>ring lasts until the start of your next
      turn.</p>
