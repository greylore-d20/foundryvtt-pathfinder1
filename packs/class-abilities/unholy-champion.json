      "value": "<p>At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a @Compendium[pf1.spells.trl849bibbe760xo]{Banishment}, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the @Compendium[pf1.spells.trl849bibbe760xo]{Banishment}&nbsp;effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>"
