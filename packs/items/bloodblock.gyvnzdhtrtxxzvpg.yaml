      <p>This gooey, pinkish substance helps treat wounds. Using a dose gives
      you a +5 alchemical bonus on Heal checks for providing first aid, treating
      wounds made by caltrops or similar objects, or treating deadly wounds. A
      dose of bloodblock ends a bleed effect as if you had made a DC 15 Heal
      check. When treating deadly wounds, using a dose of bloodblock counts as
      one use of a healer's kit (and grants the +5 bonus stated above).</p>
