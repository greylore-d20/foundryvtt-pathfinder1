      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      none</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> 10 (disposable);
      <strong>Usage</strong> 1 charge</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This cylindrical
      device has a nozzle at one end and a handle on one side. When activated as
      a standard action, a fire extinguisher creates a 15-foot cone of misty
      vapor that swiftly extinguishes fires within its area of effect. Against
      magical fire effects, such as those created by a <em>wall of fire</em> or
      similar spell, the fire extinguisher only extinguishes the part of the
      larger effect its vapors directly contact. Continual magic flames, such as
      those of a <em>flaming</em> weapon or fire creature, are suppressed for 6
      rounds before they automatically reignite. To extinguish an instantaneous
      fire effect or spell, the wielder must use a readied action with the fire
      extinguisher to counter the effect; this can cancel the entire effect,
      provided the source of the effect is in the extinguisher's area of
      effect.</p><p>When used against a creature of the fire subtype, a blast
      from a fire extinguisher deals 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 15 halves).
      A breathing creature exposed to a direct blast from a fire extinguisher is
      not harmed as long as the area is relatively well-ventilated-using a fire
      extinguisher in a confined area with poor or no ventilation can result in
      slow suffocation (at the GM's
      discretion).</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 26;
