  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian is always considered to have a running start when
      attempting an Acrobatics check to jump.</p>

      <p>In addition, she gains a +8 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump.</p>

      <p>Finally, if the barbarian falls, she halves the total distance fallen
      for the purposes of determining damage taken from the fall.</p>
