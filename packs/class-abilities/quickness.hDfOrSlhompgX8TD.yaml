  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to grant
      supernatural quickness and reflexes to yourself or a willing living
      creature you touch. This functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.s9amdo5398alb5p0]{Haste}, but the bonus to AC and
      on Reflex saving throws increases to +2. This effect lasts for 1 round per
      occultist level you possess.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>
