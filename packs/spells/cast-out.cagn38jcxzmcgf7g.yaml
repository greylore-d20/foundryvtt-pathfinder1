    value: >-
      <p>With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any
      magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per
      caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check against
      any <i>magic jar</i> effect (including a ghost's malevolence ability) or
      enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the
      highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a
      targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell, except <i>cast out</i> can dispel one
      such spell for every four caster levels you possess. A successful Will
      save halves the damage and limits the dispelling to a single spell or
      effect.</p>
