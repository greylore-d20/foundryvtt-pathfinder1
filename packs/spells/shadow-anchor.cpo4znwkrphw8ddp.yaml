    value: >-
      <p>The target's shadow becomes a flexible tether to its current square.
      The creature can move up to 5 feet from that square without penalty.
      Moving farther than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to
      make a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMB of 10 + 1/2 your
      caster level + your Intelligence modifier (if a witch or wizard) or
      Charisma modifier (if a bard or sorcerer). The target takes a -1 penalty
      for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing
      this check means the target's move is wasted and it cannot move farther
      away. If it fails this check by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet toward the
      tether square and is knocked prone. If it beats the check by 10 or more,
      the spell ends. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast
      shadows or reflections. If the target uses a teleportation effect or
      leaves the current plane, the spell ends.</p>
