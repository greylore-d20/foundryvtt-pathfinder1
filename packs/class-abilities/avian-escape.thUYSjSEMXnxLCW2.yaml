  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The subject changes shape to elude an attacking enemy. The mesmerist
      can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an enemyâ€™s
      attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as beast shape III). Though
      the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics for a
      raven (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 133).</p>

      <p>This is a polymorph effect.</p>
