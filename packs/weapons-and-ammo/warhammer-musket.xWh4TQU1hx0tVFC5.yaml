      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This musket has a warhammer head at the end of its barrel, which allows
      it to be used as both a musket and a warhammer. It is considered a double
      weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this
      weapon.</p>

      <p>If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component
      and the warhammer are considered broken. A warhammer musket uses either a
      bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as
      ammunition.</p>
