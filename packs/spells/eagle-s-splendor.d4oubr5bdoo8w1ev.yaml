      <p>The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally
      forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the
      usual benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the
      Charisma modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers (and other spellcasters
      who rely on Charisma) affected by this spell do not gain any additional
      bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they
      cast while under this spell's effect do increase.</p>
