      gain @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.ZmQkRk93nbHxsQSt]{Improved Grapple} as a
      bonus feat, even if you do not meet its prerequisites. Once per round when
      you succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check, you can deal 1d6 points of
      negative energy damage to the target of your grapple. This damage
      increases by 1d6 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, to a maximum
      of 5d6 at 20th level.</p>
