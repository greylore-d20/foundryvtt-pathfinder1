      <p><strong>Granted Powers:</strong> You see death not as something to be
      feared, but as a final rest and reward for a life well spent. The taint of
      undeath is a mockery of what you hold
      dear.</p><p><strong>Subdomains:</strong>

      Rest (Sp)}: Your touch can fill a creature with lethargy, causing a living
      creature to become staggered for 1 round as a melee touch attack. If you
      touch a staggered living creature, that creature falls asleep for 1 round
      instead. Undead creatures touched are staggered for a number of rounds
      equal to your Wisdom modifier. You can use this ability a number of times
      per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.KF3SgIKeBACJhSZ1]{Ward
      Against Death (Su)}: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that wards
      against death for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level.
      Living creatures in this area are immune to all death effects, energy
      drain, and effects that cause negative levels. This ward does not remove
      negative levels that a creature has already gained, but the negative
      levels have no effect while the creature is inside the warded area. These
      rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><h3>Domain
