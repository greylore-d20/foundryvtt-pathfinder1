When used properly, it helps you keep your balance when crossing narrow walkways. Using a balancing pole grants you a +1 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Acrobatics</em> checks made to traverse a narrow surface.</p>\n<p>Poles (of all sorts) are also commonly used to probe for hidden or obscured things in nearby spaces, or to trigger location-based traps. If you vault with a pole as part of a running jump, you gain a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on your <em>Acrobatics</em> check (but must let go of the pole in the process). A pole can also prop doors open or closed, serve as a place to hang a lantern or secure a bound foe, or be used as a lever to lift a heavy object up to 5 feet away.</p>"
