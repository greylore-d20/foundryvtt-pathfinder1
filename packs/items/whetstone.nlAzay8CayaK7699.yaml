      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>A whetstone allows you to sharpen a blade by sliding it against the
      stone at a precise angle. Honing a blade with a whetstone requires about
      15 minutes of work and grants the weapon a +1 bonus on your damage roll
      the first time you hit with it. This only works on nonmagical blades.</p>
