    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent can, as an immediate action, attempt an Escape
      Artist check in place of a Reflex saving throw against any effect that
      would impose the entangled condition on her. Additionally, once per day
      when she is the target of a grapple combat maneuver, a rogue with this
      talent can attempt an Escape Artist check as an immediate action, using
      the result of the skill check in place of her CMD against that combat
      maneuver attempt. A rogue can use this second ability one additional time
      per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses. A rogue must be trained in
      Escape Artist to select this talent.</p>
