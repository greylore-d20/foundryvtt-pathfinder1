    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, as a move action, you can extol the virtues of yourself
      or an ally within 60 feet that you can see. This causes the target to shed
      light like a torch for 1 minute, and while the effect lasts, you can
      expend a daily use of your touch of glory domain ability as an immediate
      action to add 1d6 to an attack, saving throw, skill check, or ability
      check attempted by the target; for a roll to confirm a critical hit or
      save against a fear effect, you instead add 1d12. You can use this ability
      once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every 4
      levels beyond 8th.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Divine Presence power of the Glory Domain.</p>
