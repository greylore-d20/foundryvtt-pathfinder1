  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can give a creature a vision of madness as a melee touch attack.
      Choose one of the following: attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks.
      The target receives a bonus to the chosen rolls equal to 1/2 your cleric
      level (minimum +1) and a penalty to the other two types of rolls equal to
      1/2 your cleric level (minimum â€“1). This effect fades after 3 rounds. You
      can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
