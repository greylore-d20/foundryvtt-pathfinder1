There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gray Dust Shot Cartridge</em></strong>: (<strong>Source</strong> <em>Heroes of Golarion pg. 18</em>) This version of the gray dust cartridge can be loaded only into a weapon with the scatter quality. It functions similarly to a gray dust cartridge, except upon impact it bursts into a 20-foot-radius cloud. Creatures within the cloud take a -5 penalty on concentration checks to cast spells. This cloud dissipates in 1d6 rounds in still air. Light wind disperses the cloud in 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
