  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell summons a barghest from the Abyssal realm of Basalfeyst to
      serve the caster, functioning similarly to
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.kyo0kwhw2jhuztju]{summon monster} save that it may
      only be used to summon a single barghest. Although the summoned barghest
      does not have the feed ability, if you are at least caster level 9th the
      summoned barghest appears with 2 growth points (and with it the
      appropriate bonuses to its attacks, CMB, saves, skill checks, hit points,
      and caster level).</p>
