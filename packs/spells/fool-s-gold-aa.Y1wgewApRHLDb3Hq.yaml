      <p>You cast this spell on one or more gold pieces, which make those who
      have them more vulnerable to your magics. A creature with one or more of
      these gold pieces in its possession must attempt a Will save (at this
      spell’s save DC) the first time the creature is forced to attempt a saving
      throw against a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability you
      create. If the creature fails, it takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws
      against your magic effects as long as the gold piece is in its possession.
      Additionally, if it fails a saving throw against a magic ability of yours
      that is not harmless and has a duration, the duration is doubled for that
      creature.</p>
