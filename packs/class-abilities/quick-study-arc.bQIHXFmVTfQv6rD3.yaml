  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can prepare a spell in place of an existing spell by
      expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. Using this ability is a
      full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. The arcanist
      must be able to reference her spellbook when using this ability. The spell
      prepared must be of the same level as the spell being replaced.</p>
