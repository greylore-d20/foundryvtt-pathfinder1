      <p>This spell creates an explosion of conjured metal pellets, striking
      everything within its area and dealing 1d8 points of piercing damage per
      two caster levels, maximum 5d8. This damage is subject to damage
      reduction. If the material component is made of cold iron (costing 50 gp),
      silver (costing 20 gp), or adamantine (costing 100 gp), the resulting
      blast can overcome damage reduction of the appropriate type. The pellets
      disappear after the spell is cast and the damage is dealt.</p>
