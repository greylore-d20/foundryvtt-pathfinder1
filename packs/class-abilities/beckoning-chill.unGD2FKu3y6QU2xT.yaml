  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes one creature within 30 feet to become more
      susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature
      takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If
      the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by beckoning chill,
      the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round.</p>

      <p>Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for
      24 hours.</p>
