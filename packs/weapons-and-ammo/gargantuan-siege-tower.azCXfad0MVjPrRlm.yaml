      of stout construction, a siege tower consists of a tall protective shell
      with a roof section. The lower story of the tower contains the crew
      members who propel the tower, and provides total cover to those within. A
      siege tower with the broken condition moves at half speed. If a siege
      tower is destroyed, the entire tower collapses. Treat this as a <a
      href="Rules.aspx?Name=Cave-Ins%20and%20Collapses%20(CR%208)&amp;Category=Dungeon%20Terrain">cave-in</a>.</p><p>The
      upper section of a siege tower provides improved cover for a number of
      soldiers (see below) and may have pierced walls allowing creatures to fire
      ranged weapons out the sides. The roof section may have a battlement and
      may mount a siege engine of the siege tower's size or smaller and a
      corvus. Siege towers have a base speed of 15 (or 10 feet if protected with
      medium or heavy armor).</p><p>Siege towers have a hardness of 5, and hit
      points based on their size. A Large siege tower has 60 hit points, a Huge
      one has 240 hit points, a Gargantuan one has 640 hit points, and a
      Colossal one has 1,250 hit points.</p><p></p><h3>Table 3-17: Siege Tower
