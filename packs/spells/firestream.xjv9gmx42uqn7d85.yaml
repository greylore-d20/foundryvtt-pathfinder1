      <p>A rushing stream of fire sprays from your outstretched hand, dealing
      2d6 points of fire damage to every creature in the area. Each round you
      continue to concentrate on the spell, you can select a new area for it to
      affect. <i>Firestream</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in
      the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold,
      copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier
      shatters or breaks through it, the firestream may continue beyond the
      barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any
      other spell effect does.</p>
