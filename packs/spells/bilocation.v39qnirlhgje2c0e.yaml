  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The spell creates an identical copy of you, along with everything you
      wear and carry, anywhere you choose within range; you exist in two places
      at once until the spell ends. You and the duplicate use the same
      statistics and share the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage,
      for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly,
      if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both
      wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you
      or the duplicate drops or gives away something you're carrying, the item
      disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn't duplicate
      artifacts; any you possess remain on you.  You perceive sensory
      information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The
      spell enables you to process the sensations so you don't find them
      disorienting.  When you take any action, you choose which of your bodies
      performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For
      instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell,  you can use
      either body as the point of origin, but the other body can't also take a
      standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round
      action, you couldn't take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take
      any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say
      different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn't
      move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move
      your speed once as a free action.  The two bodies are affected by attacks,
      spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse
      effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to
      differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in
      the area of the same <i>fireball</i>, you would attempt the saving throw
      only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by
      <i>hold person</i>, both would become paralyzed on a failed save. Both
      bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific
      number of creatures, and they can't be chosen more than once for such
      effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat
      effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don't count
      as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you
      use that can target only creatures other than yourself.  Any magical
      effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you're
      bilocating. For example, the <i>hold person</i> spell mentioned above
      would lose 2 rounds' worth of duration per round until your duplicate
      disappeared. If you were under an eagle's splendor e ffect t hat h ad 1
      minute remaining when you cast <i>bilocation</i>, the effect would end
      after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a
      minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of
      rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your
      bodies for that round.  When the spell ends, you decide whether you or
      your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate. If
      you are carrying artifacts when you do this, they transfer with your
      consciousness.</p>
