      <p>When the target of <em>demon dream</em> is a worshiper of a demon lord
      or Lamashtu, the caster has the option of making the spell function
      instead as a @Compendium[pf1.spells.ifcnx1yyw6e7ousm]{Dream} spell.
      Otherwise, this spell functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.siv3ub7hbmcklf8c]{Nightmare} (see <em>Pathfinder
      RPG Core Rulebook 316</em>), save that the subject matter of the dream
      always involves demons. Upon waking from a <em>demon dream</em>, the
      victim must make a saving throw against the spell to resist taking 1d6
      points of Wisdom drain from the unsettling, madness- inducing dream â€” this
      is in addition to the damage and fatigue normally caused by the
      <em>nightmare</em>.</p>
