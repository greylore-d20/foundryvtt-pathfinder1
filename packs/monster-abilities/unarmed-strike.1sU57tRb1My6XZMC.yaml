  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the
      purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.</p><p>An
      unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use
      the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your
      Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.</p><p>Unarmed
      strikes do not count as natural weapons (see Combat in core rulebook).</p>
