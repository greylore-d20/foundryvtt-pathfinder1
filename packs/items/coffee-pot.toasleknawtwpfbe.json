Heating the <em>pot</em> forces boiling water through the tube and into the grounds. A glass knob at the top of the tube allows you to see the color of the brew and stop when it is sufficiently strong. It can brew up to 4 cups of coffee at a time. It can also be used to make <em>tea</em>, steep medicinal herbs, or just boil water.</p>"
