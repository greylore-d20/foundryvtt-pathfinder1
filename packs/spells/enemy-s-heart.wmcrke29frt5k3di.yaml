  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You cut out an enemy's heart and consume it, absorbing that enemy's
      power as your own. As part of casting this spell, you perform a coup de
      grace with a slashing weapon on a helpless, living adjacent target. If the
      target dies, you eat its heart to gain the spell's benefits. If the target
      survives, the spell is not wasted and you can try again as long as you
      continue concentrating on the spell. When you consume the heart, you gain
      the benefits of a <i>death knell</i> spell, except you gain 1d8 temporary
      hit points +1 per Hit Die of the target, and the bonus to Strength is a
      profane bonus.</p>
