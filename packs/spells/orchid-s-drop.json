One by-product of their experiments was the orchid's drop formula. This extract, distilled from a much-diluted drop of the nectar of a sun orchid flower, can transform an alchemist's mutagen into a potent healing tonic.</p><p>As long as you're under the effects of orchid's drop, drinking a dose of your mutagen heals you of 2d10 points of damage. For the spell's duration, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving throws.</p>",
