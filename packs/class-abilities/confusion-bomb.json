A creature that takes a direct hit from a confusion bomb takes damage from the bomb and is under the effect of a @Compendium[pf1.spells.n0bsyxchnigkkuqo]{Confusion} spell for 1 round per caster level of the alchemist. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead).</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
