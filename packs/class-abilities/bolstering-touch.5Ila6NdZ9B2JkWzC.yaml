  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, bracing it
      against frightening situations and allowing it to remain calm. The first
      fear effect that would affect the subject within the next hour is
      suppressed for the first 1d4 rounds of its effect. If you touch a creature
      currently suffering from an ongoing fear effect, this ability instead
      suppresses the ongoing fear effect for 1 round. The rounds during which
      the subject ignores the triggering fear effect still count against the
      effect’s duration. If the fear effect is suppressed for longer than it
      lasts, the subject isn’t affected by the fear effect at all. You can use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Touch of Glory power of the Glory Domain.</p>
