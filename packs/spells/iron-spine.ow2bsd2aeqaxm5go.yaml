  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You launch an ingot of iron at the target. If you succeed at a ranged
      touch attack, the target's skeleton or exoskeleton turns into jagged
      shards of cold iron. Whenever the target moves, it takes 1d6 points of
      piercing damage and is sickened for 1 round as metal spines stab into its
      flesh. This damage is subject to damage reduction, but it overcomes damage
      reduction as though it were a weapon of cold iron and magic. A creature
      affected by this spell can choose to remain motionless to avoid taking
      damage. Creatures with DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron and magic affected by
      this spell are nauseated instead of sickened. This spell has no effect on
      a creature that has neither a skeleton nor a hard carapace.</p>
