All wasters are designed to emulate a specific melee weapon (such as a <em>kukri</em> waster or a <em>greatsword</em> waster), and weigh twice as much as the weapons they emulate.</p>\n<p>Using a waster to hone your combat techniques requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 <em>combat maneuver</em> check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> to your <em>CMD</em> against <em>combat maneuvers</em> targeting weapons you wield that match the waster your practiced with. This bonus lasts for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Whether it's the heaviest possible plate armor with a tower shield for <em>cover</em> or elegant layers of cloth that appear incapable of granting any protection, the right armor for the situation is crucial to a successful melee combatant's preparation.</p>"
