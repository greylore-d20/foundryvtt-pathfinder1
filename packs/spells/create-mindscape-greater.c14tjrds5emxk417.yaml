    <p>This spell functions like @Compendium[pf1.spells.nn4gjuby3uovsv78]{create
    mindscape}, except it can affect more creatures, the mindscape lasts longer,
    and you can choose the mindscape's magic trait. You can also direct a number
    of believable creatures at a time equal to your caster level. Greater
    <em>create mindscape</em> can be made permanent with a
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.nsxngq65mbrzgwnm]{permanency} spell by a caster of
    15th level or higher at a cost of 17,500 gp. You and other creatures aware
    of a permanent mindscape can come and go using the
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.90xaelj2ncuzq62n]{mindscape door} spell.</p>
