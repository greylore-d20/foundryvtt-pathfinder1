  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can grant a creature within 30 feet a bit of good luck for 1
      round. The target can call upon this good luck once per round, allowing
      him to reroll any ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill
      check, taking the better result. He must decide to use this ability before
      the first roll is made.</p>

      <p>At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1
      round.</p>

      <p>Once a creature has benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit
      from it again for 24 hours.</p>
