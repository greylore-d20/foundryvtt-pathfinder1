  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This heart-shaped locket is attached to a thin metal chain made of
      looped strands of gold or silver. Inside the locket is a small,
      spring-loaded vial that can hold a single dose of powdered
      <em>poison</em>. Loading the locket with poison carries the same risks as
      applying poison to a weapon. When the locket is opened, the vial is
      shattered by a ball bearing, releasing the powder into the air and
      treating the poison's type as if it were inhaled. The airborne poison
      affects all creatures within 10 feet of the locket.</p>
