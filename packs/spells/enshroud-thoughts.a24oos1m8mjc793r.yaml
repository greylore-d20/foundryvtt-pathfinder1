  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You become warded against the mental prying of others, including the
    effects of divination spells such as <i>detect thoughts</i> and <i>seek</i>
    thoughtsAPG, as well as enchantment spells such as <i>modify
    <i>memory</i></i> and <i>memory</i> lapseAPG. If another creature attempts
    to target you with a mind-affecting spell that  detects or alters your
    thoughts or memories, the caster must succeed at a caster level check
    against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level or the spell fails. Only spells
    that detect or alter your thoughts or memories are blocked by this spell;
    effects such as <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>, <i>d etect e vil</i>, and
    <i>locate creature</i> continue to affect you as normal.</p>
