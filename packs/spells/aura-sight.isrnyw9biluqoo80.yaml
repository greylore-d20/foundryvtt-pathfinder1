    value: >-
      <p>This spell makes your eyes glow and allows you to see alignment auras
      within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <i>detect
      chaos/evil/good/law</i> spell, but <i>aura sight</i> does not require
      concentration, and it discerns an aura's location and power more
      quickly.</p><p>You know the location and power of all chaotic, evil, good,
      and lawful auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a
      creature's Hit Dice or an item's caster level, as noted in the description
      of the <i>detect evil</i> spell. If an item or a creature bearing an aura
      is in line of sight, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to
      determine the aura's strength (one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or
      15 + 1/2 caster level for a non-spell effect).</p><p><i>Aura sight</i> can
      be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 11th level
      or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.</p>
