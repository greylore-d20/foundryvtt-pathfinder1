  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon casting this spell, you are able to gain knowledge from the land
      itself. As you walk through the terrain, it whisper information in a
      language you understand, though the whispering is so rambling it is hard
      to distinguish useful information. This whispering grants you a +4 insight
      bonus on a single Knowledge skill type appropriate to the type of terrain
      you are in. If you are within a cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountain,
      plains, swamp, or water environment, you gain the bonus on Knowledge
      (nature) checks. If you are within an underground environment, you gain
      the bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks. If you are within an urban
      environment, you gain the bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. If you are on
      a plane other than the Material Plane, you gain the bonus on Knowledge
      (planes) checks. If you enter a new terrain, you lose the previous
      terrain's skill bonus and gain the new bonus.</p>
