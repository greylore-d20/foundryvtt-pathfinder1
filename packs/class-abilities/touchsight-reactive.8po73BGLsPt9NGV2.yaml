      <p>Your strands of aether surround you, making it virtually impossible for
      a violent motion to catch you off guard, so long as the motion originates
      within their range. You are never denied your Dexterity bonus to AC
      against attacks from within 30 feet because of being flat-footed or
      because your assailant is unseen or invisible. You always succeed at any
      Perception check to act on the surprise round against opponents within 30
      feet.</p>
