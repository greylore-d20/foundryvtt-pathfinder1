    "shortDescription": "<p>You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently <i>raise</i>d from the dead (such as with <i>raise</i> dead). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric can cast <i>raise</i> dead or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with <i>temporary resurrection</i>, this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently <i>raise</i>d from the dead.</p>"
