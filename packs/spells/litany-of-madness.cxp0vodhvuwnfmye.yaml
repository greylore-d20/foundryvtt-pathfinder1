  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This litany is a sermon of madness. The target is confused. At the start
    of each of its turns, it can make a Will saving throw against the confused
    effect (DC of the spell). If the target fails the save, it continues to be
    confused. If it makes the save, the effect ends.  While subject to this
    spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word
    "litany" in the title.</p>
