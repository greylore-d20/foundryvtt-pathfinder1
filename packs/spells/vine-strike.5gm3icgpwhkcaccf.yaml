  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Bristles burst from your body, lodging in your opponent and blossoming
    into entangling vines as you pummel your target. While this spell is in
    effect, one of your natural attacks or unarmed strikes deals an additional
    1d6 points of damage, and each creature hit with that natural weapon or
    unarmed strike must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled for the
    duration of the spell; on a successful Reflex save, the creature is immune
    to the entangled effect for 1 round. A creature entangled by this spell can
    spend a standard action to remove the vines, but can be entangled again by
    further unarmed strikes.</p>
