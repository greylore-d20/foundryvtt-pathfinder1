  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Food spoils more quickly in hot climates, and Qadirans have become
      experts at using the spices that they trade to help preserve their meals.
      After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and
      alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced
      medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the
      following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a
      character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated
      for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that
      rate maintains the benefit.<br><br><strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is
      of vital importance for retaining a bodyâ€™s water. If a dose of Qadiran
      violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus
      on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the
      next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one
      meal.</p>
