      <p>Creatures with the swarm subtype don't make standard melee attacks.
      Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they
      occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks
      are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A swarm's
      statistics block has "swarm" in the Melee entries, with no attack bonus
      given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as
      shown below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Swarm HD</th><th>Swarm Base

      attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm's description states otherwise.
      Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack's damage to 0, being
      incorporeal, or other special abilities usually give a creature immunity
      (or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have
      acid, blood drain, poison, or other special attacks in addition to normal
      damage.</p><p>Swarms do not threaten creatures, and do not make attacks of
      opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose
      squares they occupy, as described below.</p><p>Swarms possess the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.monster-abilities.Item.WMwjQfyTC5BCoZlf]{distraction}
      universal monster rule. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the
      area of a swarm requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Using
      skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Will
      save.</p>
