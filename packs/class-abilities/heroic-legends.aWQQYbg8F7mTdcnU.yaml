      <p>At 15th level, you may inspire greatness or inspire heroics as a
      <em>bard</em> of your <em>sorcerer</em> level by sacrificing a spell slot
      as a swift or <em>move action</em>. The effect lasts a number of rounds
      equal to the sacrificed spellâ€™s level; this duration is doubled for human
      recipients.</p>
