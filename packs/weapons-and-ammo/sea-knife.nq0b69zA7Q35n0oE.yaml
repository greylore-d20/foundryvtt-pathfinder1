  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A sea-knife is a long-handled weapon with a short blade. It is designed
      to be strapped to the ankle or foot of the wielder, pointing downward and
      jutting out beyond the wearer's leg. Donning or removing a sea-knife is a
      full-round action. The wearer cannot use a leg with a sea-knife strapped
      to it for walking or running. A sea-knife can be used as a light melee
      weapon when the wielder is swimming, flying, or prone. This allows the
      wielder to use a two-handed weapon, or wield a weapon with one hand and
      carry a shield, and still make off-hand attacks with the sea-knife.
      Attacks made with a sea-knife take a -2 circumstance penalty on attack
      rolls in addition to all other attack penalties.</p>
