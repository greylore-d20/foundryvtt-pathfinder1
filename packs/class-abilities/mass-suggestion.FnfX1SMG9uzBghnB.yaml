  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This ability functions just like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zqj5qzyl46af27v0]{Suggestion}, but allows a bard of
      18th level or higher to make a suggestion simultaneously to any number of
      creatures that he has already <em>fascinated</em>. Mass suggestion is an
      <em>enchantment</em> (<em>compulsion</em>), mind-affecting, language
      dependent ability that relies on audible components.</p>
