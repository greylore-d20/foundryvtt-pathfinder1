If you want to add one, select a creature from the list of a summon nature's ally spell. The spell must have a level no higher than 1/2 the creature's CR. Treat the companion as an additional creature in the encounter, awarding XP for defeating it as if it was not an animal companion.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleric, Druid, and Wizard Spells Slots</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>HD</strong></td>\n<td><strong>0</strong></td>\n<td><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3</strong></td>\n<td><strong>4</strong></td>\n<td><strong>5</strong></td>\n<td><strong>6</strong></td>\n<td><strong>7</strong></td>\n<td><strong>8</strong></td>\n<td><strong>9</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-9</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10-12</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13-15</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16-18</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19-21</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22-24</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25+</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>†</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
