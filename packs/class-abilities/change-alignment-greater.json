A permanent, forced change of alignment may be devastating, and some believe it is little better than zealous slavery or mind control. Others consider a good alignment brought about by any means but purity of heart an affront to freedom. This discovery remains controversial at best.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must take the change alignment discovery and the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>"
