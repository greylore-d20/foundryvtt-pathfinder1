    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, when a character with this talent is hit with a melee
      attack, she can redirect the attack to strike at an adjacent creature with
      a free action. The creature targeted must be within melee reach of the
      attack that hit the rogue, and the creature that made the attack against
      the rogue must make a new attack roll against the new target.</p>
