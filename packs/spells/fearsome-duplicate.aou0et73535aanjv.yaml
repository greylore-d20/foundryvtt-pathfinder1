      <p>You create a larger and far more menacing version of yourself that you
      can send forth, manipulate like a puppet, and use to interact with others.
      You can make the duplicate  up to two size categories larger than you are
      and determine a theme as to how it alters your original appearance.
      However, this duplicate always retains some vestiges of your actual
      appearance. Creatures who already know you gain a +2 bonus on saving
      throws made to disbelieve this spell. Your duplicate has no actual
      substance, and you cannot use it to alter its surroundings or to attack or
      otherwise harm creatures it encounters. You can use the duplicate to
      speak, and interact verbally with creatures using the Bluff, Diplomacy,
      and Intimidate skills, and you gain a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate
      checks when using that skill through the duplicate.  You can see, hear,
      taste, and smell your duplicate's surroundings as if you are actually
      present using your Perception skill. While you also remain aware of your
      own immediate surroundings when controlling your duplicate, controlling it
      does take a toll on your senses. You take a -4 penalty on Perception
      checks while you control your duplicate.  The duplicate moves under your
      mental command, and while you need not act out its movements, you must
      take a standard action to control your duplicate for 1 round
      (concentrating on the spell) or it winks out of existence. You can
      maintain control of your duplicate even if you have no line of sight or
      line of effect to it.  The duplicate immediately winks out of existence if
      it is hit by an attack or in the area of a damaging effect, or if it moves
      beyond the maximum range of the spell.</p>
