    value: >-
      <p>You create an area that draws out a creature's emotion aura
      (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</i> 198). Creatures within this area
      constantly glow with colors that represent their current overall 
      emotional state and continue to do so for 1d4 rounds after leaving the
      area. This glow is clearly visible to any creature that can see the
      creature. Emotionless creatures or creatures unaffected by this spell glow
      with a dull purple hue while within the area.</p>
