      "value": "<p>At will, an antipaladin can use @Compendium[pf1.spells.mkgysr5o92kxxn59]{Detect Good}, as the spell. An antipaladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the antipaladin does not detect good in any other object or individual within range.</p>"
