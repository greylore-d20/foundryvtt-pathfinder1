      <p>You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of
      its memories in one of the following ways.</p><p></p><ul><li> Eliminate
      all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot
      negate <i>charm, geas/quest, suggestion,</i> or similar
      spells.<p></p><p></p></li><li> Allow the subject to recall with perfect
      clarity an event it actually experienced.<p></p><p></p></li><li> Change
      the details of an event the subject actually
      experienced.<p></p><p></p></li><li> Implant a memory of an event the
      subject never experienced.</li></ul><p></p><p>Casting the spell takes 1
      round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by
      spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of
      memory you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in
      the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization
      is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during
      this time, the spell is lost.</p><p>A modified memory does not necessarily
      affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the
      creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed
      by the creature as a bad dream, too much wine, or another similar
      excuse.</p>
