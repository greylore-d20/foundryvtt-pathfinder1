      <p>A candle lamp is a small lanternlike device with glass panels and a
      slot to hold a @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.jewqhqesccxrvivd]{candle}.
      It protects the candle from drafts and catches wax drippings. It provides
      the same light as a candle, but can be shuttered such that it only
      illuminates 1 to 3 adjacent squares. You can use a candle lamp to keep
      your hands warm.</p>
