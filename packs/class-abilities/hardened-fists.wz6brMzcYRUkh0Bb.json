Your unarmed strikes deal damage as though you were one size category larger, deal lethal damage, and do not provoke <em>attacks of opportunity</em>. If you have claws, they are affected instead, and they deal damage as though you were one size category larger. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>"
