      <p>The spell's area of effect floods with dangerous radiation. The
      strength of the radiation you create depends on your caster level, as
      detailed below. The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius
      spread that expands normally per the rules for radiation areas of effect
      (see page 55). Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only
      once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The save to resist the
      radiation effects is set by the spell, not the standard save DC for
      radiation.</p><p>Caster <b>Level</b> Radiation <b>Level</b> 6th or lower
      Low 7th-9th Medium 10th-16th High 17th or higher Severe</p>
