  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can take a standard action to violently probe the mind of a single
      intelligent enemy within 100 feet. The target receives a Will save to
      negate the effect and immediately knows the source of this harmful mental
      prying. Those who fail this save are wracked with pain, taking 1d4 points
      of damage for every oracle level you possess. After successfully attacking
      with this ability, you may use a full-round action to sort through the
      jumble of stolen thoughts and memories to make a single Knowledge check
      using the victim's skill bonus. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in
      your mind for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. Treat
      the knowledge gained as if you had used
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.xllxylvvqr82o2d5]{detect thoughts}. This
      is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p>You can use this ability once per day at
      1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every
      five levels beyond 5th.</p>
