Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be targeted by this hex more than once in 24 hours.</p><p>At 15th level, this hex acts as a @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.dzctlcf0sy7o2fa3]{major curse} spell.</p><p>A witch with the cartomancer archetype can combine this hex with her spell deck’s deliver touch spell ability.</p>"
