      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>Most golems are animated by an
      elemental spirit bound within a constructed body, but some creators build
      their golems with a greater purpose in mind. An energized golem is infused
      with the raw elemental energy of the elemental spirit used to animate it,
      granting it increased strength and agility and a host of supernatural
      powers.<p>“Energized” is an acquired template that can be added to any
      golem (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An energized golem
      uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as
      noted here. Save DCs are equal to 10 + half the energized golem’s Hit Dice
      + the energized golem’s Constitution modifier.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b>
      Base creature’s CR + 2.<p><em>Aura (Su): </em>An energized golem radiates
      one of the elemental energy auras described below. All creatures within 5
      feet of the energized golem take 1d6 points of energy damage at the
      beginning of the golem’s turn. Each type of elemental aura generates an
      additional effect within this range, as is described below. For every 10
      Hit Dice the energized golem has, the range of the aura extends by 5 feet
      and it deals an additional 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of energy
      damage and any additional effects of the aura are determined by the
      elemental overcharge special quality.<p><em>Blizzard:</em> The frigid
      temperatures surrounding the energized golem deal an additional amount of
      nonlethal damage equal to the damage dice of its elemental aura to all
      creatures within range each round. A creature can attempt a Fortitude save
      to negate this additional nonlethal damage. Creatures that take any amount
      of nonlethal damage from this effect are fatigued. If a target is already
      fatigued, it is instead exhausted. The fatigued or exhaustion condition
      persists until the creature recovers from the nonlethal
      damage.<p><em>Caustic Mist:</em> A poisonous miasma emanates from the
      energized golem, afflicting those within range each round with a deadly
      toxin that rapidly destroys flesh, muscle, and organs alike. Poison (Ex):
      Aura—inhaled; save Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Str, 1
      Dex, and 1 Con damage; cure 2 saves.<p><em>Immolation:</em> The extreme
      heat surrounding the energized golem causes each creature and unattended
      object within range to catch fire unless it succeeds at a Reflex save.
      Each affected creature or item takes an additional amount of fire damage
      equal to the number of damage dice for the energized golem’s elemental
      aura immediately and each round thereafter as long as it remains within
      the aura. A creature or object that has caught on fire but moves outside
      of the aura instead takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round and can
      attempt another Reflex save each round to extinguish the
      flames.<p><em>Swirling Winds:</em> Powerful winds surround the energized
      golem, buffeting creatures within range and dealing an additional amount
      of bludgeoning damage equal to the damage dice of its elemental aura.
      These winds otherwise function as a <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=gust%20of%20wind">gust
      of wind</a> spell. An affected creature can attempt a Reflex save to
      negate this additional damage, but a successful Fortitude save is required
      to negate the <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=gust%20of%20wind">gust
      of wind</a> effect. If the energized golem has 10 or more Hit Dice, the DC
      of Fly or Strength checks to resist the effects of the winds increases by
      5.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor improves by 3.<p><b>Hit Points:</b>
      An energized golem receives double the bonus hit points based on its size
      granted by the construct creature type.<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> An
      energized golem’s body is infused with elemental energy, granting it
      immunity to a single energy type. Refer to the elemental overcharge
      special quality below.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> An energized golem
      retains all of the base creature’s special abilities and gains the
      following special attack.<p><em>Energy Discharge (Su):</em> Once per hour,
      an energized golem can discharge a pulse of energy from its body as a
      standard action, affecting all targets within a 20-foot burst. This burst
      deals 1d8 points of energy damage for every 2 Hit Dice the energized golem
      has (Reflex half ). Each creature damaged by this ability must succeed at
      a second saving throw or suffer an additional effect. The type of energy
      damage, the additional effect, and the type of save to avoid this
      additional effect are determined by the elemental overcharge special
      quality.<p><b>Ability Scores:</b> An energized golem gains ability scores
      based on the base creature’s Hit Dice and the type of elemental spirit
      used in its creation. If the elemental spirit used is an air or fire
      elemental spirit, the energized golem gains a +2 bonus to Strength and +4
      bonus to Dexterity. If the elemental spirit used is an earth or water
      elemental spirit, the energized golem gains a +4 bonus to Strength and +2
      bonus to Dexterity. If the base creature has 10 or more Hit Dice, these
      ability score bonuses increase to +8 and +4.<p><b>Special Qualities:</b>
      An energized golem retains all of the base creature’s special qualities
      and gains the following special quality.<p><em>Elemental Overcharge
      (Su):</em> An energized golem is augmented by the elemental spirit that is
      bound to it during its creation. Its natural attacks deal 1d6 points of
      energy damage for every 6 Hit Dice the golem has. The type of damage
      dealt, the golem’s immunity, and its aura are based on the elemental
      spirit bound to the golem during its creation, as listed on the table
      below.<br><br></p>
