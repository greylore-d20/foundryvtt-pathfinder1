  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You pull forth idealized versions of yourself at various ages from your
      mind, splitting into three copies of yourself. <em>Threefold form</em>
      functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.v39qnirlhgje2c0e]{bilocation}, except
      there are three of you instead of two, and each of the three bodies is
      under the effect of
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.w2yf0ksu14e91uae]{threefold aspect} with
      a different idealized age. Other than the differences from <em>threefold
      aspect</em>, each body shares all other effects with you, as normal for
      <em>bilocation</em>.</p>
