    value: >-
      <p>Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in her heritage that
      grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional class skill, and other
      special abilities. This source can represent a blood relation or an
      extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family's past. For
      example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a distant relative or her
      grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless
      of the source, this inf luence manifests in a number of ways as the
      sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her
      first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be
      changed.</p><p>At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer
      learns an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are
      in addition to the number of spells given on Table 3 – 15. These spells
      cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p><p>At 7th
      level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer receives one bonus
      feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The sorcerer must
      meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p>
