  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The eidolon’s smell or appearance is so offensive it sickens nearby
      creatures. Any living creature except its summoner that approaches within
      20 feet or begins its turn in that area is sickened for 1 round unless it
      succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s HD + its Con
      modifier). Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same
      eidolon’s sickening effect for 24 hours.</p>
