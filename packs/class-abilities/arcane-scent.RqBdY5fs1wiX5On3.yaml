    value: >-
      <p>The magus can sniff out other spellcasters. By spending 1 point from
      his arcane pool, the magus gains the scent special quality for 1 hour per
      magus level. This scent can only detect creatures capable of casting
      spells or using spell-like abilities. Additionally, while this effect
      persists, the magus can attempt a Spellcraft check as a move action to
      determine the highest level spell a detected creature is capable of
      casting (DC = 10 + the creatureâ€™s caster level). The magus can only
      attempt this Spellcraft check once per creature per 24 hours.</p>
