    value: >-
      <p>A character who makes a successful Reflex save against an area effect can
      ignore the benefits of her evasion ability to shield an adjacent ally
      against the effect, essentially halving the damage that ally would
      normally take. A character with improved evasion can attempt a secondary save
      against her allyâ€™s damage. If the save is successful, neither she nor her
      ally takes any damage. A character must have evasion in order to select this
      talent, and she must have improved evasion to benefit from the secondary
      effect.</p>
