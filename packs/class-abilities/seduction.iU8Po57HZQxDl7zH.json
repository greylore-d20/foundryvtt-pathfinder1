If the target is (or could be) sexually attracted to the witch, the save DC is increased by 2. The effect lasts for 1 round, but the witch can extend this effect for 1 additional round (up to a total number of rounds equal to her class level) by taking a standard action to continue her enthralling movements. Whether or not the target succeeds at its save, it cannot be the target of this ability again for 1 day.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the fascination effect lasts for 2 additional rounds after the witch ceases taking a standard action to maintain it. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p>"
