      <p>This barding is covered in thick metal spikes and is designed to
      protect the <em>owlbear's</em> chest, shoulders, and neck, while leaving
      the limbs mostly free for moving and attacking. It provides a +5 <em>armor
      bonus</em> to AC, reduces the <em>owlbear's</em> speed to 20 feet, and
      adds +1d8 piercing damage to its <em>grapple</em> attacks.</p>
