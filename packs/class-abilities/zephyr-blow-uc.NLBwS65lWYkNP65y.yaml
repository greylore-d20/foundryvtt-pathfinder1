  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By spending 1 ki point as a standard action, a monk with this power can
      disrupt the wind and create a sharp blast of air, as if using the spell
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.cnuin981hdq7ryit]{Gust Of Wind}. The monkâ€™s caster
      level for this effect is equal to his monk level.</p>
