      <p>A rogue with this talent can choose a trick from the ninja trick list.
      The rogue cannot choose a ninja trick with the same name as a rogue
      talent. The rogue can choose but cannot use talents that require ki
      points, unless she has a ki pool. A rogue can pick this talent more than
      once.</p>
