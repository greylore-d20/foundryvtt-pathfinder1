      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except that all creatures within the radius of a <em>symbol of
      persuasion</em> instead become charmed by the caster (as the <em>charm
      monster</em> spell) for 1 hour per caster level.</p><p>Unlike <em>symbol
      of death</em>, <em>symbol of persuasion</em> has no hit point limit; once
      triggered, a <em>symbol of persuasion</em> simply remains active for 10
      minutes per caster level.</p><p><em>Note:</em> Magic traps such as
      <em>symbol of persuasion</em> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue
      (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <em>symbol of
      persuasion</em> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25
      + spell level, or 31 for <em>symbol of persuasion</em>.</p>
