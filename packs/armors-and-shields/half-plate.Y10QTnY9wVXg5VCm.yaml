  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Half-plate armor combines elements of full plate and chainmail,
      incorporating several sizable plates of sculpted metal with an underlying
      mesh of chain links. While this suit protects vital areas with several
      layers of armor, it is not sculpted to a single individual’s frame,
      reducing its wearer’s mobility even more than a suit of full plate.
      Half-plate armor includes gauntlets and a helm.</p>
