      <p>Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures,
      causing them to stop and stare blankly at you.</p><p>In addition, you can
      use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more
      plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total HD of creatures you affect.
      Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only
      creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to
      understand you to be fascinated.</p><p>If you use this spell in combat,
      each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects
      only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a
      penalty of -2.</p><p>While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it
      reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows
      you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can
      communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after
      the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only
      with respect to that particular request.</p><p>A creature that fails its
      saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.</p>
