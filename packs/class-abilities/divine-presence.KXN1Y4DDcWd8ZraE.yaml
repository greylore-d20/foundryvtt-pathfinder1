        <p>Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even
        with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds,
        the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of
        the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the
        attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack
        the warded creature for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Those not
        attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not
        prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of
        effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but
        may use nonattack spells or otherwise act</p>

      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of divine presence for a
      number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All allies within
      this aura are treated as if under the effects of a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.yk5bgi6j9kbtigof]{sanctuary }spell with a
      DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. These
      rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is a
      standard action. If an ally leaves the area or makes an attack, the effect
      ends for that ally. If you make an attack, the effect ends for you and
      your allies.</p>
