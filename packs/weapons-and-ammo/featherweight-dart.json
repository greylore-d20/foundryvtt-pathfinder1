When you hit with a dart, the poison is injected into the target while the dart breaks off and falls away, leaving the wound hard to spot. Any amount of damage reduction, hardness, or similar protection prevents the featherweight dart from delivering its injected poison. Anyone examining the target must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to find the puncture wound, while finding the dart itself at the location where it fell requires a successful DC 15 Perception check. This ammunition can be used in both blowguns and wrist launchers. </p>"
