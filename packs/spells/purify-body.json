    "shortDescription": "<p>You align the target's chakras and soothe any unwanted imperfections found within its physical form, leaving its body pristine and without any pain or weakness.  You restore a number of hit points to the creature equal to 3d8 + 1 per caster level (maximum +20). If the healing would cause the target to exceed its maximum hit points, the target immediately gains half the excess healing from this spell as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. These temporary hit points are lost first when the target takes damage (although some temporary hit points are lost even before these temporary hit points, such as the temporary hit points from the shell of succor oracle mystery, described on page 21, or the shell of succor hex granted by the restoration spirit specialization and described on page 27).  This spell also ends any painUM effects, removes all physical ability score damage (from Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), and removes the following conditions: blinded, dazzled, deafened, nauseated, paralyzed, and sickened.</p>",
