    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, a paladin is immune to charm spells and spell-like
      abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on
      <em>saving throws</em> against charm effects.</p>

      <p>This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she
      is <em>unconscious</em> or dead.</p>
