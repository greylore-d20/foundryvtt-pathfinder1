  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The monk leaps through the air to strike a foe with a kick. Before the
      attack, the monk can move a distance equal to his fast movement bonus.
      This movement is made as part of the monkâ€™s flurry of blows attack and
      does not require an additional action. At the end of this movement, the
      monk must make an attack against an adjacent foe.</p>

      <p>This movement may be between attacks. This movement provokes an attack
      of opportunity as normal.</p>

      <p>The attack made after the movement must be a kick.</p>
