      <p>Useful primarily to those who skulk in the darkness, this spell is a
      temporary trap for the unwary. You create an immobile wall of tiny black
      blades that whirl and tear into creatures like a cyclone.</p><p>Anyone who
      enters this space takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum
      10d4), though a successful Reflex save halves the damage. The spell cannot
      be cast so that it appears in a space already occupied by Small or larger
      creatures.</p>
