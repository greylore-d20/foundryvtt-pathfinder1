      <p>The <i>black spot</i> is a specific and feared pirate curse. An
      intangible, illusory <i>black spot</i> manifests above the target's head
      and remains until the target dies or the curse is lifted. The <i>black
      spot</i> cannot be covered or hidden by any means, including other
      illusions.</p><p>The <i>black spot</i> radiates a cursed aura in a 10-foot
      radius around its target. Anyone within the aura gains a +2 bonus on
      weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. In addition, the target
      has a -4 penalty on saving throws against death effects.</p><p>Every day
      in which a creature bears a <i>black spot</i>, it must make a Fortitude
      save. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage.
      The damage cannot be healed until the <i>black spot</i> is removed. If the
      creature's Constitution reaches 0, it dies. Pirates killed by this spell
      often return as ghosts, but that is not a direct effect of this
      spell.</p><p>The <i>black spot</i> cannot be dispelled, but it can be
      removed with <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>,
      <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish</i>.</p>
