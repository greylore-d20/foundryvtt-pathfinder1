  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A synthetic adrenaline derivative once used by soldiers, hype boosts
      perception and reaction time but comes with some nasty side effects. This
      pharmaceutical has an onset time of 1 round and its effects last for 1
      hour. It provides a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks and increases
      the user's base land speed by 10 feet, but the user takes a -4 penalty on
      concentration checks and on all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based
      skill checks (with the exception of
      Perception).</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 24;
