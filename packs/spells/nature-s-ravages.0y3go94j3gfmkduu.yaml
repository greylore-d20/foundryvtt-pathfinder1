  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You greatly speed up the decomposition process of a nearby corpse and
      warp the fibers of time that permeate it, aging the corpse an additional
      amount of time equal to up to 1 day per 2 caster levels (maximum 10 days
      at 20th level). This spell prompts all the natural effects of the intended
      decomposition period, including crumbled clothing, rotted or liquefied
      flesh, maggot infestations, and the infiltration of any surrounding
      vegetation.  In addition to hindering mundane autopsies and
      investigations, this spell may effectively prohibit the use of <i>raise
      dead</i> on the target, though more powerful magic such as
      <i>resurrection</i> or true <i>resurrection</i> may still work.</p>
