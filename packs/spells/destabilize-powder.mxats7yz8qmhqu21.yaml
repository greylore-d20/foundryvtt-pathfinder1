    value: >-
      <p>This spell makes the ammunition in the target firearm is prone to
      misfire. Increase the misfire range by 1 + 1 per five caster levels
      (maximum +5) for the ammunition currently loaded into that firearm. If
      aware of this spell's effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC
      17 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect),
      the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the altered
      ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.</p>
