    "shortDescription": "<p>You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The <i>whispering wind</i> travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A <i>whispering wind</i> is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.</p><p>You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the <i>whispering wind</i> seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the <i>whispering wind</i> to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.</p><p>When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, <i>whispering wind</i> cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.</p>",
