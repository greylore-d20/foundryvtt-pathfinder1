    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>symbol of death</i>, except it is only
      activated by invisible creatures, creatures affected by an illusion
      (glamer) effect, creatures with the shapechanger subtype, or creatures
      that have magically changed their shape. These creatures are outlined by a
      pale light that functions like <i>faerie fire</i>, except it lasts for 10
      minutes per caster level; the symbol does not otherwise reveal their true
      form. Once triggered, a <i>symbol of revelation</i> remains active for 10
      minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Symbol of revelation</i> can be made
      permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 12th level or
      higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.</p>
