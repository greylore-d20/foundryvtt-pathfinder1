      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.k4whhwm1dsz2upkm]{goodberry}, except as
      noted above and that it transforms 2d4 mushrooms into magical ironbloom
      mushrooms rather than transforming common berries into magical berries.
      Alternatively, you may create twice as many mushrooms, but each only has
      the nourishment ability of a <em>goodberry</em> and not the healing
      properties.</p>
