  description:
    value: >-
      <p><strong>Category</strong> Animal Gear</p><p>This whip has small
      <em>caltrops</em> or metal barbs woven into its length and a quartet of
      metal whistles attached to the fall; when snapped, the whistle sounds like
      screaming <em>owlbear</em> young. An <em>owlbear's</em> rider uses this
      noise to enrage the monster, prodding it to attack the nearest creature.
      Anyone who attacks an <em>owlbear</em> with such a whip draws its attack
      in preference to all other targets.</p>
