      <p>The barbarian can continually replenish her health. At the start of her
      turn, she regains 1 temporary hit point for every 4 levels she has (up to
      5 hit points per round), but this cannot give her more than her maximum
      temporary hit points from rage. This is a stance rage power. A barbarian
      must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p><hr><p><span
