      <p>You create a phantasm of an oily green phantasmal poison on the target
      weapon. The first creature hit by the poisoned weapon must make a Will
      save against the illusion spell; success means the spell has no effect and
      is expended from the weapon. If the creature fails its save, it believes
      it has been poisoned and must make Fortitude saves at the spell's DC to
      avoid suffering illusory poison damage.</p><p><i>Delay poison</i> allows
      the target to ignore the effects of the phantasmal poison until the
      <i>delay poison</i> spell ends, at which time it may make a Will save to
      realize the poison is illusory and recover all illusory poison damage.
      <i>Neutralize poison</i>, <i>lesser restoration</i>, <i>or restoration</i>
      immediately recovers all damage from the spell. A successful <i>dispel
      magic</i> spell ends the effect of the illusion, as do spells that
      penetrate illusions (such as <i>true</i> seeing).</p><p>The target
      automatically recovers all illusory poison damage after 1 hour.</p>
