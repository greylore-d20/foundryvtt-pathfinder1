  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can make a single melee attack using your highest base attack bonus
      against a creature capable of casting divine spells. If you damage the
      creature, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric level
      + your Wisdom modifier) or be unable to cast any divine spells for 1
      round. If you do not damage your target with the attack, this ability is
      expended with no effect. You can use this ability a number of times per
      day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
