  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The eidolon's body becomes shadowy and more indistinct. This shadow
      form grants the eidolon constant concealment (20% miss chance), and its
      melee attacks affect incorporeal creatures as if it had the ghost touch
      weapon property. The eidolon's melee attacks deal only half damage to
      corporeal creatures.</p>
