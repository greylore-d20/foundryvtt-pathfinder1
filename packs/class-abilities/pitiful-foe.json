      "value": "<p>You can temporarily curse one target within 30 feet as a standard action, making it pitiful and ineffective in battle. While this ability is in effect, the target is never considered to be threatening you or your allies, even if it is armed and you or your allies are standing in a square into which it can make a melee attack. If the target rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw, the attack or saving throw is not an automatic success (as would be normal) and whether it is successful is instead determined normally. Additionally, the target automatically fails all rolls to confirm critical hits. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.</p>\n<p>You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 7th and 15th levels.</p>"
