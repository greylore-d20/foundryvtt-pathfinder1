For 1 minute, this weapon glows blue, pale yellow, or white and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against chaotic creatures. During this time, it’s treated as lawful for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This additional damage doesn’t stack with the additional damage from the axiomatic weapon special ability.</p>"
