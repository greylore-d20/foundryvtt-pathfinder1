  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent delivers poisons with deadly precision. When
      the rogue successfully hits an opponent with a poisoned weapon and would
      deal sneak attack damage, she can forgo the sneak attack damage and
      increase the poison’s potency. If she does, the poison’s duration
      increases by 2 (for example, large scorpion venom lasts for 8 rounds
      instead of 6 rounds, and drow poison lasts for 4 minutes instead of 2
      minutes).</p>
