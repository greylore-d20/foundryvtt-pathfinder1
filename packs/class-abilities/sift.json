      "value": "<p>At 6th level, once per day you can reach into water as a standard action and pull out an object with a maximum gp value of up to 50 gp x your class level. This object always has the broken condition upon being withdrawn from the water. The water you reach into must be at least deep enough to fully immerse yourself in. At 12th level, the objects that you retrieve are not broken. At 20th level, you can retrieve objects worth up to 5,000 gp. If you’re retrieving an object that would not normally float, assume it rests on top of or is entwined with debris that does float. Objects retrieved in this manner disappear after 24 hours if they’re not already used up or otherwise destroyed before then.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Cold Resistance power of the Water Domain.</p>"
