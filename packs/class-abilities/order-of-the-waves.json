      "value": "<p>Cavaliers of the order of the waves explore the secrets under the sea.<p><b>Edicts:</b> The cavalier must perpetually seek out and explore new places and secrets under the sea, stopping only to fight to protect his newfound treasures and his people from undersea threats (typically evil undersea races like sahuagin, but alternatively goodly or neutral enemy races for cavaliers from evil races).<p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever a cavalier of the order of the waves issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on his saving throws as long as he is underwater. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier has.<p><b>Skills:</b> A cavalier belonging to the order of the waves adds Knowledge (geography) and Perception to his class skills. He can attempt Knowledge (geography) checks untrained, but if he has ranks in the skill, he adds half his cavalier level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge (geography) checks that involve finding an underwater location.</p>"
