  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A creation of the orc smiths of Belkzen, this axe has an oversized head
      bristling with spikes and a long, thick haft that only barely
      counterbalances its weight. If your Strength is less than 19 (or 17 for a
      Small or smaller butchering axe), you take a -2 penalty on attacks with
      it, as you're unable to maneuver its daunting size and weight.</p>
