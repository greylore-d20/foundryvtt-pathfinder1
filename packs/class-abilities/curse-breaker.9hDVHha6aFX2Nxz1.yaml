      <p><b>Element</b> void; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 4;
      <b>Burn</b> 0<br><b>Prerequisite</b> emptiness</p>

      <p>The power of void protects you from curses and allows you to remove or
      suppress them. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against curses and
      hexes. You can accept 1 point of burn as a standard action to attempt a
      caster level check to remove a curse on yourself or another as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.o87h8gjxevcbztgd]{Remove Curse}. If the curse
      normally could not be removed by remove curse, you can instead suppress
      the curse until the next time your burn is removed with a successful
      caster level check.</p>

      <p>When your burn is removed, you can choose not to remove the burn you
      spent in this way to continue suppressing the curse without
      interruption.</p>

      <p>If you die, any curse suppressed in this way returns instantly.</p>
