If he already has the Whip Mastery feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat he qualified for at the level when he chose Whip Mastery.</p>\n<p>In addition, if he is at least 6th level, he also gains the Improved Whip Mastery&nbsp;feat. He treats his vigilante level as his vigilante base attack bonus for the purpose of meeting prerequisites of feats and abilities that have Whip Mastery as a prerequisite.</p>"
