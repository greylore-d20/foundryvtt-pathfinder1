  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You compel the wind to push the targets in a direction of your choice.
    The subjects can hustle during local and overland movement without risk of
    fatigue. If the subjects are flying, the first 20 feet of movement each
    round in the chosen direction does not count against their movement for the
    round. Each creature remains affected only while within 120 feet of every
    other subject. You can change the tailwind's direction once per hour by
    concentrating as a standard action. This spell has no effect underwater.</p>
