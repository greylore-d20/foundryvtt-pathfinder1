The spike reverts to its old form after 10 minutes, corroded and useless. Should a spiritbane spike rematerialize within a corporeal body, it is shunted to the nearest empty space without effect. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>\n<h3>Construction</h3>\n<p>Craft (Alchemy) DC 25</p>"
