Goods he crafts with a Craft skill he chose with social grace are worth 1/3 more gp than normal due to his celebrity, without increasing the cost to create. Whenever he uses a Profession skill he chose with social grace to make money, he makes twice as much money.</p>\n<p>A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have both the double time and social grace social talents to take this talent.</p>"
