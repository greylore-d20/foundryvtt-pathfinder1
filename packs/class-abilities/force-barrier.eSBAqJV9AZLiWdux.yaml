      <p>You create an immobile sphere or hemisphere of force around your square
      or squares. The force barrier functions as a wall of force in all other
      ways. Activating this ability is a standard action, and the barrier lasts
      until the beginning of your next turn.</p>

      <p>Each round, just before the barrier would disappear, you can extend its
      duration by accepting 1 point of burn. If an attack manages to destroy the
      force barrier, you immediately take 1 point of burn.</p>
