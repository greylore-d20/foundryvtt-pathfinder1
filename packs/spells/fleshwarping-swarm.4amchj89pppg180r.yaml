      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.vxi9c3xwa83xthka]{summon swarm}, except
      that living and undead creatures that fail their saving throw against the
      swarm's distraction find that their limbs twist and spasm, as their bodies
      become susceptible to transmutations. Such creatures take a -4 penalty to
      Dexterity and on saving throws against transmutation effects for 1 hour
      per caster level.</p>
