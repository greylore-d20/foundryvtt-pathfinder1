  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can
      irradiate any unattended object for a number of rounds equal to your
      cleric level. While an object is irradiated, it emits a faint aura of
      transmutation. Any creature that passes within 5 feet of the aura must
      succeed at a Will save (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your
      Wisdom modifier) or become sickened. You’re immune to this object’s
      effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Acid Dart power of the Earth Domain.</p>
