  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, the vampire hunter becomes the <em>bane</em> of the
      <em>undead</em>. As a <em>standard action</em>, he can make a single
      attack against his <em>undead</em> quarry at his full <em>attack
      bonus</em> while choosing one of the following effects: destroy, stake, or
      paralyze for 2d6 rounds.</p>

      <p>If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed
      at a <em>Fortitude</em> saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The
      DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the vampire hunter’s level + the vampire
      hunter’s <em>Wisdom</em> modifier. Whether or not the attack succeeds, the
      creature cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any vampire hunter)
      for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>If the vampire hunter chooses to destroy the target, the target is
      killed. If the target is a <em>vampire</em>, it does not assume
      <em>gaseous form</em>, and its <em>healing</em> powers do not come into
      effect; it is destroyed outright. If the vampire hunter chooses to stake
      his target, the target is killed if it’s a non-<em>vampire</em>. If it’s a
      <em>vampire</em> (or similar creature affected by having a stake driven
      through its heart) it is killed, but returns to life if the stake is
      removed. The vampire hunter can use his 4th-level stake ability to employ
      any piercing weapon or sharp tool as though it were a <em>wooden
      stake</em>.</p>

      <p>Additionally, at 20th level, each day when the vampire hunter regains
      his spells per day, he chooses one vampiric focus to be active on himself
      for the entire day. This focus is in addition to uses of his vampiric
      focus class ability.</p>
