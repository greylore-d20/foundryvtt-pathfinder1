  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain resistance 5 to fire. At 10th level, this resistance increases
      to 10. At 20th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition,
      whenever you are within 5 feet of a source of flame at least as large as a
      campfire, you can draw the fire around you for 1 round as a swift action.
      Anyone striking you with a melee weapon or unarmed strike takes an amount
      of fire damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). Weapons with
      reach avoid this damage.</p>
