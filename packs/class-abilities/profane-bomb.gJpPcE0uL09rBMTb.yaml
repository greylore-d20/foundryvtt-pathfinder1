  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal evil
      divine damage. Good creatures that take a direct hit from a profane bomb
      must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn.
      Against a neutral creature, a profane bomb deals half damage, and the
      target is not affected by the bombâ€™s staggering effect. A profane bomb has
      no effect against evil-aligned creatures.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level to select this
      discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
      <em>bomb</em> class feature</p>
