      <p>You gain temporary insight into your enemies' magical
      defenses.</p><p>When you next cast a spell before the end of the next
      round, treat your caster level as 5 higher than normal for the purpose of
      overcoming spell resistance. This bonus doesn't increase any other effects
      that depend on caster level, such as the spell's damage or range, and
      affects only the first spell cast after <i>sure casting</i>.</p>
