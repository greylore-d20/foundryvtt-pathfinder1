  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You push your hand into the subject, then withdraw an affliction from
      the body of the sufferer as a tangible object. This extraction appears as
      a slimy mass of flesh. The target creature is cured as if affected by
      <i>remove disease</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>neutralize poison</i>. 
      In addition, this slimy mass allows you to deliver the affliction to
      another as a touch attack, as if holding the charge for a touch spell. It
      has the same effect as the original affliction, with the same saving throw
      and DC.</p>
