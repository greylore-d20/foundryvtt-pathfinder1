  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can cause an area to become an entangling quagmire. One
      10-foot square per witch level within 90 feet becomes difficult terrain
      for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witchâ€™s Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p>If the witch uses this hex again before the duration of the previous
      use has expired, the effects of the previous use of this hex end
      immediately.</p>
