      <h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2><ul><li><strong>Ability Score

      <em>Wisdom</em> but suffer a –2 penalty to
      <em>Intelligence</em>.</li><li><strong>Type</strong>: Vine leshys are
      plants with the <em>leshy</em> subtype but lack the immunities to
      <em>mind-affecting</em> effects, <em>paralysis</em>, <em>poison</em>,
      <em>polymorph</em>, <em>sleep</em>, and stunning that the <em>plant</em>
      type usually grants, and they lack the immunity to electricity and sonic
      that the <em>leshy</em> subtype usually
      grants.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Vine leshys are Small creatures and
      gain a +1 <em>size bonus</em> to their AC, a +1 <em>size bonus</em> on
      <em>attack rolls</em>, a –1 penalty on <em>combat maneuver</em> checks and

      leshys gain a +4 <em>racial bonus</em> on <em>Stealth</em> checks in
      forests.</li><li><strong>Climber</strong>: Vine leshys gain a +2
      <em>racial bonus</em> on <em>Climb</em> checks.</li></ul><h3>Magical
      Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Pass without Trace</strong>: Vine leshys
      have @Compendium[pf1.spells.2zyr6klf97jyr5ng]{pass without trace} as a
      constant <em>spell-like ability</em> (<em>caster level</em>
      2nd).</li><li><strong>Plantspeech</strong>: Vine leshys can speak with
      vines as if subject to a continual
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.rrsefzpm3nhztvld]{speak with plants}
      spell.</li></ul><h3>Senses Racial
      Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Darkvision</strong>: Vine leshys can see in the
      dark up to 60 feet.</li><li><strong>Low-Light Vision</strong>: Vine leshys
      can see twice as far as humans under conditions of dim
      light.</li></ul><h3>Other Racial Traits</h3><ul><li><strong>Change
      Shape</strong>: Vine leshys can transform into vines, with results similar
      to @Compendium[pf1.spells.6ho3wsspkqkhypt0]{tree shape}. In this form, the
      leshy appears as a particularly healthy Small vine. The <em>leshy</em> can
      assume plant form or revert to its true form as a <em>swift
      action</em>.</li><li><strong>Verdant Burst</strong>: When slain, a vine
      leshy explodes in a burst of fertile energies. All <em>plant</em>
      creatures within 30 feet of the slain leshy regain hit 1d8 points, and
      vines quickly infest the area. If the terrain can support vines, the
      undergrowth is dense enough to make the region into difficult terrain for
      24 hours, after which the plant life diminishes to a normal level;
      otherwise, this plant life has no significant effect on movement and
      withers and dies within an hour.</li></ul>
