  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a standard action,
      the arcanist grants herself an effective illusion of armor. She gains the
      benefits of @Compendium[pf1.spells.ucc0a31d1y86oleh]{Mage Armor} with a
      caster level thatâ€™s equal to her arcanist level and appears to be wearing
      light or medium armor of whatever design she chooses when activating this
      ability. At any time while this effect is active, she can expend 1
      additional point from her arcane reservoir as an immediate action to also
      gain the benefits of @Compendium[pf1.spells.y2uhoqr4itdbw5g4]{Shield Of
      Faith} with a caster level equal to her arcanist level.</p>
