      <p>This functions as per <i>thought worm III</i>, except that the penalty
      on Will saves is -6 and a target that succeeds at its Will save still
      takes a -3 penalty on Will saves against your mind-affecting spells and
      effects for the same duration. This spell can be undercast.</p>
