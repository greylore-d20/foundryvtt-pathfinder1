A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.</p><p>The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.</p>",
