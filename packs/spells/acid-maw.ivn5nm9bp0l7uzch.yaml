  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Your animal companion's bite attack deals an additional 1d4 points of
    acid damage, and the acid deals another 1d4 points of acid damage to the
    target on the next round. The acid continues to deal damage for 1 additional
    round per 4 caster levels (to a maximum of 6 total rounds at caster level
    20th). This ongoing acid damage doesn't stack from multiple attacks, but the
    duration resets if a newer bite would cause the ongoing damage to last
    longer than the duration remaining from a previous one. The acid does not
    harm the animal companion.</p>
