      <p>With a single touch, you reduce a creature to a fumbling
      clown.</p><p>The target takes a penalty to its Dexterity equal to 1d6+1
      per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). This penalty cannot drop the
      target's Dexterity score below 1.</p><p>In addition, if the subject moves
      more than half its speed, it falls prone. If the subject flies, its
      maneuverability is reduced by one step (perfect maneuverability becomes
      good, good becomes average, and so on).</p><p>A successful Fortitude save
      halves the penalty to Dexterity and negates the possibility of falling
      prone or the reduction to fly maneuverabilities.</p>
