    value: >-
      <p>A ghostly manifestation of one of your ancestors appears before you
      bearing a weapon of your choice in its hands. The weapon may be any
      simple, martial, or dwarven weapon. It has a +1 enhancement bonus and one
      weapon special ability (your choice) from the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook</i> with a price equivalent to a +1 bonus (if the weapon is a
      double weapon, the ability and the enhancement bonus only apply to one
      end, or the weapon can have a +1 enhancement bonus on both ends but no
      other magical abilities).</p><p>You may use the weapon as if you were
      proficient in it. The weapon may not be wielded by anyone else, and if
      removed from your grasp, it vanishes and the spell ends
      immediately.</p><p>If you conjure a weapon with the flaming, frost, shock,
      or <i>thundering</i> property, this spell has the fire, cold, electricity,
      or sonic descriptor (respectively).</p>
