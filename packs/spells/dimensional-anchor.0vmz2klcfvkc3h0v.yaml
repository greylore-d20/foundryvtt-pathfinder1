  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack
      to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered
      with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional
      travel. Forms of movement barred by a <i>dimensional anchor</i> include
      <i>astral projection</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>ethereal
      jaunt</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, <i>gate</i>, <i>maze</i>, <i>plane
      shift</i>, <i>shadow walk</i>, <i>teleport</i>, and similar spell-like
      abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a <i>gate</i> or
      <i>teleportation circle</i> for the duration of the spell.</p><p>A
      <i>dimensional anchor</i> does not interfere with the movement of
      creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor
      does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also,
      <i>dimensional anchor</i> does not prevent summoned creatures from
      disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.</p>
