      <p>This crystal retort was meticulously crafted from the hides of a dozen
      shattered <em>crysmals</em>. When light is shone through the retort, the
      concoction within glows like a golden torch.</p>

      <p>A retort of control can be used to perform spontaneous alchemy with
      speed and precision. Distillation and sublimation can be carried out in
      merely 10 minutes when using this tool. In addition, if the user speaks a
      command word while using spontaneous alchemy to create an alchemical item
      with the retort as an additional crafting tool, she can designate one
      creature type or creature subtype. The created alchemical item does not
      affect creatures of the designated creature type or subtype-alchemical
      weapons do not harm such creatures on a direct hit or with <em>splash</em>
      damage, alchemical remedies do not work on such creatures, and so on.</p>
