  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You cause a <i>straitjacket</i> to spring into existence to restrain
      the target creature. You attempt a combat maneuver against the target's
      CMD. Your CMB for this check is equal to your caster level + 5 due to the
      straightjacket's Strength. This combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack
      of opportunity, and if it succeeds, the target is restrained. This is
      similar to the grappled condition, except the target is able to move at
      its normal speed, the restraint doesn't cause the target to require
      concentration checks to use abilities that require concentration, and the
      target can't take actions that require one or more hands or arms to
      perform (including casting spells that require a somatic or material
      component).  Once it has been restrained for 1 round, the target can
      attempt an additional saving throw against a magical effect that makes it
      confused, a curse, a fear effect, or a madness. The caster chooses which
      effect the target gets an extra save against. This extra save applies to
      only effects with durations of 10 minutes per level or less, and it
      doesn't apply to instantaneous effects. This extra save occurs only once
      per casting of <i>straitjacket</i>.  A creature can attempt to escape the
      <i>straitjacket</i> with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check,
      with a DC equal to 10 + your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma modifier, whichever is highest.</p>
