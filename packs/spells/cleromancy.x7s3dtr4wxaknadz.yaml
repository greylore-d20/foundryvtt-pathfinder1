      Those able to arrive at the proper interpretation are granted knowledge of
      coming events. Roll 1d4 per caster level. Group the dice by like results,
      and choose one of the groups. For the duration of <i>cleromancy</i>, you
      can apply a luck bonus equal to the result of the selected dice to any d20
      roll.</p><p>You can apply this bonus to a number of rolls equal to the
      number of dice in the group. If <i>cleromancy</i> expires before you are
