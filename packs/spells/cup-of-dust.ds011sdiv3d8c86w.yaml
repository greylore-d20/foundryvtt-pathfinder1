  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. On a failed
    saving throw, the target begins to dehydrate (see page 444 of the <i>Core
    Rulebook</i> for starvation and thirst). The effects of this spell cannot
    inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of
    drinking can counter this effect, although the target still experiences the
    other normal effects of any liquid imbibed (such as poisons or potions).
    <i>Cup of Dust</i> can be removed with a <i>break enchantment</i>,
    <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or
    <i>wish</i> spell, but effects suffered as a result of dehydration must be
    healed by normal means.</p>
