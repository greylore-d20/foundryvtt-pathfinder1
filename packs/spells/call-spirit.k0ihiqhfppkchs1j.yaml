      <p>You attempt to cause the spirit of a specific individual to manifest
      from its final resting place. You must request the spirit's presence by
      speaking its name.  Unwilling spirits can resist the summons by succeeding
      at a Will save. If the chosen spirit resists your call, another spirit
      with malevolent intent almost always takes its place, intent on deceiving
      you. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject
      and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to the creature
      whose spirit you wish to call. </p><table

      spirit manifests as a wispy, vaporous form that vaguely resembles the form
      the deceased creature had in life. The spirit has the physical attributes
      of an <i>unseen servant</i> and is capable of minor physical
      manipulations, with the ability to speak in quiet, ghostly whispers in
      whatever languages the creature knew while it was alive. The spirit isn't
      an undead creature, and isn't beholden to its caller. Whether you summoned
      the chosen spirit or a deceitful replacement, the spirit can refuse to
      answer your questions or attempt to deceive you using Bluff, though in
      either case these spirits can speak about only what they knew in life and
      have no knowledge of events that occurred after their deaths. Malevolent
      spirits might take advantage of their limited physical abilities to cause
      terrifying spectacles designed to scare the caster.  You must concentrate
      on maintaining the spell (as a standard action) in order to ask questions
      at the rate of one per round. You can ask a total of one question per
      caster level; the spirit answers each during the same round. When the
      spell ends, the spirit's ectoplasmic form fades and the soul returns to
      its rest. This spell can't call the spirits of creatures that are
      currently undead.<p></p>
