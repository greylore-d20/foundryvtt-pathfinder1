      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except that each creature within the radius of a <em>symbol of pain</em>
      instead suffers wracking <em>pain</em>s that impose a -4 penalty on attack
      rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour
      after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the
      symbol.</p><p>Unlike <em>symbol of death</em>, <em>symbol of pain</em> has
      no hit point limit; once triggered, a <em>symbol of pain</em> simply
      remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><em>Note:</em> Magic
      traps such as <em>symbol of pain</em> are hard to detect and disable. A
      rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <em>symbol of
      pain</em> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 +
      spell level, or 30 for <em>symbol of pain</em>.</p>
