  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, you become a perfect channel for life energy.
      You become immune to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea
      effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Ability damage and drain
      cannot reduce you below 1 in any ability score. You automatically make
      saving throws against massive damage. When you are below 0 hit points, you
      do not die until your negative total is in excess of twice your
      Constitution score.</p>
