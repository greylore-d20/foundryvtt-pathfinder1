  shortDescription: >-
    <p><i>Sunburst</i> causes a globe of searing radiance to explode silently
    from a point you select. All creatures in the globe are blinded and take 6d6
    points of damage. A creature to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural takes
    double damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces
    the damage by half.</p><p>An undead creature caught within the globe takes
    1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), or half damage if a
    Reflex save is successful. In addition, the burst results in the destruction
    of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its
    save.</p><p>The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to
    fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead
    creatures.</p><p><i>Sunburst</i> dispels any darkness spells of lower than
    9th level within its area.</p>
