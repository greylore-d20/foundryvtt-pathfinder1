    value: >-
      <p>Kikko armor consists of a clever arrangement of hexagonal plates made
      from iron and sewn to cloth, granting the wearer greater flexibility than
      that provided by many armors that afford similar defense. The plates may
      be left exposed or hidden by a layer of cloth.</p>
