      <p>The subject contracts an advanced form of scurvy. He becomes constantly
      fatigued, suffers from bone pain (-1 penalty on Strength-and
      Dexterity-based checks), wounds easily (add +1 point of damage to any
      bleed effects affecting the target), experiences loose teeth, and is slow
      to heal (natural healing occurs at half the normal rate). Scurvy can be
      treated magically or can be overcome with proper nutrition; eating the
      right foods ends the fatigue and bone pain within 1-2 days and provides a
      full cure 2d6 days after that.</p>
