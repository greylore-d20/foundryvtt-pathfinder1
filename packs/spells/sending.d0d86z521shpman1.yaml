  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send
      a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes
      you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature
      with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the <i>sending,</i>
      though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its
      Intelligence. Even if the <i>sending</i> is received, the subject is not
      obligated to act upon it in any manner.</p><p>If the creature in question
      is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance
      that the <i>sending</i> does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes
      may worsen this chance considerably.)</p>
