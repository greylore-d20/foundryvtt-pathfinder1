    value: >-
      <p>This spell transforms water into an alcoholic beverage, typically ale,
      beer, mead, or wine. The alcohol is of middling quality but perfectly
      drinkable. The spell also serves to remove poisons, diseases, minerals,
      and other toxins from the water as it transforms. The more contaminants
      that exist in the water, the darker the ale or the more full-bodied the
      wine becomes. The beverage's alcohol content is not affected by the
      presence or absence of contaminants.</p><p>This spell does not work on
      unholy water, potions, or other liquids with magical power.</p>
