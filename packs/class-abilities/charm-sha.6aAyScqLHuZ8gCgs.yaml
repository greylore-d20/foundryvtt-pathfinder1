    value: >-
      <p>A shaman charms an animal or humanoid creature within 30 feet by
      beckoning and speaking soothing words. This improves the attitude of an
      animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the shaman had successfully
      used the Diplomacy skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to
      the shamanâ€™s Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>

      <p>A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the
      save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again
      for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, this effect improves the attitude of the creature by 2
      steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p>
