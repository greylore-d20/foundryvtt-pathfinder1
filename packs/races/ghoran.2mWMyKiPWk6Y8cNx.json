      "value": "<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2><ul><li><b>Ability Score Modifiers</b>: +2 <em>Constitution</em>, +2 <em>Charisma</em>, –2 <em>Intelligence</em>: Ghorans are hardy, guileful, and eager to explore their emotions, but they process complex thoughts slowly.</li><li><b>Size</b>: Ghorans are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li><li><b>Type</b>: Ghorans have the <em>plant</em> type but lack the immunities to <em>mind-affecting</em>, <em>paralysis</em>, <em>poison</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>sleep</em>, and <em>stunning</em> effects that type usually has. The <em>plant</em> type features immunities that, when granted to a player character race, can be disruptive and overpowered.</li><li><b>Languages</b>: Ghorans begin play speaking Common and Sylvan. Ghorans with high <em>Intelligence</em> scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages such as Druidic).</li><li><b>Defensive Traits</b>: Ghorans have tough, rugged skin and so gain a +2 Natural Armor bonus to AC.</li></ul><h3>Special Traits</h3><ul><li><b>Natural Magic (Sp)</b>: Ghorans with a <em>Charisma</em> score of 11 or higher gain the following <em>spell-like abilities</em>: 1/day—<em>detect poison</em>, <em>goodberry</em> (created berries bud from the ghoran's own body), and <em>purify food and drink</em>. The <em>caster level</em> is equal to the ghoran's level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the ghoran's <em>Charisma</em> bonus.</li><li><b>Seed (Ex)</b>: As a <em>full-round action</em>, a ghoran can expel the seed from an orifice in its abdomen. If planted in fertile ground and left undisturbed for 2d6 days, the seed grows into a healthy duplicate of the original ghoran, save that the duplicate can reallocate all skill ranks upon sprouting. Once a ghoran expels this seed, it gains 1 <em>negative level</em>, and it dies as soon as the duplicate sprouts. This duplicate replaces the previous ghoran character.</li><li><b>Past-Life Knowledge(Ex)</b>: Ghorans have memories encoded in their seeds. They treat all <em>Knowledge</em> skills as class skills.</li></ul><h3>Weaknesses</h3><ul><li><b>Light Dependent</b>: Ghorans are heavily light dependent and so take 1d4 points of <em>Constitution damage</em> each day they go without exposure to sunlight.</li><li><b>Delicious (Ex)</b>: Ghorans take a –2 penalty on <em>Escape Artist</em> and <em>combat maneuver</em> checks to escape a <em>grapple</em> against a creature that has a bite attack with the <em>grab</em> ability.</li></ul>"
