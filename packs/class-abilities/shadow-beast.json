      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can call forth one or more beasts made of shadow by expending 1 point of mental focus. This functions as shadow conjuration, but it can be used to duplicate only the effects of summon monster spells. Creatures created with this spell deal 50% of the normal damage to those that disbelieve the illusion, and their nondamaging effects have only a 50% chance of affecting disbelieving targets. This can be used to duplicate any summon monster spell up to @Compendium[pf1.spells.hd7ukybisvv7j5r6]{Summon Monster V}.</p>\n<p>For every 2 additional levels you possess beyond 9th, the maximum spell level you can duplicate with this ability increases by 1 (to a maximum of @Compendium[pf1.spells.mi52crelhwuy6bmp]{Summon Monster IX} at 17th level). Regardless of the spell duplicated, the creatures remain for 1 round per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.</p>"
