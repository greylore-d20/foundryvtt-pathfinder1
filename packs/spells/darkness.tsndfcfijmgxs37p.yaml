  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell causes an object to radiate <i>darkness</i> out to a 20-foot
    radius. This <i>darkness</i> causes the illumination level in the area to
    drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim
    light, or from dim light to <i>darkness</i>. This spell has no effect in an
    area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity
    take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (20% miss
    chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance)
    in <i>darkness</i>.</p><p>Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of
    dim light or <i>darkness</i> without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light,
    such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of
    <i>darkness</i>. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an
    area if they are of a higher spell level than <i>darkness</i>.</p><p>If
    <i>darkness</i> is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or
    under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the
    covering is removed.</p><p>This spell does not stack with itself.
    <i>Darkness</i> can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or
    lower spell level.</p>
