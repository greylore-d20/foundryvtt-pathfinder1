  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, select a single alignment (such as lawful
      good or chaotic evil). Creatures of that alignment glow with a ghostly
      radiance while they are within your vision. Though you can see this
      radiance, other creatures cannot.  Spells and effects that obscure
      alignment, like <i>undetectable alignment</i>, also obscure the effects of
      this spell.</p>
