    value: >-
      <p>After muddling another’s account using obfuscate story, the character may
      make another opposed Diplomacy check to alter the details further in order
      to discredit, insult, or humiliate the target. If the check succeeds, the
      target takes a penalty on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against anyone
      who heard the altered story. This penalty is equal to the character’s
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus (whichever is highest), and lasts
      until the target is able to repair his reputation or discredit the rogue.
      The character must have the obfuscate story talent to select this talent.</p>
