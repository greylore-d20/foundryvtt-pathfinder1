      <p>This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to the
      object. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed
      if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of
      the pieces of an object must be present for this spell to function. Magic
      items can be repaired by this spell, but you must have a caster level
      equal to or higher than that of the object. Magic items that are destroyed
      (at 0 hit points or less) can be repaired with this spell, but this spell
      does not restore their magic abilities. This spell does not affect
      creatures (including constructs). This spell has no effect on objects that
      have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still repair damage
      done to such items.</p>
