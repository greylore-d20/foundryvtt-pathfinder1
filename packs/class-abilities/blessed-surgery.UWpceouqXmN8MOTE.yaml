  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your divine patron guides your healing hands, allowing you to perform
      minor miracles with mundane cures. You can use this ability as a free
      action when using the Heal skill in order to roll the check twice and take
      the higher result. When youâ€™re using this ability, any use of the Heal
      skill requiring 1 hour instead takes at most 1 minute. You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Rebuke Death power of the Healing Domain.</p>
