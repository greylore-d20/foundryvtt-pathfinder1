    "shortDescription": "<p>You don't so much cast a <em>miracle</em> as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.</p><p>A <em>miracle</em> can do any of the following things.</p><ul><li><p>Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.</p></li><li><p>Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.</p></li><li><p>Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as <em>feeblemind</em> or <em>insanity.</em></p></li><li>Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a <em>miracle</em> costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful <em>miracle</em>s of this sort could include the following:</p><ul><li><p>Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</p></li><li><p>Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.</p></li><li>Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</li></ul><p>In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.</p><p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a <em>miracle</em> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.</p>"
