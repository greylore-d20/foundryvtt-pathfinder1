      touch</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A vortex gun looks like a sleek shotgun
      with three barrels arranged in a triangular formation. When this weapon is
      fired, the three barrels release a beam of gravitons that spiral around
      each other to create a 100-foot-long cone-shaped vortex of devastating
      energy. This energy tears, crushes, and twists everything in its path.
      Being struck by a vortex gun induces overwhelming vertigo in living
      victims. A living creature damaged by a vortex gun must succeed at a DC 18
      Fortitude saving throw to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. A critical
      hit also allows the user of the gun to attempt a trip combat maneuver
      check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 15); this
      attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Flying creatures struck by
      a vortex gun are affected as if they were struck by hurricane force winds.
      A creature protected by a force field takes no damage from a vortex gun
      but must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or the shot automatically depletes
      all of the force field's remaining hit
      points.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 33;
