    value: >-
      <p>The transmuted creatures can tread on any liquid as if it were firm
      ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can
      be traversed easily, since the subjects' feet hover an inch or two above
      the surface. Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the
      heat because they are near it. The subjects can walk, run, charge, or
      otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.</p><p>If
      the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or
      wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in), the subjects are borne
      toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.</p>
