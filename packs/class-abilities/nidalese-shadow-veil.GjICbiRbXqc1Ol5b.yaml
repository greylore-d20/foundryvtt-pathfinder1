  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, an arcanist can pull a
      veil of shadows around her, making her more difficult to spot and strike.
      The arcanist gains concealment (20% miss chance) and a +5 bonus on Stealth
      checks. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to 1 + the arcanistâ€™s
      Charisma bonus.</p>
