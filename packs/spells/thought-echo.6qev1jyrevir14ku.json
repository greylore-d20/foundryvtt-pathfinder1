    "shortDescription": "<p>When you cast this spell, you establish a mental echo of up to 25 words. Any attempt to read the surface thoughts of the target creature reads only this mental echo unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + your caster level). If you cast <i>thought echo</i> on yourself, the DC is instead equal to 15 + your caster level. In addition, when casting this spell upon yourself, you can change the echoed thoughts by taking a standard action and concentrating.  Each time you change the words echoed by the spell in this way, you reduce the spell's remaining duration by 1 minute. <i>Thought echo</i> d oes n ot i nterfere w ith t elepathy o r m ind reading effects that are capable of reaching thoughts deeper than surface thoughts.</p>"
