      <p>The momentum of your kinetic blast knocks foes back. Attempt a bull
      rush combat maneuver check against each target damaged by your infused
      blast, using your Constitution modifier instead of your Strength modifier
      to determine your bonus. This infusion can push a foe back by a maximum of
      5 feet. You can increase the burn cost of this infusion to increase the
      maximum distance pushed by 5 feet per additional point of burn accepted.
      You canâ€™t use this infusion with a form infusion such as cloud that causes
      your kinetic blast to lack a clear direction to push.</p>
