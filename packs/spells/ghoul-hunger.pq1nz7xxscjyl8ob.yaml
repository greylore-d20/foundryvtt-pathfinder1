  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You awaken an unnatural hunger in the target, compelling it to fall
      upon a nearby helpless or dead humanoid creature and begin eating its
      flesh. The target defends itself normally but takes no other actions while
      eating. The target does not take extraordinary risks to satisfy this urge
      (it wouldn't jump over a pit or swim through lava to reach a suitable
      victim). If the target can't fulfill this urge on its next turn, the spell
      fails. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw
      to end the effect.</p>
