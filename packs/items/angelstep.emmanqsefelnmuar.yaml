      <p>This iridescent white shelf fungus is said to have first grown from the
      footsteps of an <em>angel</em>, though some claim it instead comes from
      the footsteps of a <em>djinni</em>.</p>

      <p><b>Gather</b> DC 18; <b>Yield</b> 1 dose</p>

      <p><b>Terrain</b> temperate or warm deserts</p>

      <p><b>Preparation</b> A dose of angelstep can be used raw or processed
      into a pigment that can be worn on the skin. Processing a dose of the
      pigment takes 4 hours and requires a successful DC 15 <em>Craft</em>
      (alchemy) check. Angelstep pigment costs twice as much as the raw
      fungus.</p>

      <p><b>Use</b> As part of an attempt to <em>stabilize</em> a <em>dying</em>
      creature, a dose of raw angelstep can be rubbed on the creature to grant a
      +4 bonus on the <em>Heal</em> check to <em>stabilize</em> the creature. A
      dose of angelstep pigment applied to the skin of a Medium or smaller
      creature helps to protect that creature against death for 2d4 hours. The
      next time the wearer of angelstep pigment drops to negative <em>hit
      points</em>, it gains a +4 <em>alchemical bonus</em> on its next 1d6
      <em>Constitution</em> checks to <em>stabilize</em>. The pigment loses its
      effect once all these checks are attempted or once the victim is
      stabilized.</p>
