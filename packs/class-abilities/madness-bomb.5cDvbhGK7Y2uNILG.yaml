    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist's bombs do more than sear fleshâ€”they sear the mind. A
      creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the
      bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage
      dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points
      of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom
      damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that
      hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom
      damage.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
