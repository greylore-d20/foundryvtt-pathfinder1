      "value": "<p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a grease slick upon detonation. When a grease bomb detonates, it coats an area equal to the bomb’s splash radius in grease (as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.ik9u3eel5vfwrtb5]{Grease} spell) for 1 round per level. The DC of the Reflex save to avoid falling after a failed Acrobatics check is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. A grease bomb can’t affect items or armor.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
