It can hold up to 2 gallons of freshwater or saltwater, allowing it to house aquatic creatures such as fish or frogs. The cap near the top of the ball can be unscrewed for access. One Tiny creature or two Diminutive creatures can fit comfortably into an aquarium ball. The water within the orb must be changed daily in order to keep the creatures within alive. Otherwise, the inhabitants begin to slowly suffocate.</p>"
