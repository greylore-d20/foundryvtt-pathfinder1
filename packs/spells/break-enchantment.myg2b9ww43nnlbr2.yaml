  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses.
    <i>Break enchantment</i> can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each
    such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum
    +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the
    creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item,
    the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.</p><p>If the spell is one that
    cannot be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>stone to flesh</i>,
    <i>break enchantment</i> works only if that spell is 5th level or
    lower.</p><p>If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, <i>break
    enchantment</i> does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free
    the victim from the item's effects.</p>
