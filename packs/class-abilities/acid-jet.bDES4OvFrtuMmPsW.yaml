  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can unleash a jet of acid by expending 1 point from her
      arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target
      within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 points of acid damage +
      the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points of acid
      damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level).
      The target is also sickened for 1d4 rounds. It can attempt a Fortitude
      saving throw to negate the sickened condition.</p>
