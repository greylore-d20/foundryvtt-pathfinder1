  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You ward an area's shadows such that light cannot penetrate them. The
      illumination level in the affected area no longer changes when nonmagical
      light enters it. Any magical effect must succeed at a caster level check
      (DC = 10 + your caster level) in order to change the light level within
      the spell's radius. <i>Darkvault</i> has no effect on spells or effects
      that would make the spell's area darker.  The spell must be cast on an
      area, such as a cave or room. A spellcaster of 11th level or higher can
      make <i>darkvault</i> permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell, at a cost
      of 7,500 gp.</p>
