      "value": "<p>As your self-awareness expands, you become increasingly attuned to the spirit world around you. At 5th level, as part of your meditation to initiate metamorphosis, you can invite a wandering spirit to share your body as if you were a shaman (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 37). You gain the associated 1st-level spirit ability as long as you maintain your altered form, but your metamorphosis form also exhibits some aspect of the spirit you host, such as vivid red hair for a flame spirit or gauntness for a bone spirit.</p>"
