  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical
      auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <i>detect
      magic</i> spell, but <i>arcane sight</i> does not require concentration
      and discerns aura location and power more quickly.</p><p>You know the
      location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power
      depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted
      in the description of the <i>detect magic</i> spell. If the items or
      creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft
      skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one
      check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a
      nonspell effect.) If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120
      feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any
      spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine
      (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most
      powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available
      for use.</p><p>As with <i>detect magic</i>, you can use this spell to
      identify the properties of magic items, but not artifacts.</p><p><i>Arcane
      sight</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
