  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian can focus her ferocity. She gains a +1 bonus on melee
      damage rolls and thrown weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for
      every 4 levels the barbarian has.</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>

      <p>Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A barbarian can’t have
      more than one stance rage power active at a time. If she activates a
      stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance
      immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning
      of the barbarian’s turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the
      rage ends.</p>
