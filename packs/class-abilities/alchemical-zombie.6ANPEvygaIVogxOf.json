This process takes 1 hour and costs 100 gp in alchemical reagents per HD of the corpse being animated; the dead creature gains the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Human%20Zombie\">zombie template</a>. Zombies that are created in this manner count as undead created by @Compendium[pf1.spells.8uwmrygxgih1fb57]{Animate Dead} for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery. The created zombie is a creature, not a supernatural effect.</p>"
