  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You turn one type of golem into another. The golem must be willing-it
    must be commanded to transform by its master or must be a creature able to
    make informed decisions that opts to submit to the spell. You must provide
    various powdered metals with a value equal to 150% of the difference in
    creation costs between the old and new type of golem, even if the new golem
    type is cheaper to create. Both types of golems must share the same
    subtypes, if any. You cannot transmute a golem into a new type of golem with
    a CR higher than your caster level.  If all of these conditions are
    satisfied, the old golem completely changes to the new golem type. Its
    abilities and statistics are identical to one of the new golem type,
    including its magic immunities and special attacks. The new golem is still
    affected by any damage or conditions it suffered before the spell was
    cast.</p>
