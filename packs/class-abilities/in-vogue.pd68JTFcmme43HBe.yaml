  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilanteâ€™s crafting or professional business is always at the
      height of the local trends, allowing the vigilante to gain more profits
      than usual. Goods he crafts with a Craft skill he chose with social grace
      are worth 1/3 more gp than normal due to his celebrity, without increasing
      the cost to create. Whenever he uses a Profession skill he chose with
      social grace to make money, he makes twice as much money.</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have both the double time
      and social grace social talents to take this talent.</p>
