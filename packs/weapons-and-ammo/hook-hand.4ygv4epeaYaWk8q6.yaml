  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Pirates who lose a hand in the course of their adventures sometimes
      attach hooks to their wrists. Hook hands can't be disarmed. They generally
      don't interfere with day-to-day activities, but can't be used for tasks
      that would require an actual hand (such as completing somatic components,
      drawing arrows, or holding a weapon with both hands).</p>
