  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A stingchuck is a foul bag made of a humanoid's head with the brain
      removed and the skull heavily scored so that it bursts open when thrown.
      Normally filled with biting vermin, it acts as a splash weapon. When it
      hits, the vermin bite and sting the target, dealing 1d6 points of damage
      and forcing a DC 11 Fortitude save to avoid being nauseated for 1d3
      rounds. Each round a creature remains nauseated by a stingchuck, it takes
      1 additional point of damage from the biting vermin. All creatures within
      the splash effect take 1 point of damage from the vermin but do not risk
      being nauseated.</p>
