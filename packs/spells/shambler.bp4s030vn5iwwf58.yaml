  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The <i>shambler</i> spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the
    advanced template (see the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>). The creatures
    willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve
    as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for 7 days unless you dismiss
    them. If the <i>shambler</i>s are created only for guard duty, however, the
    duration of the spell is 7 months. In this case, the <i>shambler</i>s can
    only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to
    guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the
    point where each first appeared. You can only have one <i>shambler</i> spell
    in at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in
    effect, the previous casting is dispelled. The <i>shambler</i>s have
    resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain where
    they are summoned is rainy, marshy, or damp.</p>
