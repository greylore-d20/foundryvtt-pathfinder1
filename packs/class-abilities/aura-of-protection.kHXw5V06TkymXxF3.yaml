      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of protection for a number of
      rounds per day equal to your cleric level. You and your allies within this
      aura gain a +1 deflection bonus to AC and resistance 5 against all
      elements (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic). The deflection bonus
      increases by +1 for every four cleric levels you possess beyond 8th. At
      14th level, the resistance against all elements increases to 10. These
      rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
