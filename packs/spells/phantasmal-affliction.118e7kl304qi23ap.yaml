      <p>You cause the creature to believe she has a debilitating affliction.
      The target can attempt a Will save to recognize the affliction as unreal.
      If that save fails, the creature suffers an imaginary affliction of your
      choice.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Curse</strong>: The target believes she has
      been cursed. She takes a permanent –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves,
      ability checks, and skill checks for 1 hour per caster level. After her
      save to disbelieve, the target attempts a second Will save to negate this
      effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>Poison</strong>: The target believes she
      has been poisoned. Choose a physical ability score. Each round for 6
      rounds, plus 1 round per 5 caster levels, the target takes 1d3 points of
      damage to the chosen ability score. Each turn, the creature can attempt a
      Fortitude save to negate the damage and end the ongoing
      damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wasting</strong>: The target believes she
      has contracted a wasting disease. Each day, the creature takes 1d4 points
      of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued. A successful Fortitude save
      prevents this damage. Two consecutive successful saves end the
      effect.</p></li></ul><p>Since the affliction exists entirely in the
      creature’s mind, phantasmal affliction is not affected by normal cures
      like neutralize poison or remove disease, or other effects like delay
      poison or the Heal skill. Ordinary immunities do not apply in this case
      (though a creature immune to the affliction receives a +4 bonus on the
      Will save to disbelieve the illusion). Constitution damage from the
      affliction can’t kill the target. Instead, it causes the target to fall
      unconscious like other forms of ability damage. Phantasmal affliction is a
      spell effect and can be dispelled
      normally.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.0wahvj06h5eak2fk]{Placebo
