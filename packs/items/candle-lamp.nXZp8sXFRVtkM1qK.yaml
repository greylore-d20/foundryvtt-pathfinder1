      <p>A candle lamp is a small lanternlike device with glass panels and a
      slot to hold a candle. It protects the candle from drafts and catches wax
      drippings. It provides the same light as a candle, but can be shuttered
      such that it only illuminates 1 to 3 adjacent squares. You can use a
      candle lamp to keep your hands warm.</p>
