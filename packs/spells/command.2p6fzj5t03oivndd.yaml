  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its
    ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following
    options.</p><p><i>Approach</i>: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as
    quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing
    but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this
    movement as normal.</p><p><i>Drop</i>: On its turn, the subject drops
    whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next
    turn.</p><p><i>Fall</i>: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and
    remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any
    appropriate penalties.</p><p><i>Flee</i>: On its turn, the subject moves
    away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move
    during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as
    normal.</p><p><i>Halt</i>: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may
    not take any actions but is not considered helpless.</p><p>If the subject
    can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically
    fails.</p>
