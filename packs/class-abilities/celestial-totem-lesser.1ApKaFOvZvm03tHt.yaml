  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian benefits from increased magical healing.
      Whenever she is subject to a spell that cures hit point damage, she heals
      1 additional point of damage per caster level. In the case of non-spell
      healing effects (such as channeled energy or lay on hands), she heals a
      number of additional points equal to the class level of the character
      performing the magical healing. This does not affect fast healing or
      regeneration.</p>
