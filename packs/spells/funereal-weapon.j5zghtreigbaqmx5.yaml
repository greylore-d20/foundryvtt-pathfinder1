  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You imbue a weapon with a faint silvery glow that dimly illuminates a
    5-foot square. An affected weapon also easily bypasses the physical defenses
    of undead creatures, ignoring 5 points of an undead creature's damage
    reduction, as long as the damage reduction is not DR/epic. For example,
    attacks with a weapon affected by this spell completely ignore a zombie's DR
    5/slashing or reduce a lich's damage reduction to DR 10/bludgeoning and
    magic.  You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed
    strike. <i>Funereal weapon</i> affects the DR of only undead creatures.</p>
