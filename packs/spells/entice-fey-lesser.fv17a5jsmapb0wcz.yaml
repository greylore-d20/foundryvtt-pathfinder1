    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.c3vws58yy0pk47gs]{lesser planar ally},
      except that you entice a fey of 6 HD or fewer to lend you its aid with an
      offering of music or something else it finds appealing. Like <em>lesser
      planar ally</em>, this spell is unpredictable, and the fey who answers the
      calling is up to the whims of nature and the fey, not your own choice. You
      must succeed at a Knowledge (nature) check or Perform check (DC = 20 +
      target's HD) in addition to the spell's material component to entice the
      fey into appearing, after which you can negotiate for the service and your
      payment. The maximum HD of fey that you can call with that casting is
      equal to the result of your check - 20. For example, if your check result
      is a 24, the maximum HD for the called fey is 4. A high result doesn't
      allow you to break the HD maximum for the spell, and a result of 20 or
      less means you can't call a fey at all. If the fey doesn't like the sound
      of your offer, it can simply choose to refuse, in which case you don't
      expend any of the material components for the spell, either the offerings
      or the payment.</p>
