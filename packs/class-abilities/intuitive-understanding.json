In addition, while under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist may use&nbsp;augury&nbsp;once as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to his alchemist level). At 10th level, he can use&nbsp;divination&nbsp;instead.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level and must have the cognatogen discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>"
