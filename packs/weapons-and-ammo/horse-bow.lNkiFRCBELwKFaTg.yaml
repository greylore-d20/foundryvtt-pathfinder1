  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The horse bow functions like a composite longbow, but it is designed to
      be used on horseback. A rider using a horse bow can make ranged attacks
      while mounted; furthermore, she does not take a penalty to attack rolls
      when her mount is taking a double move action, and she takes only a -4
      penalty on attack rolls when her mount is running. The price of this item
      is for a default horse bow; each point of Strength bonus granted by the
      horse bow adds 150 gp to its cost.</p>
