    value: >-
      <p>A slayer with this talent may move through any sort of undergrowth
      (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at
      his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other
      impairment. Terrain that is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede
      motion still affects the slayer as normal.</p>
