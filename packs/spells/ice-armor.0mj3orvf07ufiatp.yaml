  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a suit of armor made of ice. While cold to the touch, it
      does not harm the wearer, especially if worn over normal clothing (though
      it can hasten the effects of exposure in cold environments). It offers the
      same protection as a breastplate, except it has hardness 0 and 30 hit
      points. If the intended wearer is immersed in water when you cast this
      spell, you may form the armor around the wearer (who may be you);
      otherwise the wearer must don the armor normally. Attacks against the
      wearer that create heat or fire degrade the armor, reducing its armor
      bonus by 1 for every 5 points of fire damage the wearer takes; when the
      armor's bonus to AC reaches 0, the armor is destroyed and the spell ends.
      Because the ice is slightly buoyant, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance
      bonus on Swim checks, except when swimming downward. Druids can wear
      <i>ice armor</i> without penalty.</p>
