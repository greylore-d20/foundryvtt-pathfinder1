This ability functions similarly to the investigator’s inspiration ability, but the vigilante’s inspiration pool is equal to his class level (do not add his Intelligence modifier), the vigilante can never use this ability without expending a use of inspiration, and it doesn’t count as inspiration for any effects that interact with or require the inspiration class feature.</p>"
