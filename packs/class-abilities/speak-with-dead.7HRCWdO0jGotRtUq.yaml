  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, as a standard action, you can ask one question of a dead
      creature as if using @Compendium[pf1.spells.byn5q46du0ck592a]{Speak with
      Dead}. The dead creature you are questioning does not gain a Will saving
      throw if your alignments are different. You can use this ability a number
      of times per day equal to your cleric level.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Ward Against Death power of the Repose
      Domain.</p>
