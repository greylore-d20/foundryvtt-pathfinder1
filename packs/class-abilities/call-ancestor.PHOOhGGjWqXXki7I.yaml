  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, once per day, you can spend a <em>standard action</em> to
      grant a long-dead relative a brief facsimile of life. This functions as
      the @Compendium[pf1.spells.wy8c3at9nrhjfavm]{Simulacrum, Lesser} spell,
      except the <em>simulacrum</em> lasts only 1 round per <em>sorcerer</em>
      level you have, has the same statistics as you, and always has the
      likeness of an ancestor. In addition, the <em>simulacrum</em> has lost
      knowledge from the past. When <em>summoning</em> the <em>simulacrum</em>,
      select one <em>Knowledge</em> skill. The <em>simulacrum</em> is considered
      trained in that skill and has a bonus on <em>Knowledge</em> checks of this
      type equal to twice your level plus your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.
      The <em>simulacrum</em> is under your control, but it cannot attack or
      take hostile actions. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per
      day. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day. You
      cannot have more than one ancestor <em>simulacrum</em> active at any one
      time.</p>
