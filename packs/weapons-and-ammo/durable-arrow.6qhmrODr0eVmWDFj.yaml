      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>These arrows are tightly wrapped in strands of alchemical glue. Durable
      arrows don't break with normal use, whether or not they hit their target;
      unless a durable arrow goes missing, an archer can retrieve and reuse it
      again and again.</p>

      <p>Durable arrows can be broken in other ways (such as deliberatenapping,
      hitting a fire elemental, and so on).</p>

      <p>A magical durable arrow with an enhancement bonus or magic weapon
      special ability applies these magical effects only the first time it is
      used-afterward, the durable arrow becomes nonmagical, and it can be reused
      or imbued with magic again.</p>
