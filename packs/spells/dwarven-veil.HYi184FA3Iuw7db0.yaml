      <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> In order to prepare this spell, the caster must
      spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches <b>Bolka</b>.
      Further details can be found in <em>Pathfinder Companion: Dwarves of
      Golarion.</em></p><p>This spell enhances the targetâ€™s dwarven or
      dwarf-like qualities, making it appear more attractive, personable, and
      worthy of respect and admiration by dwarves. The target is still
      recognizable as itself. The target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to checks
      to influence dwarves (such as Diplomacy, Intimidate, and so on).</p>
