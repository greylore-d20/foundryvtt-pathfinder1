      <p><b>Element</b> air; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 6;
      <b>Burn</b> 0<br><b>Prerequisite</b> engulfing winds</p>

      <p>You can call forth mighty winds in an enormous area. As a standard
      action, you can alter the wind around you as if using
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g9koefk7x9szoheo]{Control Winds}, but the change
      remains only for as long as you continue to take a standard action to
      concentrate on this effect.</p>

      <p>If you accept 1 point of burn, you can extend the duration to 10
      minutes per kineticist level you possess without your needing to
      concentrate.</p>
