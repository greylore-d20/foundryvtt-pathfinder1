      <p>Even a broken object remembers what it means to be a functioning whole.
      You restore a broken object or damaged construct to a functional state, as
      if it were new and intact.</p><p>Any pieces missing from the object or
      construct remain missing. Significant missing pieces may prevent proper
      functioning. If the object uses charges, the object becomes fully charged.
      A timeworn object becomes fully charged, but doesn't lose the timeworn
      condition (this spell is one of the few ways a timeworn item can be
      recharged). For 1 hour after this spell is cast on a timeworn object, that
      object does not suffer any chance of glitching. Other consumables such as
      ammunition are not restored.</p><p>When this spell is cast upon a damaged
      construct, all hit point damage dealt to that construct is healed. When
      this spell is cast upon a destroyed construct, it is restored to full
      functionality and full hit points, provided no significant portion of the
      destroyed construct (such as an entire limb) is missing. Constructs
      brought back in this fashion regain their memories up to the moment of
      their destruction and have no particular inclination to serve the
      caster.</p><p>If you attempt to cast this spell on an object or a
      construct that has been destroyed for more than 10 years per caster level
      you possess, the spell fails.</p>
