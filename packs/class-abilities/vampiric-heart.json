      "value": "<p>The vampire hunter gains&nbsp;<em>energy resistance</em>&nbsp;equal to half his level against cold and electricity. Additionally, the vampire hunterâ€™s heartbeat is undetectable. Any ability that detects or identifies the living, such as the&nbsp;<em>lifesense</em>&nbsp;ability, does not perceive him. At 16th level, once per day when reduced to 0 or fewer&nbsp;<em>hit points</em>&nbsp;while this focus is activated, the vampire hunter immediately turns gaseous (as the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous Form}) for up to a number of rounds equal to half his level and he gains a number of&nbsp;<em>temporary hit points</em>&nbsp;equal to half his level. The vampire hunter can leave&nbsp;<em>gaseous form</em>&nbsp;at any time without losing these&nbsp;<em>temporary hit points</em>. This effect ends after these rounds have elapsed, after the vampire hunter loses the&nbsp;<em>temporary hit points</em>, or once this focus is no longer active, at which point the vampire hunter immediately becomes corporeal and loses these&nbsp;<em>temporary hit points</em>. If he has not received&nbsp;<em>healing</em>&nbsp;in the interim, this returns the vampire hunter to the number of&nbsp;<em>hit points</em>&nbsp;he had after the attack or effect that triggered this ability.</p>"
