    value: >-
      <p><em>You can make additional attacks of
      opportunity.</em></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You may make a number
      of additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to your Dexterity
      bonus. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while
      flat-footed.</p><p><strong>Normal</strong>: A character without this feat
      can make only one attack of opportunity per round and can't make attacks
      of opportunity while flat-footed.</p><p><strong>Special</strong>: The
      Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability
      more than once per round.</p><h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>When you miss with an
      attack of opportunity, you can spend 5 stamina points to make a second
      attack for the same provoking action. That second attack of opportunity
      takes a -5 penalty on the attack roll and costs one of your attacks of
      opportunity for the round.</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: Spend 1 charge
      after use. Charges tracks total AoOs.</p>
