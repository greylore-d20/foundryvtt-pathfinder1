      <p>At 8th level, you can assume a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{gaseous form} (as per the
      spell of that name) as a swift action for a number of minutes per day
      equal to your wizard level. This duration does not need to be consecutive,
      but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
