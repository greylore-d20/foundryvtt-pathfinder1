      <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that all
      creatures within the radius of a <i>Symbol of Distraction</i> instead
      become fascinated by the symbol for 10 minutes per caster level. Unlike
      <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>Symbol of Distraction</i> has no hit point
      limit; once triggered, a <i>Symbol of Distraction</i> simply remains
      active for a duration of 10 minutes x your caster level. All fascinated
      creatures move toward the <i>Symbol of Distraction</i>, trying to remain
      within the symbol's area of effect. If the symbol leads affected creatures
      into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature can attempt an additional
      Will saving throw, with success indicating it is no longer fascinated. If
      a creature's view of the symbol is completely blocked, it is immediately
      freed of the symbol's effect.</p>
