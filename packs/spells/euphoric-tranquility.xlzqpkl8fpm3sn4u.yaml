    value: >-
      <p>A creature under the effect of this enchantment enters a state of
      euphoria. The target treats all creatures as dear friends and abhors
      violence, but may rise up to protect itself if violence is perpetrated
      against it. Until the end of the spell's duration, the creature's speed is
      halved, and it cannot make attacks or cast spells. If the creature is
      attacked, it gets a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the
      creature can make act normally for 1 round. If the saving throw fails, the
      creature moves half its speed away from the attacker as its next
      action.</p><p>Furthermore, if the creature is interacted with, or
      questioned while under the effects of this spell, it is considered to have
      an attitude of Helpful (see the Diplomacy skill, <i>Core Rulebook</i> 94),
      though any advice or answers it gives may be disjointed or stream of
      consciousness due to its euphoric state.</p>
