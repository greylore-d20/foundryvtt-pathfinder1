  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Smoke bullets require only a successful touch attack to release the
      smoke. When they strike a target, they burst, releasing a cloud of noxious
      gas that requires the creature struck to attempt a DC 13
      <em>Fortitude</em> save. If the save fails, the target is nauseated for 2
      rounds.</p>
