Compact spellbooks hold only 70 pages of spells, but they weigh significantly less than an ordinary spellbook. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>\r\n<p><b>Traveling Spellbook</b> A traveling spellbook is lighter and less cumbersome than its full-size counterpart. It has 50 pages. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO9410</em></p>\r\n<p>Spellbook Extras</p>\r\n<p><b>Book Lariat</b> This braided metal cord comes with a clasp that affixes to the lock of a standard <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/books-paper-writing-supplies#TOC-Spellbook\">spellbook</a>.

If you drop your <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/books-paper-writing-supplies#TOC-Spellbook\">spellbook</a> while it's attached to the lariat, you can recover the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/books-paper-writing-supplies#TOC-Spellbook\">spellbook</a> as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. While attached to you, the book can never be farther than 10 feet from you. Unclasping the book requires a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>, or the cord can be cut to free the book (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a> 5, hp 10). <b>Price</b> 3 sp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1129</em></p>\r\n"
