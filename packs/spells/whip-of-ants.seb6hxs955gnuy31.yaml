  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>Whip of Spiders</i>, except it summons army
      ants, and any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if
      it were attacked by an army ant swarm (3d6 points of damage plus poison
      and distraction, <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 16). If you transform the
      whip into an army ant swarm, it has 16 hit points.</p>
