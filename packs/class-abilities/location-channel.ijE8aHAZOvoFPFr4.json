      "value": "<p>At 5th level, a medium can perform a special seance at the site of a person’s death—or a location that was precious to that person in life—to call forth that person’s spirit into the medium’s body so his allies can ask it questions. The effects are similar to the spell call spirit (see page 160), except that the duration is 1 round per medium level and the spirit possesses the medium’s body instead of appearing in a wispy form. The other participants of the seance must ask the questions.</p>\n<p>Once the medium attempts to call a spirit, he cannot attempt to call the same spirit again for 24 hours. Once per round, the medium can attempt to end the seance early by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 the medium’s class level).</p>"
