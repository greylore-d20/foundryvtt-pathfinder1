The DC to decipher a message encoded with a cypher you invent is equal to the result of the Linguistics check you roll when creating the cypher. You can instead use one of the dozen example cyphers in the book, in which case the DC to understand the message without the cypher is 25, and any characters attempting to decipher the message do so automatically if they consult a copy of the same book.</p>"
