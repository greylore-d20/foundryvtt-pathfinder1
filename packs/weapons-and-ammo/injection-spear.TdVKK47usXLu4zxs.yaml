  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This exotic two-handed weapon allows the user to inject targets with
      liquid on a hit. The spear's reservoir can hold up to 5 doses of a single
      fluid-a single dose is automatically injected when the spear hits a
      target. A non-proficient user can wield an injection spear as a standard
      spear but cannot trigger the injection. An injection spear is otherwise
      identical to a normal spear, save that it cannot be thrown, weighs 8
      pounds, cannot be used to brace, and costs 60 gp.</p>
