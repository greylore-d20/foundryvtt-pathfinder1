  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving
      its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease
      changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. The target
      gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a -2 size penalty to Strength (to a
      minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its
      <i>reduced</i> size.</p><p>A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases
      to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning
      that it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid
      creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a
      natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's
      speed.</p><p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly
      <i>reduced</i> by the spell.</p><p>Melee and projectile weapons deal less
      damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any
      <i>reduced</i> item that leaves the <i>reduced</i> creature's possession
      (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal
      size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles
      deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired
      them).</p><p>Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack.
      <i>Reduce person</i> counters and dispels <i>enlarge
      person</i>.</p><p><i>Reduce person</i> can be made permanent with a
      <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
