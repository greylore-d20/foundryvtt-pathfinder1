  shortDescription: >-
    <p>With a single touch, you reduce a creature to a fumbling clown.</p><p>The
    target takes a penalty to its Dexterity equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels
    (maximum 1d6+5). This penalty cannot drop the target's Dexterity score below
    1.</p><p>In addition, if the subject moves more than half its speed, it
    falls prone. If the subject flies, its maneuverability is reduced by one
    step (perfect maneuverability becomes good, good becomes average, and so
    on).</p><p>A successful Fortitude save halves the penalty to Dexterity and
    negates the possibility of falling prone or the reduction to fly
    maneuverabilities.</p>
