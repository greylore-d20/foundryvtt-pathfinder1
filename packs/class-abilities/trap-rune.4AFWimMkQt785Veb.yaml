    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, as a <em>standard action</em>, you can sketch a single,
      nearly <em>invisible</em> magical rune on any 5-foot-square solid surface.
      When you create a rune, pick one of the following energy types: acid,
      cold, electricity, or fire. While the rune is active, the next creature
      other than you who steps on or touches the rune’s area causes the rune to
      explode. The rune’s explosion deals a number of points of energy damage
      equal to 1d8 + 1 per <em>sorcerer</em> level you possess to anything in
      its square. A <em>Reflex</em> saving throw halves the damage (DC 10 + 1/2
      your <em>sorcerer</em> level + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier). The rune
      is considered a magical trap for the purpose of perceiving it or disabling
      it. The DC for both <em>Perception</em> and <em>Disable Device</em> checks
      is the same as the <em>Reflex</em> saving throw to halve the damage. You
      can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Charisma</em> modifier. Each rune lasts for 24 hours or until
      discharged.</p>
