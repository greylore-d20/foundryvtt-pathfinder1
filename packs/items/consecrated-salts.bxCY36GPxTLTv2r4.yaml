  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The powdered salts in this stoppered glass sphere contains reagents
      blessed by a cleric or another divine authority. You can throw a sphere of
      consecrated salts as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet.
      Consecrated salts deal damage to evil outsiders, haunts, and undead as if
      they were a flask of
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.CmjSKOVJuQnV8o3S]{holy water}.
      Additionally, if a haunt or rejuvenating undead such as a ghost is reduced
      to 0 hp within 1 minute of being damaged by consecrated salts, its reset
      time (in the case of a haunt) or rejuvenation is delayed by 1 day. This
      delay can also be achieved by sprinkling consecrated salts on the earthly
      remains of a ghost or the affected area of a
      haunt.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft (alchemy)</strong> DC
