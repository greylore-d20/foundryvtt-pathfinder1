      <p>The alchemist can infuse her bombs with a special unction that damages
      incorporeal creatures and reveals the presence of undead creatures hiding
      in the area. Incorporeal creatures struck by an ectoplasmic bomb take full
      damage from the bomb. In addition, squares in the affected area of the
      bomb begin to faintly glow in the spaces where undead creatures have
      traveled in the last minute, including undead benefiting from invisibility
      or other forms of obscurity (such as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.btccs4sjo2nog1a0]{Ethereal Jaunt}), effectively
      creating a glowing trail. Any undead creatures in the affected area at the
      time of the explosion likewise glow faintly. This glowing effect lasts for
      1 minute, and is otherwise identical to
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.bl71og1gklwncmt7]{Faerie Fire}.</p><hr
