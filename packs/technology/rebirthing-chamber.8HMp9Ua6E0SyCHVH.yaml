      charges/day</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This enclosed pod of metal and
      plastic contains a thinly padded bed on which to lay, and dozens of small
      vents along its interior. A rebirthing chamber cannot operate on its own
      power, and must be attached to an external power source. When a Small or
      Medium humanoid lies within a rebirthing chamber, the chamber
      automatically seals. Soporific gas fills the chamber, inducing a deathlike
      coma (Fortitude DC 30 each round negates; this is a poison effect). One
      minute after it seals, the chamber floods with nanites that first analyze,
      then reduce the occupant to its component molecules. The dismantling
      process deals 6d10 points of damage and 1d4 point of Constitution drain
      each round (Fortitude DC 30 half), a horrifically painful process should
      the occupant retain consciousness. Any gear worn by the occupant is
      dismantled and destroyed, with possibly catastrophic results for
      explosives and powered devices.</p><p>Over the next 1d4 days, the nanites
      reconstruct and enhance the occupant, in effect optimizing its genetic
      code. The occupant wakes up with full memories of its prior existence, but
      in the body of a young adult of its race, halfway between the minimum and
      maximum age of its current age category. In the process, all ability
      scores receive a +2 inherent bonus.</p><p>Each time a rebirthing chamber
      is used, there is a 10% chance its nanite reconstruction fails, leaving
      the host dead and without remains. Only a <em>miracle</em>, <em>true
      resurrection</em>, or <em>wish</em> can restore such a hapless victim. The
      nanite reservoir contains sufficient nanites for five rebirths, assuming
      it hasn't been previously used.</p><p>A rebirthing chamber only works on
      humanoids and humanoid corporeal undead. It can even restore life to a
      long-dead corpse, so long as usable genetic information remains, but with
      a 25% chance of failure instead of 10%. For each day that passed without
      preservation such as <em>gentle repose</em>, the revived creature loses
      roughly 10% of its memories and gains 1 permanent negative level. If the
      negative levels gained exceed the creature's level, the revival fails.
      Intelligent corporeal undead retain their memories after revival, but lose
      all undead abilities and regain their original statistics and abilities
      from their time among the living. Effects that restore these negative
      levels also restore these lost memories.</p><p>Attempts to rebirth a
      creature without a soul invariably fail, as do attempts to rebirth a
      creature from partial remains while the creature is still alive. A body is
      created and draws breath, but lacks any intellect and dies 2d6 hours after
      the process completed.</p>
