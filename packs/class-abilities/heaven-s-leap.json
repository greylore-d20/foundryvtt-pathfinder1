As a standard action, the shaman can designate herself or a single ally that she can see who is within 30 feet of her. She can move that creature as if it were subject to @Compendium[pf1.spells.99ihqk5u93smyy9x]{Jester's Jaunt}.</p>\n<p>Once targeted by this hex, the ally cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>"
