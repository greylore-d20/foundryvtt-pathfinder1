  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can animate a lantern and order it to follow you. The lantern
      floats at shoulder height and remains within 5 feet of you, no matter how
      fast you move. The lantern cannot support any additional weight. The
      lantern illuminates its normal area, even if it does not have any oil in
      it. For the purposes of spells or effects targeting it the lantern always
      acts as if in your possession even when not directly on your person. A
      <i>dancing lantern</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i>
      spell (CL 9th, 2,500 gp).</p>
