      <p><strong>Source</strong> Ultimate Magic pg. 57</p><p>Once per day, you
      can turn a creature into wood. As a standard action, you may direct your
      gaze against a single creature within 30 feet. The targeted creature
      (along with all its carried gear) must make a Fortitude save or turn into
      a mindless, inert statue made out of wood for a number of rounds equal to
      1/2 your oracle level. This ability otherwise functions as a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.361rc74674l3zt9a]{Flesh to Stone} spell, except the
      target turns to wood instead of stone. This can be reverse by any effect
      that can reverse flesh to stone.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
