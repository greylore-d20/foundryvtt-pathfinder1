      <p><b>Element</b> universal; <b>Type</b> utility (Su); <b>Level</b> 3;
      <b>Burn</b> 0<br><b>Prerequisite</b> elemental whispers</p>

      <p>Your friendship with the elements has grown. You gain your choice of a
      wysp or Small elemental of your primary element as an improved familiar,
      without needing to meet any of the usual prerequisites for gaining such a
      familiar. Unlike with elemental whispers, this improved familiar acts in
      all ways like a familiar: it’s always manifested, it has hit points equal
      to 1/2 your own, and so on. You no longer receive the familiar benefits
      from the original creature you selected.</p>

      <p>If your improved familiar dies, you can still contact its voice in your
      mind and gain the Alertness feat, but you can’t cause it to manifest. If
      you pay the usual costs for replacing a familiar, you manifest a new form
      for your elemental friend.</p>
