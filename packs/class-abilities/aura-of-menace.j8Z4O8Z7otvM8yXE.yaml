  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of menace as a standard
      action. Enemies in this aura take a â€“2 penalty to AC and on attacks and
      saves as long as they remain inside the aura. You can use this ability for
      a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not
      need to be consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Holy Lance power of the Good Domain or the
      Staff of Order power of the Law Domain.</p>
