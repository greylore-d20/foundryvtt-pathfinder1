    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash
      a beam of cascading colors at any one target within 30 feet. Doing so
      requires a ranged touch attack. If the beam hits, the target is blinded
      for 1 round if it has a number of Hit Dice equal to or lower than your
      occultist level.</p>

      <p>A foe with a number of Hit Dice greater than your occultist level is
      instead dazzled for 1 round.</p>

      <p>The foe can attempt a Will save to negate the effect.</p>

      <p>Regardless of whether it succeeds at its save, the target is then
      immune to this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting illusion
      effect.</p>
