      <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that all
      creatures within the radius of the <i>symbol of insanity</i> instead
      become permanently insane (as the <i>insanity</i> spell).</p><p>Unlike
      <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>symbol of insanity</i> has no hit point limit;
      once triggered, a <i>symbol of insanity</i> simply remains active for 10
      minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol
      of insanity</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the
      Perception skill to find a <i>symbol of insanity</i> and Disable Device to
      thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of
      insanity</i>.</p>
