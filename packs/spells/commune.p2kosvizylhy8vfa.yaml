  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You contact your deity--or agents thereof--and ask questions that can be
    answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a
    philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster
    level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's
    knowledge. "Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the
    Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word
    answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short
    phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.</p><p>The
    spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The
    entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If
    you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell
    ends.</p>
