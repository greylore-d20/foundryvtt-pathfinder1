  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You grant your lungs inhuman strength and capacity, allowing you to
    harmlessly and completely inhale one gas, fog, smoke, mist, or similar
    cloud-like effect. If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must
    succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + the effect's caster level) to
    inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it from the area, leaving normal air
    in its place. If the cloud is too large for you to affect with a single
    casting of this spell, you may instead inhale a portion of the cloud, but
    you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to you. This spell has no
    effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration
    cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in
    response.  While inhaled, the cloud does not harm you. You may keep the
    cloud harmlessly contained within you for up to 1 round per level, but you
    must hold your breath to do so (even if you do not normally have to
    breathe). If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained
    within you counts toward that duration. As a standard action, you may
    release the stored cloud as a breath weapon, filling a 60-foot cone (or the
    cloud's original area, if smaller than a 60-foot cone). Any creature in the
    breath's area is subject to its normal effects, making saving throws and
    spell resistance checks as appropriate against the cloud's original DC. The
    exhaled cloud resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud ends
    this spell. If you do not exhale the cloud before this spell's duration
    expires, you suffer the cloud's effects and automatically fail any saving
    throw to resist it.</p>
