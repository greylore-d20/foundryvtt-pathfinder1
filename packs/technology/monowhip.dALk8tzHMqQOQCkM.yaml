      touch</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A monowhip is a deadly melee weapon
      capable of inflicting horrible wounds, even in the hands of the weak. An
      inactive monowhip looks like a short metal baton, but when it's activated,
      a small weight detaches, revealing a 15-foot-long monofilament length.
      Wielded like a whip, a monowhip slices deeply into targets and can inflict
      grievous critical hits with shocking ease. Attacks made with a monowhip
      resolve as touch attacks, and they ignore hardness as if the monofilament
      were made of adamantine. A monowhip's damage cannot be enhanced by
      strength, as the monofilament slices with equal ease regardless of the
      force applied. Activating a monowhip is a move action; once activated, the
      whip consumes power incredibly quickly, at the rate of 1 charge per
      round.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 32;
