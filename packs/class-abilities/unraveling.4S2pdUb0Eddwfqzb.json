This functions as a targeted @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic} spell, but you must be adjacent to the effect to unravel it. If the effect is created by psychic magic, you receive a +5 bonus on your caster level check to unravel it. If the effect targets an object in your possession, you automatically succeed at the check.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>"
