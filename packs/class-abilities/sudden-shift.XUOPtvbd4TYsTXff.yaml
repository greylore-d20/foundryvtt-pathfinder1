    value: >-
      <p>In the blink of an eye, you can appear somewhere else. As an immediate
      action, after you are missed by a melee attack, you can teleport up to 10
      feet to a space that you can see. This space must be inside the reach of
      the creature that attacked you. You can use this power a number of times
      each day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Copycat power of the Trickery Domain.</p>
