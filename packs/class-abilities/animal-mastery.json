      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can project your mind into the mind of an animal you can see, establishing a mental link that allows you to share the animal’s senses—hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the animal does. You cannot use this ability on an animal if its Hit Dice exceed your psychic level. The animal can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If it is successful, the animal is immune to this ability for 24 hours. While sharing an animal’s senses, your body is effectively unconscious, but you can end the effect as a free action.</p>\n<p>You can maintain the link for 1 hour per level, but the link is immediately severed if the animal moves beyond a range of 1 mile per psychic level you have.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, the mental link becomes stronger. Whenever you share an animal’s senses, you can control it, as per dominate animal, except the duration, Hit Dice limit, range, and other conditions listed above apply.</p>"
