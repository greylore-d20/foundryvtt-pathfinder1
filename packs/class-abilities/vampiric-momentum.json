      "value": "<p>The vampire hunter is treated as being under the effects of the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.68m9du7zw2di7ew6]{Feather Fall}. At 8th level, he is also affected as if by the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.3mfmhx8avu7h3iom]{Spider Climb}&nbsp;and can move normally through difficult terrain. At 16th level, he is treated as being under the effects of the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.lvzq2mwkqmozolpl]{Freedom of Movement}, and can use up to two consecutive move actions in the same turn to cross areas of open air or calm water (or similar substances) as if they were solid ground, though the vampire hunter must begin and end this movement on solid ground. This allows the vampire hunter to cross water, open air, lava (though he takes fire damage as normal if not immune), and the like without falling or sinking.</p>"
