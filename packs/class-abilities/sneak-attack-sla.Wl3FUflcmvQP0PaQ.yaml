  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself
      effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage.
      The slayer’s attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied
      a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus
      or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is
      1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should
      the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional
      damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only
      if the target is within 30 feet.<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal
      damage (like a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak
      attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use
      a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak
      attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty.<p>The slayer must be able to
      see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to
      reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a
      creature with concealment.</p>
