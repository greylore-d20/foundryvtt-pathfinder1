This energy has three effects.</p><p>First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by evil creatures.</p><p>Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the effects with a successful Will save (spell resistance applies). This use discharges and ends the spell.</p><p>Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Spells that can't be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i> also can't be dispelled by <i>dispel evil</i>. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.</p>",
