      "value": "<p>Mercenaries in the employ of the Aspis Consortium often use wands of @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility} to attack protected targets, then blend into the crowd to escape or disguise the source of the next attack. A rogue with this ability is practiced at attacking from magical concealment. He can use spell-trigger and spellcompletion items as if the following spells were on a spell list to which he has access: @Compendium[pf1.spells.cxgi0ub77t6aink1]{Invisibility, Greater}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.oylikodnyku2zewu]{Invisibility}, and @Compendium[pf1.spells.c11olzqztodz5o5x]{Vanish}.<br><br>Additionally, if the rogue becomes visible as a result of a weapon or spell attack, he can sheathe his weapon as a free action and instantly adopt a neutral posture. With a successful Bluff or Disguise check (opposed by witnesses’ Sense Motive or Perception checks, whichever is higher), there is no obvious sign that the rogue is the source of the attack (though a lack of any other reasonable candidate can still lead observers to draw the correct conclusion).</p>"
