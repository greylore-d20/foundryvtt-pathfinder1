  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon grows dangerous claws on its feet, allowing it to make 2
      rake attacks on foes it is grappling. These attacks are primary attacks.
      The eidolon receives these additional attacks each time it succeeds on a
      grapple check against the target. These rake attacks deal 1d4 points of
      damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge).</p>

      <p>This evolution is only available to eidolons of the quadruped base
      form. This evolution counts as one natural attack toward te eidolon's
      maximum.</p>

      <p>The summoner must be at least 4th level before selecting this
      evolution.</p>
