Though this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benef it from concealment or invisibility.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes an amount of electricity damage equal to the shamanâ€™s Charisma modifier. The sparking aura lasts a 1 round for ever 2 shaman levels the shaman possesses.</p>\n<p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>"
