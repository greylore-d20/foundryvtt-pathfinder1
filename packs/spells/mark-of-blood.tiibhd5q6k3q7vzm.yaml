    value: >-
      <p>You place a drop of your blood on a weapon and charge it with magic so
      that you transfer a small amount of your life essence to the next living
      creature you strike with the weapon. Thereafter, you can spend a move
      action to know the direction and general distance of that creature. The
      target can negate this effect with a successful Will save. You must strike
      a creature within 1 minute of casting this spell or the magic is wasted,
      but once the Mark of Blood takes effect it is permanent until dispelled or
      removed via an effect like <i>remove curse</i>.</p>
