  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Ithuna Vardsdottir claims to have unearthed this ancient prayer in a
    ruined temple of Desna, though Pathfinders have reported the use of similar
    magic in Irrisen among the White Witches. While the name of this spell is
    <i>sharesister</i>, it works equally well on male or female creatures-both
    targets of the spell must simply be of the same gender.</p><p>When you
    deliver the spell, you receive a negative level for the duration of the
    spell, and the other target receives a +1 insight bonus to her caster level
    and a +1 insight bonus to the save DCs of all of her spells. At 11th level,
    you can opt to take four negative levels to grant a +2 insight bonus to the
    other target's caster level and spell save DCs if you wish, while at 17th
    level you can take 6 negative levels to increase the insight bonus to +3.
    Any effect that removes or prevents the negative level immediately ends the
    <i>sharesister</i> spell. Negative levels received from the spell vanish as
    soon as this spell effect ends.</p><p>Negative levels from multiple castings
    of this spell stack.</p>
