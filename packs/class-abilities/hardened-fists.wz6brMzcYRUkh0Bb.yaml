  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can make your fists grow large, callused, and gnarled
      as a <em>free action</em>. Your unarmed strikes deal damage as though you
      were one size category larger, deal lethal damage, and do not provoke
      <em>attacks of opportunity</em>. If you have claws, they are affected
      instead, and they deal damage as though you were one size category larger.
      You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Charisma</em> modifier. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>
