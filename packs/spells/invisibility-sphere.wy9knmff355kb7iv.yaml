      <p>This spell functions like <i>invisibility</i>, except that this spell
      confers <i>invisibility</i> upon all creatures within 10 feet of the
      recipient at the time the spell is cast. The center of the effect is
      mobile with the recipient.</p><p>Those affected by this spell can see each
      other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature
      moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area
      after the spell is cast do not become invisible.</p><p>Affected creatures
      (other than the recipient) who attack negate the <i>invisibility</i> only
      for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the <i>invisibility</i>
      sphere ends.</p>
