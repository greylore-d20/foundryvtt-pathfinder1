      "value": "<p><em>A hierophant spirit is a being of true and pure faith.</em><p><strong>Spirit Bonus: </strong>When you channel a hierophant, your spirit bonus applies on Wisdom checks, Wisdom-based skill checks, and Will saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Seance Boon: </strong>Your healing spells and abilities heal an additional 2 points of damage to each target. This does not affect healing conferred by magic items, nor does it add to fast healing or similar effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations: </strong>Altars, churches, sacred groves, shrines.</p>\n<p><strong>Influence Penalty: </strong>Whether the spirit hopes to offer a chance for redemption or to sacrifice foes later on a dark altar, you must strike for nonlethal damage in combat whenever possible. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks involving worshipers of faiths other than the spirit’s, except checks to convince others to convert to the spirit’s faith.</p>\n<p><strong>Taboos: </strong>Choose one: you must strongly revere nature and may not wear metal armor or shields; you must follow a paladin or antipaladin code as appropriate for the spirit’s deity; you may not deliberately speak any lies, including bluffing, exaggerating, stating half-truths with intent to deceive, lies by omission, and so on, and if you know the answer to a question that someone asks you, you must give the answer.</p>"
