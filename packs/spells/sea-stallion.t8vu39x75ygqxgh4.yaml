  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>sea steed</i>, but as long as you stay
      mounted on the target, you also gain the amphibious quality and your melee
      attacks function as if you were under the effect of <i>freedom of
      movement</i>. The benefits you gain from this spell are not polymorph
      effects. If you dismount from the target, you retain the amphibious
      quality for up to 1 minute, but not the other benefits. You regain all of
      the benefits once you mount the target creature again.</p>
