  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell surrounds you with an aura of nothingness that channels the
    mysterious energies of the Dark Tapestry. Creatures adjacent to you when
    this spell is cast and at the start of your turn take 2d6 points of damage.
    In addition, creatures affected by your aura are fatigued, cannot breathe,
    and cannot speak or cast spells with somatic components. Creatures adjacent
    to you are allowed a Reflex save to halve the damage and negate the fatigue
    effect, but cannot breathe or speak regardless of whether their save is
    successful as long as they are adjacent to you.</p>
