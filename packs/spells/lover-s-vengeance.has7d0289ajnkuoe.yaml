    value: >-
      <p>You inspire yourself or a lover to a vengeful <i>rage</i> against a
      chosen enemy, who must be a creature that has wronged you in some way. If
      cast on you, the next time you are in combat with that enemy, you gain the
      benefits of a <i>rage</i> spell. If cast on a lover, he or she gains the
      benefits of a <i>rage</i> spell the next time the lover is in combat
      against your enemy. This variant of the spell must be cast within 1 hour
      of an intimate encounter with the target. The <i>rage</i> effect lasts 1
      round per level. If the creature that triggers the <i>rage</i> effect is
      one of your lovers or ex-lovers, the benefits granted by the <i>rage</i>
      spell double. This spell counts as a <i>contingency</i> spell on the
      target for the purpose of multiple contingent effects. Worshipers of
      Calistria are fond of using this spell, and many keep the effect running
      whenever possible.</p>
