      <p>As <i>beast shape III</i>, except you change the form of up to one
      willing creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell
      has no effect on unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same
      kind of animal form. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell
      expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition, an
      individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round
      action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone.</p>
