If, within 8 hours of consuming a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Meal\">meal</a> seasoned with Sugar lemons, you gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused\">confused</a> condition, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the result from the result of your d% roll to determine what action you take for the first round in which you are <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused\">confused</a>. This benefit does not stack with itself.</p>\r\n<p>The price and weight listed represent a jar containing enough preserved lemons to season 10 meals.</p>\r\n"
