      "value": "<p>Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.mxqi375ya2rka7cp]{True Resurrection}. Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a @Compendium[pf1.spells.thh46ghi51lrl3cl]{Resurrection}&nbsp;spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must be at least 16th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
