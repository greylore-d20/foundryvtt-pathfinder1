  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Certain master ninjas possess a seemingly limitless supply of their
      trusted weapons. Whenever a ninja with this trick buys a set of 50
      identical magic shuriken, she thereafter replenishes them at no cost and
      never runs out. This stock of magical shuriken can be upgraded as though
      it were a normal magic weapon, and shuriken upgraded this way likewise
      never run out.</p>
