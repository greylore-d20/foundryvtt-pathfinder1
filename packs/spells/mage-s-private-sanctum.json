No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally.</p><p>Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to <i>detect thoughts</i>. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other communication, such as a <i>sending</i> or <i>message</i> spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar.</p><p>The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.</p><p>Mage's private sanctum can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>",
