      <p><b>Element</b> fire; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 3;
      <b>Burn</b> 1<br><b>Prerequisite</b> heat adaptation, searing flesh</p>

      <p>You create an aura of shimmering heat that distorts the area around
      you. Until the next time your burn is removed, you can begin or end the
      heat aura as a swift action. The temperature in the area 30 feet around
      you rises by 5° F per kineticist level you possess, to a maximum modified
      temperature of 120° F. If this brings the temperature to at least 90° F,
      all attacks made by creatures within 5 feet of you suffer a 20% miss
      chance due to concealment. You are immune to these effects, as are those
      immune to fire or benefiting from endure elements.</p>
