    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, when the cavalier hits the target of his challenge with
      a melee attack, and that target is at least two size categories larger
      than the cavalier, he gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 his
      cavalier level. This damage is multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
