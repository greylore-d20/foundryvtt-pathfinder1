      <p>You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence
      or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle,
      as many as eight can be affected by the <i>plane shift</i> at the same
      time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended
      plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other
      plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended
      destination. <i>Plane shift</i> transports creatures instantaneously and
      then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel
      back (including casting <i>plane shift</i> again).</p>
