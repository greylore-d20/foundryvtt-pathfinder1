  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>interposing hand</i>, except that it can
      also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The <i><i>forceful</i>
      hand</i> gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack does not provoke
      an attack of opportunity. Its CMB for bull rush checks uses your caster
      level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +8 bonus for its Strength
      score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always moves with the
      opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no movement limit
      for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.
      <i>Forceful hand</i> prevents the opponent from moving closer to you
      without first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the
      <i><i>forceful</i> hand</i> and the target closer to you. The
      <i><i>forceful</i> hand</i> can instead be directed to interpose itself,
      as <i>interposing hand</i> does.</p>
