    value: >-
      <p>Your melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage + 1
      point per level, and the target is fatigued. The fatigued condition ends
      when the target recovers from the nonlethal damage. This spell cannot make
      a creature exhausted even if it is already fatigued. You can use this
      melee touch attack up to one time per level.</p>
