  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can call upon Torag’s protection to form a
      shield around you that blocks incoming attacks for a number of minutes
      equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1). The shield grants a +4
      deflection bonus to your Armor Class.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, and again at 11th level and 15th level, this bonus
      increases by +1.</p>

      <p>At 19th level, the shield also grants you DR 2/chaos. The shield’s
      duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute
      increments.</p>
