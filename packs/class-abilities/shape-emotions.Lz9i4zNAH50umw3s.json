If you choose to ward, you and your allies within this aura receive a +4 <em>morale bonus</em> on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects, and any fear effects targeting you or your allies are reduced by one step (<em>shaken</em> has no effect, <em>frightened</em> becomes <em>shaken</em>, and <em>panicked</em> becomes <em>frightened</em>). If you chose to enhance emotional influence, enemies within the aura receive a â€“2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>"
