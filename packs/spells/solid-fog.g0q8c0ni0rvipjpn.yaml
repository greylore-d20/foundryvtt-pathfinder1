  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>fog cloud</i>, but in addition to
      obscuring sight, the <i>solid fog</i> is so thick that it impedes
      movement.</p><p>Creatures moving through a <i>solid fog</i> move at half
      their normal speed and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee
      damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except
      for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into
      <i>solid fog</i> is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes
      through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a
      5-foot-step while in <i>solid fog</i>. <i>Solid fog</i>, and effects that
      work like <i>solid fog</i>, do not stack with each other in terms of
      slowed movement and attack penalties.</p><p>Unlike normal fog, only a
      severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1
      round.</p><p><i>Solid fog</i> can be made permanent with a
      <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>solid fog</i> dispersed by wind
      reforms in 10 minutes.</p>
