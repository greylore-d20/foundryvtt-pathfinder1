      <p>This saucerlike object has a flat bottom, a handle, and a spike on top.
      You can affix a @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.jewqhqesccxrvivd]{candle}
      onto the spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the candlestick by
      the handle. The flat bottom means youâ€™re able to set it down and not worry
      about the candle falling over and extinguishing itself. A typical
      candlestick is crafted from baked clay or a cheap metal such as copper,
      but elaborate and expensive ones exist.</p>
