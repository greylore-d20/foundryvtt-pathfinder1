      "value": "<p>A bard is trained to use the <em>Perform</em> skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his <em>Charisma</em> modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.</p>\n<p>Starting a bardic performance is a <em>standard action</em>, but it can be maintained each round as a <em>free action</em>. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a <em>standard action</em>. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, <em>paralyzed</em>, <em>stunned</em>, knocked <em>unconscious</em>, or otherwise prevented from taking a <em>free action</em> to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a <em>move action</em> instead of a <em>standard action</em>. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a <em>swift action</em>.</p>\n<p>Each bardic performance has audible <em>components</em>, visual <em>components</em>, or both.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A <em>deaf</em> bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A <em>blind</em> bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.</p>"
