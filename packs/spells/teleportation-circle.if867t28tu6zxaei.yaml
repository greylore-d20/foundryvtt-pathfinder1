    value: >-
      <p>You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that
      teleports, as @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.5cdmojmydhwowzy1]{greater
      teleport}<em>,</em> any creature who stands on it to a designated spot.
      Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it.
      The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures
      into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have
      no clear description, or to another plane.</p><p>The circle itself is
      subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures
      from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some
      way.</p><p><em>Teleportation circle</em> can be made permanent with a
      <em>permanency</em> spell. A permanent <em>teleportation circle</em> that
      is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again
      as normal.</p><p>Magic traps such as <em>teleportation circle</em> are
      hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature
      can use the Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is
      25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of <em>teleportation circle</em>.</p>
