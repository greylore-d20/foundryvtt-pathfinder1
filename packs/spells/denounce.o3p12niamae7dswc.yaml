      <p>You speak out against a single creature within line of sight and turn
      possible allies against it by drawing upon the power of your voice and
      conviction. Creatures in the area who can see the <i>denounce</i>d
      creature must make a Will saving throw or have their starting attitude
      toward the <i>denounce</i>d creature worsened by two levels (see page 94
      of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). For example, creatures previously
      indifferent to the subject turn unfriendly.</p><p>Diplomacy checks made to
