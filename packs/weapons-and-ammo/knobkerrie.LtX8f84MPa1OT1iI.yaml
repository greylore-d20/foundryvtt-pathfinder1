  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A knobkerrie, or iwisa, is carved from a single piece of hardwood with
      a shaft 2 to 4 feet long surmounted by a bulbous knob. The knobkerrie is a
      traditional hunting weapon among the Zenj people of the Mwangi, but it's
      also used as a symbol of authority. Many tribal elders use decorated
      knobkerries as scepters or canes. A knobkerrie is thrown end-over-end. If
      you are proficient, you gain a +1 bonus on ranged attack rolls with a
      knobkerrie against opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy
      shields. If you aren't proficient with a knobkerrie, treat it as a
      club.</p>
