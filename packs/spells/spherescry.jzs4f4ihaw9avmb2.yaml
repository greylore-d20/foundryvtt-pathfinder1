  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell allows remote viewing through spheres that have previously
      consumed some portion of the spellcaster's body: a single digit of a
      finger or toe at a minimum. The caster can view and listen to events
      within a 20-foot radius of the associated sphere; this radius follows the
      sphere if the sphere moves. Unlike a true <i>scrying</i> spell, no other
      spells operate through the associated sphere, but <i>spherescry</i>
      produces no indication of its activity on the target and cannot be
      discovered by normal methods of magical detection.</p>
