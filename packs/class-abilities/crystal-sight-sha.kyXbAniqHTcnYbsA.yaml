  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman sees through stone, earth, or sand as easily as if it were
      transparent crystal. Her gaze can penetrate a number of feet equal to her
      shaman level (or 1/12th this thickness of metal). The shaman can use this
      ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these
      rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
