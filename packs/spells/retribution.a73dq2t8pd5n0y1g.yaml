      <p><i>Retribution</i> blasts those who have the temerity to assault your
      person. You may target anyone who has just struck you with an attack
      within the previous round, whether with a melee, ranged, or natural
      weapon, or a spell that requires an attack roll. The target is wracked
      with shooting pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skills
      checks, and ability checks. On a successful Fortitude save, the penalty
      only lasts for 1 round.</p><p>A target who worships the same god as you
      takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw.</p>
