      <p>This minor curse interferes with the target’s ability to speak. On a
      failed save, the target has difficulty stringing words together. Only with
      great concentration can he communicate intelligibly. Speaking in combat
      becomes a move-equivalent action rather than a free action. If the target
      attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, he has a 50% chance of
      making an error and losing the spell. Even if he can successfully cast a
      spell, doing so takes 1 round if the spell’s normal casting time is less
      than 1 round. If the spell’s casting time is usually 1 round or longer,
      its casting time doubles (up until the end of <em>impede speech</em>).
      <em>Impede speech</em> cannot be dispelled, but
