      B</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Technically not a unique kind of weapon, a
      stitched sling is a sling, staff sling, or double sling whose cup is sewn
      closed around the ammunition, creating a weak sort of light flail. The
      ammunition sewn into the sling is irrelevant to the type and amount of
      damage it causes. A stitched sling cannot be used to fire ammunition
      unless the thread or cord holding the cup closed is cut open (a full-round
      action that provokes attacks of opportunity).</p>
