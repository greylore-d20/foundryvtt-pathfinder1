    value: >-
      <p>When making a sneak attack against an opponent with an alignment
      subtype, a rogue with this talent can forgo her sneak attack damage to
      scramble the creature’s metaphysical nature. If the attack succeeds, the
      rogue deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a
      Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the rogue’s level + the rogue’s
      Intelligence modifier) or lose all damage reduction overcome by aligned
      weapons (such as DR 10/good), lose all regeneration overcome by aligned
      sources (such as regeneration 10 [good]), and lose the ability to cast
      spells and use spell-like abilities with alignment descriptors for 1 round
      for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage the rogue would have dealt
      (minimum 1 round). The rogue must have the aligned sneak attack talent to
      select this talent.</p>
