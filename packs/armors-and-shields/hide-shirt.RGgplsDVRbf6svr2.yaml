  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Made from animal hide and giant lizard scales over a shirt of
      interwoven cords, these chest and shoulder coverings protect Shoanti
      riders without restricting their mobility. The wearer of a hide shirt can
      make a DC 15 Strength check as a standard action. If he succeeds, the
      armor gains the broken condition and drops to the ground rather than
      requiring the usual 1 minute it would take to remove it. The armor must be
      repaired as though it had taken 8 points of damage before it can be used
      again; a broken hide shirt grants no bonus to Armor Class.</p>
