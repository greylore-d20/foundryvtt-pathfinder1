    value: >-
      <p><em>You know how to make an enemy pay for lax
      defenses.</em></p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you are adjacent
      to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on
      attacks of opportunity against creatures that you both threaten. Enemies
      that provoke attacks of opportunity from your ally also provoke attacks of
      opportunity from you so long as you threaten them (even if the situation
      or an ability would normally deny you the attack of opportunity). This
      does not allow you to take more than one attack of opportunity against a
      creature for a given action.</p><h4>Combat Trick</h4><p>As long as an ally
      that also has this feat is within your melee reach, you can spend 2
      stamina points to gain this featâ€™s benefits until the end of your next
      turn.</p>
