      <p>You plunge an area into the brutal chill of the arctic
      night.</p><p>Illumination conditions are dropped by two steps (though only
      to darkness, not supernatural darkness), and all creatures in the area
      take 5d6 points of cold damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage per
      round. A successful Fortitude save each round negates the Dexterity damage
      but not the cold damage.</p><p>Any creature that doesn't move on its turn
      becomes encased in a sheath of ice equivalent to <i>Wall of Ice</i>, is
      helpless, and cannot breathe. Corpses in the area for longer than 1 round
      are transmuted into solid ice; reviving the icy corpse requires <i>true
      resurrection</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. As a move action, you
      may move the area of effect up to 10 feet in any direction.</p>
