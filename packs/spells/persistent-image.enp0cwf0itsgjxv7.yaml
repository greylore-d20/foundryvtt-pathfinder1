      <p>This spell functions like <i>silent image,</i> except that the figment
      includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and the
      figment follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that
      script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include
      intelligible speech if you wish.</p>
