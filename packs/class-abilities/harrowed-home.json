      "value": "<p>At 15th level, your otherworldly connection is so strong that your subconscious cleaves off a small portion of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/harrowed\">Harrowed</a>&nbsp;Realm for use as your own private sanctuary. Your harrowed home is created the first time you use this ability, and is decorated as a garish reflection of your personality. Thereafter, you always visit this same home. You can place a portal to your harrowed home once every 24 hours, but placing a new portal destroys the previous one, and you can not move the entrance while you are inside. As long as you are not in your harrowed home, time ceases to pass for anything and anyone still in your pocket dimension; creatures cannot move, objects do not decay, and everything remains exactly the same as you left it the last time you visited the plane. Time continues as normal whenever you are inside your harrowed home. This ability is otherwise identical to @Compendium[pf1.spells.kqftgm3bi2dqj92l]{Mage's Magnificent Mansion}.</p>"
