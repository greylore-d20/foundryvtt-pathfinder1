A target splashed with it smells like weak prey to predators. Creatures with the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">scent</a> ability can detect a marked creature at five times the normal range, note its direction as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, pinpoint it when it is within 25 feet, and track it by scent with a +5 bonus on its <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a> checks. Immersion in water within 1 round of exposure washes it off; otherwise the effect decreases by one range increment per day (four times normal range after 1 day, three times range after 2 days, and so on) until the creature is again at normal scent levels.</p>\r\n<p><b>Create</b>: <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a> (alchemy) DC 20</p>\r\n"
