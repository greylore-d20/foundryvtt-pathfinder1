    value: >-
      <p>In place of an attack of opportunity, a character with this talent can
      attempt a Sleight of Hand check against the CMD of an opponent that
      provokes an attack of opportunity by firing a projectile weapon while
      threatened. If successful, the character plucks the ammunition from the
      provoking weapon, negating the attack. The character may use this ability
      as many times in a round as she could make attacks of opportunity. At the
      GMâ€™s discretion, certain projectile weapons may not be susceptible to this
      ability, such as siege engines or firearms. A character must be trained in
      Sleight of Hand to select this talent.</p>
