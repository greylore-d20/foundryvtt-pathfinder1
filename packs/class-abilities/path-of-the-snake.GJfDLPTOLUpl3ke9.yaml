  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, as a standard action, you can become incorporeal. While
      in this form, you gain a +10 bonus on Stealth checks and can move in any
      direction and through any object (except for those made of force). You can
      take no action other than to move while in this form. You remain in this
      form for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level, but you can end
      this effect prematurely with a standard action.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
