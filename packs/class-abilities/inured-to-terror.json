As an immediate action when a slayer fails a saving throw against a fear effect, he can attempt the saving throw a second time to reduce the severity of the effect from panicked to frightened, frightened to shaken, or shaken to unaffected. Additionally, the DC of Intimidate checks to demoralize him increases by 2.</p>"
