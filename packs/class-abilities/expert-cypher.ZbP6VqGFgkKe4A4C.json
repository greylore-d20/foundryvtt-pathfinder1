In addition, when the rogue attempts a Use Magic Device check to cast a spell from a scroll, she is treated as though she had the minimum score in the appropriate ability score to cast that spell. Finally, the rogue can choose to add her Intelligence modifier to her Use Magic Device skill checks instead of her Charisma modifier.</p>"
