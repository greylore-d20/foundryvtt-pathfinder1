  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can touch an ally to summon a floating
      blockade of stone, granting the ally the benefits of partial cover for 1
      round plus 1 round for every 6 cleric levels you possess. This ability
      does not grant the ally enough cover to attempt a Stealth check or avoid
      provoking attacks of opportunity. If the ally benefits from any other form
      of cover against an attack, the bonuses to AC and on Reflex saving throws
      increase by 1. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3
      + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This pwoer replaces the Resistant Touch power of the Protection
      Domain.</p>
