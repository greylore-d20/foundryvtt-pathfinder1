  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can use meditative techniques that temporarily cause attacks to
      bounce off your skin, as long as you arenâ€™t wearing armor or carrying a
      medium or heavy load. These techniques grant you a +4 armor bonus to
      AC.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by
      2.</p>

      <p>At 13th level, the techniques also grant DR 5/unarmed strikes or
      natural attacks. You can gain the benefits of ascetic armor for 1 hour per
      day per oracle level. The hours do not need to be consecutive, but you
      must spend them in 1-hour increments.</p>
