      <p>The spell functions as <i>mind swap</i>, except as noted above. In
      addition, after 24 hours, instead of using each other's hit points, you
      each revert to your original hit points, modified by your new Constitution
      modifiers. This spell can be reversed only with <i>miracle</i>,
      <i>wish</i>, or another major <i>mind swap</i>.</p>
