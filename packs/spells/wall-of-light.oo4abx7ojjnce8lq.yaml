  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An immobile, blinding curtain of white light that blocks line of sight
      springs into existence. The wall sheds bright light to a range of 60 feet
      in all directions. A creature adjacent to the wall is blinded as long as
      it remains adjacent plus an additional 1d4 rounds thereafter-closing its
      eyes or succeeding at a Fortitude save negates the effect for 1 round. A
      creature that passes through the wall is automatically blinded, even if
      its eyes are closed. A creature from the Plane of Shadow gains 1d4
      negative levels each round it spends within 5 feet of the wall (Fortitude
      negates). Passing through the wall imposes a -4 penalty on the save for
      that round. Twenty-four hours after gaining these negative levels, the
      subject must attempt a new Fortitude saving throw for each negative level.
      If a save succeeds, 1 negative level is removed. If it fails, the negative
      level becomes permanent. <i>Wall of Light</i> can be made permanent with
      <i>permanency</i> (with a minimum caster level of 13th and cost of 11,000
      gp).</p>
