      "value": "<p>At 15th level, you gain an immersive mindscape. This functions as a permanent @Compendium[pf1.spells.c14tjrds5emxk417]{Create Mindscape, Greater} spell, except it must appear as a lost civilization, and you do not target any other creatures when the mindscape is created. You can open a conduit to your mindscape as a <em>standard action</em> at will (per the mindscape door spell), allowing you or other creatures to enter or leave. The mindscape is only as detailed as your knowledge of the lost civilization but still holds valuable secrets. The mindscape functions as a library for all <em>Knowledge</em> skills; while within your mindscape, you can spend 1d4 hours researching to use a <em>Knowledge</em> (history) check in place of any other <em>Knowledge</em> check.</p>"
