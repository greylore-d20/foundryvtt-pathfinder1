      <p><strong>Source</strong> Legacy of Dragons pg. 9</p><p>Upon reaching
      20th level, your draconic destiny unfolds. You gain immunity to paralysis,
      sleep, and damage of your energy type. You count as a dragon for the
      purposes of spells and magical effects. If you have the breath weapon
      revelation, you can use your breath weapon an unlimited number of times
      per day, though no more often than once every 1d4+1 rounds.</p>
