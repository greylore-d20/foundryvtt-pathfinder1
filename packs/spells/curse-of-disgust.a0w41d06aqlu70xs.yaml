    value: >-
      <p>You place a curse upon a creature, causing it to avoid the sight of a
      specific trigger, which is a kind of creature, object, or condition
      designated by you. When the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and is
      aware of the trigger, it gains the sickened condition and feels an urge to
      leave. A successful Will save negates the urge to leave, but the sickened
      condition persists as long as the target is within 30 feet of a trigger
      and aware of it. Example triggers include beggars, filthy clothing,
      diseased creatures, the king, blood, spiders, rats, corpses, and
      sewage.</p>
