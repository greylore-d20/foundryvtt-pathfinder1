    value: >-
      <p>You create a rolling sphere of churning water that can engulf those it
      strikes. The <em>aqueous orb</em> can move up to 30 feet per round,
      rolling over barriers less than 10 feet tall. It automatically quenches
      any nonmagical fires and functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{dispel magic} against
      magical fires as long as those fires are size Large or less.</p><p>Any
      creature in the path of the <em>aqueous orb</em> takes 2d6 points of
      nonlethal damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage, but a
      Large or smaller creature that fails its save must make a second save or
      be engulfed by the <em>aqueous orb</em> and carried along with it.
      Engulfed creatures are immersed in water and must hold their breath unless
      capable of breathing water. They gain cover against attacks from outside
      the <em>aqueous orb</em> but are considered entangled by its churning
      currents, takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage at the beginning of their
      turn each round they remain trapped. Creatures within the orb may attempt
      a new Reflex save each round to escape into a random square adjacent to
      the <em>aqueous orb</em>. The orb may hold one Large creature, 4 Medium,
      or 16 Small or smaller creatures within it.</p><p>The sphere moves as long
      as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely
      stays at rest and churns in place. An <em>aqueous orb</em> stops if it
      moves outside the spell's range.</p>
