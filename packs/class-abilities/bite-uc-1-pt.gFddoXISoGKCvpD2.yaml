      <p>The eidolonâ€™s maw is full of razor-sharp teeth, giving it a bite
      attack. This attack is a primary attack. The bite deals 1d6 points of
      damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). If the eidolon already has a bite
      attack, this evolution allows it to deal 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier
      on damage rolls made with its bite.</p>
