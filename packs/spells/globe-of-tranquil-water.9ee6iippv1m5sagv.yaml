  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Upon casting this spell, a rippling bubble of calm water extends outward
    from you to a radius of 20 feet and remains centered on you when you move.
    The bubble blocks all natural and magical precipitation such as rain, snow,
    and hail (including spells such as <i>ice</i> storm). This bubble also
    pushes out any fog or mist within the area, though it does not affect
    temperature and can't block natural or magical lightning.  All water in this
    radius counts as calm water for the purposes of Swim checks, and the bubble
    prevents sprays and blasts of mundane and magic water from striking with
    enough force to deal damage, move creatures or halt their movement, or
    perform any action that requires an attack roll or combat maneuver check. 
    Water elementals are affected by a <i>Globe of Tranquil Water</i> the same
    way creatures of the plant type are affected by an <i>antiplant
    shell</i>.</p>
