  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The creature you designate is surrounded by a glowing red aura of
      vengeful fate. Once per round when the target makes an attack or casts a
      spell, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC = 10 + 1/2
      caster level + Charisma (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom (in the case of
      clerics). If the target fails the saving throw, it takes 4d6 + your
      Charisma modifier (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom modifier (in the case
      of clerics) electricity damage. It takes no damage on a successful saving
      throw. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when its subject
      confirms a critical hit to negate the critical hit and daze the creature
      for 1 round. The attack still hits its target and deals normal damage. The
      effects of the daze occur after the attack.</p>
