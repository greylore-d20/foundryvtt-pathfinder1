      <p>This spell is similar to
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.jmtzhbgzqpboahhn]{ethereal envelope}, but
      it allows you to shunt an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and
      seal it there within a cocoon of misty ethereal fibers. If the target
      fails its save, it's forced into a cataleptic meditative state as if
      unconscious. However, each round at the end of its turn, it can attempt a
      Will save to awaken itself from this meditation. Once the target awakens,
      it is considered pinned, treating your caster level as your CMB and your
      CMD as 10 + your caster level + your ability modifier for your primary
      spellcasting ability score. A successful grapple combat maneuver check or
      Escape Artist check leaves the creature grappled rather than pinned but
      doesn't allow it to escape. However, a trapped creature can attack the
      cocoon as described in the <em>ethereal envelope</em> spell
      description.</p><p>If the creature breaks free of the <em>ethereal
      envelopment</em> or you dismiss the spell, the target is returned to its
      prior location on the Material Plane, as described for <em>ethereal
      envelope</em>, but if the target is conscious at the time, it doesn't
      spend a round asleep or staggered.</p>
