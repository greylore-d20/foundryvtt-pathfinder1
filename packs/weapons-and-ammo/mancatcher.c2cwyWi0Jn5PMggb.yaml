  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This polearm consists of two curved metal bands that close around a
      target when you attack, allowing you to bind an opponent. A mancatcher is
      built to capture a creature of a particular size category (such as Small
      or Medium) and doesn't work on creatures of the wrong size. Make a touch
      attack to hit an opponent and a combat maneuver check to grapple him
      (without the -4 penalty for not having two hands free); success means you
      and the target are grappled. Once the target is grappled, you can perform
      a move or damage grapple action against him. The mancatcher has hardness
      10 and 5 hit points; breaking it requires a DC 26 Strength check. If you
      drop the mancatcher, the target can free himself as a standard action.</p>
