Chaotic creatures that take a direct hit from an axiomatic bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, axiomatic bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Axiomatic bombs have no effect on lawful creatures.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
