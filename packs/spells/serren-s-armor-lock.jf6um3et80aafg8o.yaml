  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon pointing at an armored foe, you cause all of the joints of the
      target's armor to stiffen as otherworldly chains wrap around the target.
      On a failed Reflex save, a target in heavy metal armor becomes staggered.
      A target in light or medium metal armor instead becomes entangled. Targets
      wearing no armor or nonmetallic armor are unaffected. If the target is
      wearing heavy metal armor and succeeds at its Reflex save, it becomes
      entangled instead of staggered; a target in light or medium metal armor
      that succeeds at its saving throw is unaffected by the spell.</p>
