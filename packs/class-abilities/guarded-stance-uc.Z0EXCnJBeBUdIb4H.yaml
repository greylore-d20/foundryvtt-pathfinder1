  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian can take on a more defensive posture. This grants her a
      +1 dodge bonus to her Armor Class for the duration of her current rage.
      This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has.</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>

      <p>Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A barbarian can’t have
      more than one stance rage power active at a time. If she activates a
      stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance
      immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning
      of the barbarian’s turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the
      rage ends.</p>
