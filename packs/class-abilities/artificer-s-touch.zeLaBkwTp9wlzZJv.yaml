  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.24zg8a05hqum3e6j]{Mending} at will,
      using your cleric level as the caster level to repair damaged objects. In
      addition, you can cause damage to objects and construct creatures by
      striking them with a melee touch attack. Objects and constructs take 1d6
      points of damage +1 for every two cleric levels you possess. This attack
      bypasses an amount of damage reduction and hardness equal to your cleric
      level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Wisdom modifier.</p>
