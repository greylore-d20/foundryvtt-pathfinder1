  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging and mounted, the barbarian’s mount gains DR/magic equal to
      1/2 the barbarian’s level. The mount’s natural weapons count as magical
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this
      rage power.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
