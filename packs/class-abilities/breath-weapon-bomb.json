      "value": "<p>Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from the alchemist’s bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligent modifier) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
