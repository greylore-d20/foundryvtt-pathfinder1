  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You animate an area of rubble, gravel, or other small stones, creating
      a dangerous, rolling area of debris. The animated rubble has a space of 10
      feet and acts like a swarm, damaging (1d6 hit points) and distracting (DC
      12) anything within it. As a move action, you can direct the rubble to
      move up to 10 feet. If the rubble is attacked, treat it as a Medium
      animated object with the young creature simple template and the swarm
      subtype.</p>
