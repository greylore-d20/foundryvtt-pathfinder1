    <p>This spell enables you to make a <i>snare</i> that functions as a magic
    trap. The <i>snare</i> can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope.
    When you cast <i>snare</i> upon it, the cordlike object blends with its
    surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character with the trapfinding
    ability to locate). One end of the <i>snare</i> is tied in a loop that
    contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside
    the circle.</p><p>If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the <i>snare</i>
    can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when
    the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped
    and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree
    is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no
    damage but causing it to be entangled.</p><p>The <i>snare</i> is magical. To
    escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23
    Strength check that is a full-round action. The <i>snare</i> has AC 7 and 5
    hit points. A successful escape from the <i>snare</i> breaks the loop and
    ends the spell.</p>
