      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of death. Once per round, she can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.n390v9tbwxya1tz4]{Bleed} or @Compendium[pf1.spells.fipqx43u5blpjsvo]{Stabilize} as a free action. If she is reduced to below 0 hit points, she automatically stabilizes. She can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.8uwmrygxgih1fb57]{Animate Dead} at will without paying a material component cost, although she is still subject to the usual Hit Dice control limit.</p>\n<p>Once per day, she can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.51ob5y7phwlhcuzz]{Power Word Kill}, but the spell can target a creature with 150 hit points or fewer.</p>"
