      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can touch a diseased creature and exacerbate its condition. If it fails a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier), the creature takes damage as though it had failed its Fortitude save against the disease and any remaining onset time for the disease ends. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one additional time per day at 14th level and 20th level.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Death's Embrace power of the Death Domain or the Touch of Evil power of the Evil Domain.</p>"
