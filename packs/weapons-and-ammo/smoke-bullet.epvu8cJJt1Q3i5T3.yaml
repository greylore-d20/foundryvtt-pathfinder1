    value: >-
      <p>These sling stones require only a touch attack to succeed. When they
      strike a target, they burst, releasing a cloud of noxious gas that
      requires the creature struck to attempt a DC 13 Fortitude save. If the
      save fails, the target is nauseated for 2 rounds. A smoke bullets costs
      100 gp.</p>
