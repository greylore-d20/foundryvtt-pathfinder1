      <p>Often extracted from phosphorescent insects, tiny marine plants, or
      subterranean fungi, glowing ink emits a faint but steady light (typically
      red or green) that allows you to read it in normal darkness-this includes
      darkness created by spells like darkness, but not the supernatural
      darkness created by deeper darkness. If there is glowing ink on an object,
      you have a +2 bonus on Perception checks to locate it. Mixing glowing ink
      with marker dye makes the dye glow in the dark until it fades.</p>
