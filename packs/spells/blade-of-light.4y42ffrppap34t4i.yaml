  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell infuses a weapon with pure sunlight (the weapon need not be
      a bladed weapon). A weapon enhanced by this spell sheds light as if
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.7x2z0i8rcx7s81fk]{daylight} had been cast
      on it. It functions as a magic and good weapon for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction. The weapon grants a +2 sacred bonus on attack
      rolls against undead and deals +1d6 points of damage on a successful hit
      against such foes; against incorporeal undead, it functions as if it had
      the <em>ghost touch</em> weapon special ability. The weapon automatically
      confirms critical hits against foes that are vulnerable to sunlight.</p>
