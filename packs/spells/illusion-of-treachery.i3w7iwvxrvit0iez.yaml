    value: >-
      <p>You create an illusion that takes the same space as a foe and mimics
      its movements perfectly. Whenever you cast a spell or throw a weapon, the
      illusion ceases mimicking the target's actions just long enough to make it
      look like the target cast the spell or threw the weapon simultaneously
      with you, such that witnesses who can see both you and the target can't
      tell with certainty who truly cast the spell or threw the weapon.
      Witnesses who can see only the target see it as the only apparent source.
      The subject of this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from
      these illusory actions. Each target of the attack or spell counts as
      interacting with the illusion and thus receives a save to disbelieve.</p>
