      <p>This bomb crushes the target like a
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.tdevhSAiiOchinl7]{void bomb},
      then repels nearby creatures with a burst of gravity. The target takes
      damage as if hit by a void bomb. All other creatures within 5 feet of the
      target are subject to a bull rush. The alchemist uses his alchemist class
      level in place of his Combat Maneuver Bonus, and adds his Intelligence
      modifier in place of his Strength or Dexterity modifier to resolve the
      bull rush attempts. Creatures moved by a blackstar bomb are pushed
      directly away from the targetâ€™s square. An alchemist must have the void
      bomb discovery to create blackstar bombs.</p><hr
