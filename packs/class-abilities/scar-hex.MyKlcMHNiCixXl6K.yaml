  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This hex curses a single target touched with horrible scars of the
      witch's choosing, whether something as simple as a single letter on the
      target's forehead or blotchy, burnlike scars on his body. The target may
      make a Will save to resist this hex. These scars do not interfere with the
      target's senses or prevent it from using abilities, but may affect social
      interactions. They persist through disguises and shapechanging.</p><p>The
      witch can use her hexes on the scarred target at a range of up to 1 mile,
      and she is considered to have a body part from the target for the purpose
      of scrying and similar divination spells. The witch can withdraw this hex
      from a target as a move action at any range.</p><p>The number of
      supernatural scars the witch can maintain at once is equal to her
      Intelligence bonus ([[@abilities.int.mod]]); once she reaches this limit,
      she must remove the scar from a current victim in order to mark another.
      Effects that remove curses can remove the scar.</p>
