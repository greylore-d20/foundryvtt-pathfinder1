      <p>You emanate an aura that saps the strength of others of your kind and
      channels their energy into you. Each round that a creature starts its turn
      in the spell's area and shares both your creature type and at least one
      subtype you possess (if any), that creature must succeed at a Fortitude
      save or take 1d4 points of damage. You gain a number of temporary hit
      points equal to the amount of damage you deal with this spell (maximum 10
      + your caster level). These temporary hit points go away when the spell
      ends.  As long as you have at least 5 temporary hit points while this
      spell is in effect, you gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, saving
      throws, and skill checks. If you have 15 or more temporary hit points,
      this competence bonus increases to +2.</p>
