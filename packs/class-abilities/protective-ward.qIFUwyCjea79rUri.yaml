  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can create a 10-foot-radius field of
      protective magic centered on you that lasts for a number of rounds equal
      to your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. All allies in this area (including
      you) receive a +1 deflection bonus to their <em>Armor Class</em>. This
      bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. You can
      use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>
