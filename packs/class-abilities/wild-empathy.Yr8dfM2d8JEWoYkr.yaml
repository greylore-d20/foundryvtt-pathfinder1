    value: >-
      <p>A druid can improve the attitude of an <em>animal</em>. This ability
      functions just like a <em>Diplomacy</em> check made to improve the
      attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and
      her <em>Charisma</em> modifier to determine the wild empathy check
      result.</p>

      <p>The typical domestic <em>animal</em> has a starting attitude of
      indifferent, while wild <em>animals</em> are usually unfriendly.</p>

      <p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the <em>animal</em> must be able to
      study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one
      another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an <em>animal</em>
      in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take
      more or less time.</p>

      <p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an
      <em>Intelligence</em> score of 1 or 2, but she takes a â€“4 penalty on the
      check.</p>
