    value: >-
      <p>A <i>fireball</i> spell generates a searing explosion of flame that
      detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster
      level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area.</p><p>Unattended
      objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no
      pressure.</p><p>You point your finger and determine the range (distance
      and height) at which the <i>fireball</i> is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized
      bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a
      material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range,
      blossoms into the <i>fireball</i> at that point. An early impact results
      in an early detonation. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow
      passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must "hit" the opening with a
      ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates
      prematurely.</p><p>The <i>fireball</i> sets fire to combustibles and
      damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points,
      such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an
      interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the <i>fireball</i> may
      continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the
      barrier just as any other spell effect does.</p>
