  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell covers your hand with a writhing black aura. As part of
      casting the spell, you can make a melee touch attack that deals 2d6 points
      of negative energy damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1
      round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1
      minute instead. Creatures immune to precision damage are immune to the
      staggered effect.</p>
