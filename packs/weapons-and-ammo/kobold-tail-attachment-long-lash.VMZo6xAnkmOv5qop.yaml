      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Damage</strong> 1d4 (small), 1d6 (medium);
      <strong>Critical</strong> x2; <strong>Range</strong> -;
      <strong>Type</strong> S</p><p><strong>Category</strong> Light;
      <strong>Proficiency</strong> Special</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A kobold
      with the Tail Terror feat (see below) can slip this device over the tip of
      his tail to augment his natural attack. Each tail attachment provides just
      enough weight, balance, and striking power to increase the damage of his
      tail slap. It takes a full-round action to slip on a kobold tail
      attachment, and the kobold gains a +4 bonus against disarm attempts made
      to remove his tail attachment.</p><p>While a kobold is wearing a kobold
      tail attachment, the attack deals the tail attachment damage, and some
      attachments gain a special feature. Tail attachments are light weapons and
      can be improved by feats that can improve weapon attacks (such as Weapon
      Focus and Weapon Specialization). All kobold tail attachments make up a
      kobold tail attachment weapon group that can be improved by the fighter's
      weapon training class ability. Tail attachments can be constructed of
      special material and made into masterwork or magic items. There are five
      types of common tail attachments.</p><p><strong>Long Lash</strong>: This
      slender cord has tiny bits of glass and stone embedded in its length.</p>
