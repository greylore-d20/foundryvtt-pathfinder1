          <p>Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power.
          The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods
          and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and
          terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the
          intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is
          the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and
          covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders
          beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a
          particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers,
          others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all
          magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable
          of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world
          to their every desire.</p><p>Role: While universalist wizards might
          study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist
          wizards research schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled
          within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards
          are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming
          any danger.</p><h2>Class Skills</h2><p>The wizard’s class skills are
          Appraise (Int), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int),
          Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>

      class: wizard
      description:
        value: >-
          <p>At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a
          creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a <em>familiar</em> or
          a bonded object. A <em>familiar</em> is a magical pet that enhances
          the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a
          bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or
          to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is
          permanent and cannot be changed.</p>

          <p>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost.
          Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of
          the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These
          objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level
          are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or
          ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons
          must be held in one hand. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without
          his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a
          <em>concentration</em> check or lose the spell. The DC for this check
          is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet,
          it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.</p>

          <p>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that
          the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the
          spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast
          by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects
          dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by
          <em>metamagic feats</em> or other abilities. The bonded object cannot
          be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see
          <em>arcane school</em> below).</p>

          <p>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as
          if he has the required <em>Item Creation Feats</em> and if he meets
          the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a
          bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the
          dagger (see @Compendium[pf1.feats.4hNO4OAWYF5vXphH]{Craft Magic Arms
          and Armor} feat). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand
          abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed
          and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to
          craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including
          any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard
          who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced,
          the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the
          appropriate type.</p>

          <p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points
          the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an
          arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a
          special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the
          masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced
          in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the
          previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as
          his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or
          destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities
          while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded
          item.</p>

          <p>A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining
          additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be
          made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that
          does not select a school receives the <em>universalist</em> school
          instead.</p>

          <p>A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must
          select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing
          knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in
          another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must
          use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a
          wizard with <em>evocation</em> as an opposition school must expend two
          of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a
          @Compendium[pf1.spells.6oq1wcryviik9ice]{Fireball}. In addition, a
          specialist takes a –4 penalty on any <em>skill checks</em> made when
          crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition
          schools as a prerequisite. A <em>universalist</em> wizard can prepare
          spells from any school without restriction.</p>

          <p>Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In
          addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each
          spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can
          prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell
          must be in the wizard’s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell
          modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it
          uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the
          <em>universalist</em> school do not receive a school slot.</p>

          a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated as a ranged attack with a
          thrown weapon, except that you add your Intelligence modifier on the
          attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier (damage still relies on
          Strength). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver.

          you must use an additional daily usage for each level above 1 that the
          feat adds to the spell. Even though this ability does not modify the

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.</p><p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</p><p>Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.</p><p>Spells such as <i>bless</i> that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.</p><p><i>Invisibility</i> can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>"

          <p>This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit
          your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely
          locate and attack you.</p><p>When <i>mirror image</i> is cast, 1d4
          images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images
          total) are created.</p><p>These images remain in your space and move
          with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly.
          Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires
          an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of
          your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see
          whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment,
          the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of
          your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you
          normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects
          that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not
          destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are
          harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.</p><p>An attacker
          must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or
          the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal
          miss chances still apply).</p>

          <p>You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed
          depends on how long you study a particular area or
          subject.</p><p><i>1st Round</i>: Presence or absence of magical
          auras.</p><p><i>2nd Round</i>: Number of different magical auras and
          the power of the most potent aura.</p><p><i>3rd Round</i>: The
          strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing
          the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill
          checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one
          check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a
          nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can
          attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).</p><p>Magical
          areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may
          distort or conceal weaker auras.</p><p><i>Aura Strength</i>: An aura's
          power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster
          level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one
          category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the
          two.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="2">Spell or Object</th><th
          colspan="4">Aura Power</th></tr>
          <tr><th>Faint</th><th>Moderate</th><th>Strong</th><th>Overwhelming</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Functioning spell (spell level)</td><td>3rd or
          lower</td><td>4th-6th</td><td>7th-9th</td><td>10th+

          or lower</td><td>6th-11th</td><td>12th-20th</td><td>21st+
          (artifact)</td></tr></tbody></table> <i>Lingering Aura</i>: A magical
          aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a
          spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If <i>detect
          magic</i> is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates
          an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the
          aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:
          <table><tbody><tr><th>Original Strength</th><th>Duration of Lingering
          Aura</th></tr> <tr><td>Faint</td><td>1d6 rounds</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Moderate</td><td>1d6 minutes</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Strong</td><td>1d6x10 minutes</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Overwhelming</td><td>1d6 days</td></tr></tbody></table>
          Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they
          are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can
          turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers,
          but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or
          3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.<p></p><p><i>Detect magic</i> can be

          <p>This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding

          increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up

          normal light). In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no
          effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable
          object.</p><p>You can only have one light spell active at any one
          time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect,
          the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent
          (through permanency or a similar effect), it does not count against
          this limit. Light can be used to counter or dispel any darkness spell
          of equal or lower spell level.</p>
