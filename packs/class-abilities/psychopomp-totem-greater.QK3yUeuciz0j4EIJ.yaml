    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian can detect and locate undead creatures
      within 30 feet, just as if it had the blindsight ability, and any weapons
      she wields are treated as if they had the ghost touch special ability.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the psychopomp totem rage power and be at least
      10th level to select this rage power.</p>
