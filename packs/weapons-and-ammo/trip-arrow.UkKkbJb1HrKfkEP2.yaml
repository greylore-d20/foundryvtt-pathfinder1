      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This squat arrow has a large, bulbous metal tip that expands and
      flattens in flight. If you hit a creature with a trip arrow, the arrow
      deals no damage but <b>performs a trip combat maneuver</b> against the
      target with a <b>CMB of +5</b>.</p>

      <p>For the purpose of determining Combat Maneuver Bonuses or penalties
      based on size, the arrow is treated as if it were the size of the creature
      it was designed for.</p>
