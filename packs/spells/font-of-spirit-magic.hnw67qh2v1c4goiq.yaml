  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You amplify the effect of magic associated with your spirit and your
    wandering spirit (any spells on the spirit magic spell lists for these
    spirits). When allies within the area cast these spells, they gain a +2
    bonus on caster level checks and  concentration checks, as well as to spell
    DCs. This bonus is a sacred bonus if you are good-aligned or a profane bonus
    if you are evil-aligned; if you are neither good nor evil, you can choose
    what type of bonus the spell grants when you cast it.</p>
