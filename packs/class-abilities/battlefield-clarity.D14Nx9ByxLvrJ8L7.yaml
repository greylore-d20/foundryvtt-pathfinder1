    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever you fail a saving throw
      that causes you to become blind, deaf, frightened, panicked, paralyzed,
      shaken, or stunned, you may attempt that saving throw again, with a +4
      insight bonus on the roll. You must take the second result, even if it is
      worse.</p>

      <p>At 7th and 15th level, you can use this ability one additional time per
      day.</p>
