  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, any creature you are grappling or pinning is affected by
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.snspotd2cno49ed5]{Zone of Truth} (Will negates).
      Outside of combat, you may use this ability by touching a target with both
      hands. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your
      inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. The effect
      ends if you stop grappling, pinning, or touching the target.</p>
