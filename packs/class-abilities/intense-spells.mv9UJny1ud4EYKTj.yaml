  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, add
      1/2 your wizard level to the damage (minimum +1). This bonus only applies
      once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split between
      multiple missiles or rays. This bonus damage is not increased by
      <em>Empower Spell</em> or similar effects. This damage is of the same type
      as the spell. At 20th level, whenever you cast an evocation spell you can
      roll twice to penetrate a creatureâ€™s spell resistance and take the better
      result.</p>
