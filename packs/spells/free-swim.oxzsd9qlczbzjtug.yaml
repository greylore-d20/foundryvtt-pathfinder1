      <p>The target can move and attack underwater normally without the usual
      penalties involved with underwater combat, as if under the effects of
      <i>freedom of movement</i>. However, the target doesn't gain any
      protections against grapple, paralysis, and magical effects that impede
      movement (such as <i>solid fog</i>, <i>slow</i>, and web).</p>
