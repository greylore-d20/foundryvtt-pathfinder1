  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Your touch creates an invisible circle on a flat surface. Any outsider
    passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught within.
    Once trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard action to
    physically exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any form of
    extra<i>dimensional</i> travel (as per <i>dimensional</i> anchor). Contained
    outsiders can still attack adjacent creatures outside of the circle, or
    target others with ranged attacks, spells, and spell-like abilities. Despite
    the spell's name, <i>devil snare</i> captures outsiders of any type, not
    only devils.  As a standard action, you can dismiss the circle, expelling
    any outsiders still trapped within to their planes of origin (as per
    dismissal). An outsider can resist this effect with a successful Will save,
    enabling it to remain after the spell is dismissed.</p>
