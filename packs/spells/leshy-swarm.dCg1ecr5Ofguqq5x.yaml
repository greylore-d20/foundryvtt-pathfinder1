  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You call out to nearby nature spirits and grant them temporary plant
    bodies. These creatures are similar to leshys, except they are Tiny and far
    more simpleminded. The swarm uses the statistics for a rat swarm, except it
    does not carry a disease or have scent. The leshy swarm has darkvision with
    a range of 60 feet and is immune to electricity, mind-affecting effects,
    paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep effects, sonic, and stunning.</p><p>You
    can direct the leshy swarm to move up to its speed along a path for your
    choice by spending a standard action to communicate your desires through the
    spell, or by spending a move action if you can speak to creatures that
    understand only Druidic and Sylvan. The leshys are confused by their sudden
    possession of new bodies and assume that nearly any creature you direct them
    toward is a threat. They attack all creatures within their area except for
    you and other creatures with the plant type.</p>
