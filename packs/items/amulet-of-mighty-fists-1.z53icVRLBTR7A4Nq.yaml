  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This amulet grants an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and
      damage rolls with unarmed attacks and natural
      weapons.</p><p>Alternatively, this amulet can grant melee weapon special
      abilities, so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks. See Table:
      Melee Weapon Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities
      count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item,
      but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. An amulet of mighty fists
      cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus
      equivalents) higher than +5. An amulet of mighty fists does not need to
      have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special
      ability.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong>
