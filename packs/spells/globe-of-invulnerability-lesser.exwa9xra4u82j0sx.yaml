  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and
      excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of
      any such spells does not include the area of the <i>lesser Globe of
      Invulnerability</i>. Such spells fail to affect any target located within
      the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or
      spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast
      through or out of the magical globe.</p><p>Spells of 4th level and higher
      are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the
      globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a <i>dispel magic</i>
      spell. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.</p><p>Note
      that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe,
      and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.</p><p>If a given
      spell has more than one level depending on which character class is
      casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether
      <i>lesser Globe of Invulnerability</i> stops it.</p>
