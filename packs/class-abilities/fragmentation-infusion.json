Attempt a ranged attack roll against a target within 120 feet. If you hit, the target takes your kinetic blast damage with no saving throw. All other creatures and objects within a 20-foot burst take half the normal amount of damage and can attempt a Reflex save to reduce that damage by half again. If the attack misses its target, the blast has no effect. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p>"
