      "value": "<p>The exact effects of this revelation depend on whether you cast inflict or cure spells.</p>\n<p>If you cast inflict spells, these spells carry with them the taint of madness. Subjects who take damage from your inflict spells are also subject to&nbsp;confusion, as the spell, except the duration of this effect is a number of rounds equal to the level of the inflict spell. The save DC against this effect is 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you cast cure spells, these spells are potentially more effective but entirely in the target’s mind. Whenever you cast a cure spell, you can cast it as though it were enhanced with the Empower Spell metamagic feat by expending two spell slots, except these hit points are temporary. This does not increase the level of the spell. Hit points healed this way expire after a number of minutes equal to half your oracle level.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
