    value: >-
      <p>You curse the target to suffer a violent accident  within the next 24
      hours. You have no control over the form the accident takes or when it
      strikes. The target can avoid being cursed with spell resistance when you
      cast the spell, but otherwise receives no saving throw. Regardless of the
      accident's nature, it is magically empowered to deal an amount of damage
      equal to 1d8 x your caster level (maximum 5d8 points of damage), and the
      damage is of a type appropriate to the source of damage (such as fire for
      an explosion or bludgeoning for a falling object). When the accident
      occurs, the target can attempt a Reflex saving throw to reduce the damage
      by half. Although others might be surprised or inconvenienced by the
      accident, it damages only the target.</p>
