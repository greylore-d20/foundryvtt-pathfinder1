      <p>This spell functions like <i>scale spikes</i>, except that the spikes
      growing out of the scales have an enhancement bonus on attack and damage
      rolls equal to +1 for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does
      not allow the spikes to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.</p>
