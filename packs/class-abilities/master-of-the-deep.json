      "value": "<p>As a standard action, the barbarian commands an aquatic creature to do her bidding. The barbarian selects a creature with the aquatic type within 30 feet and gives a terse command from those listed in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=command\">command</a>&nbsp;spell. Alternatively, if the creature has an Intelligence of 1 or 2, the barbarian may instead command the creature to attack the closest creature to it as a standard action. The creature must succeed at a Will save (DC equal to 10 + half the barbarian’s level + her Strength modifier) or obey the command to the best of its ability on its next turn. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against master of the deep (successful or not), it is immune to this power for 24 hours. This ability is a mind-affecting effect, but it is not language dependent; the creature need not understand the barbarian giving the command.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.</p>"
