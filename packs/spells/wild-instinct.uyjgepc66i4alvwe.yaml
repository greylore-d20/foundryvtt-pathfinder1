  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell sharpens your senses, allowing you to perceive threats you
      would otherwise miss. You become aware of sounds and smells you would
      normally overlook, and even retain the ability to detect threats when
      soundly asleep. For the duration of the spell, you gain a +5 bonus on
      Perception checks to act in a surprise round. Additionally, you don't take
      a penalty on Perception checks while sleeping, and can choose to wake if
      you notice a threat while asleep.</p>
