A successful Fortitude save each round negates the Dexterity damage but not the cold damage.</p><p>Any creature that doesn't move on its turn becomes encased in a sheath of ice equivalent to <i>Wall of Ice</i>, is helpless, and cannot breathe. Corpses in the area for longer than 1 round are transmuted into solid ice; reviving the icy corpse requires <i>true resurrection</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. As a move action, you may move the area of effect up to 10 feet in any direction.</p>"
