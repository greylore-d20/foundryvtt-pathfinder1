  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can use the sound of your voice to lull a target
      creature into taking no action. This ability acts as the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.hk3xhc08blqzniv0]{Daze} spell, except it is
      language-dependent, has a duration of 1 round, and affects a living
      creature whose <em>Hit Dice</em> do not exceed your sorcerer level. You
      can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      <em>Charisma</em> modifier.</p>
