      "value": "<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, an omdura can select one divine infusion. Each infusion adds an effect to the omdura’s divine touch ability. The types of infusions available to the omdura are determined by the type of energy the omdura delivers with her divine touch. An omdura who delivers positive energy adds a mercy to her divine touch, treating her omdura level as her <em>paladin</em> level and her divine touch as the <em>paladin’s</em> <em>lay on hands</em> ability. An omdura who delivers negative energy adds a cruelty to her divine touch, treating her omdura level as her <em>antipaladin</em> level and her divine <em>touch</em> as the <em>antipaladin’s</em> touch of corruption ability. At 6th, 9th, and 12th level, she adds infusions to the list of those she can select as though she were a <em>paladin</em> or <em>antipaladin</em> (depending on her divine touch ability) of her omdura level. Divine infusion functions as either the cruelty or mercy class ability, depending on the omdura’s divine touch energy, for the purposes of feats, spells, or effects that work with those class features.</p>"
