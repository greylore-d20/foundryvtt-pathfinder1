  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Typically crafted from hollowed-out animal horn, but increasingly
      crafted from metal in a wide variety of shapes, a powder horn can hold up
      to 10 doses of @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.trucdntfxjdukrox]{black
      powder}. A powder horn protects black powder stored within in it from
      exposure to fire, electricity, firearm misfires, and water, and the narrow
      end of the horn is useful in funneling the expensive powder carefully into
      the barrel of a firearm.</p>
