      <p>Created by Ghorus when he was working to create the ghorans,
      <em>pinecone bomb</em> infuses a small pinecone with power, causing it to
      detonate with explosive force when thrown. You throw the pinecone at a
      target or point within range and it detonates immediately upon landing,
      dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage per 2 caster levels you have
      (maximum 5d6) to each creature caught in the spread.</p>
