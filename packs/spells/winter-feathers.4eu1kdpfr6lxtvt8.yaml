  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target's feathers thicken and fluff up to ward against winter's
      chill. The target suffers no harm from being in a cold environment, and
      can exist comfortably in conditions as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit
      without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature's equipment is
      likewise protected. This spell doesn't provide any protection from cold
      damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards associated
      with cold weather (such as slipping on ice, blindness from snow, and so
      on).  When you cast this spell, you may have the target's feathers turn
      white for the duration, granting it a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth
      checks to hide in ice and snow.</p>
