      "value": "<p>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast&nbsp;greater invisibility&nbsp;on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even&nbsp;invisibility purge,&nbsp;see invisibility, and&nbsp;true seeing&nbsp;can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3&nbsp;ki&nbsp;points from her&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.</p>"
