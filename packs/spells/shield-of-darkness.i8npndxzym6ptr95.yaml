  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You shield yourself with darkness, reducing the illumination level in
      your space to magical darkness and granting you total concealment. Your
      opponents are automatically aware of which squares you occupy, preventing
      you from attempting Stealth checks using this concealment unless every
      square adjacent to you has an illumination level of darkness or lower.
      <i>Shield of darkness</i> does not hinder your vision, and creatures that
      can see in magical darkness ignore this effect.</p>
