  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You touch a willing creature as a standard action, granting it a boon.
      A creature with this boon can, as a swift action, make a saving throw
      against a single spell or effect it is suffering from that grants a save.
      The DC of the saving throw is equal to the original DC of the spell or
      effect. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends. This boon
      lasts for 1 minute or until successfully used to remove a spell or effect,
      whichever duration is shorter. You can use this ability for a number of
      times equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p><p>This power replaces the
