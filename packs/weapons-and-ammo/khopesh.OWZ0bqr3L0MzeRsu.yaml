      convex curve near the end, making its overall shape similar to that of a
      battleaxe. A typical khopesh is 20 to 24 inches in length. Its curved
      shape allows the wielder to hook around defenses and trip foes. The
      elegant shape of a khopesh leads some artisans to cover them in ornate
      decorations.</p>
