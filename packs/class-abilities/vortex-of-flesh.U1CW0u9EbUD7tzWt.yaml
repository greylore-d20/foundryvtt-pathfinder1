  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you can momentarily change into an amalgam of erratic
      geometric shapes once per day, lashing out at every creature in a
      20-foot-radius spread around you as a <em>standard action</em>. This
      attack deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage per
      <em>sorcerer</em> level. If you benefit from a spell or effect that allows
      you to overcome damage resistance with your <em>natural attacks</em> (such
      as <em>magic fang</em>), this attack ignores <em>DR</em> of the same type.
      Those caught in the area can attempt a <em>Reflex</em> saving throw (DC =
      10 + half your <em>sorcerer</em> level + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier)
      for half damage. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At
      20th level, you can use this ability three times per day.</p>
