  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can invoke this
      blessing as an immediate action. A wave of water blasts out from you at
      your attacker, attempting a bull rush combat maneuver check using your CMB
      but adding your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength modifier.</p>
