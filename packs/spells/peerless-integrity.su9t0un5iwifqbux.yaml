      <p><i>Peerless integrity</i> conceals the alignment of creatures from
      divination magic. All creatures within the spell's area, including you,
      appear to have lawful good auras for the purposes of divination spells and
      effects that reveal alignments (such as <i>detect law</i> and <i>see</i>
      alignmentUC), instead of their actual alignments. If the caster of such
      divination magic succeeds at a Will save, the caster recognizes whether
      the readings are true or false. Any creature under the effects of this
      spell gains a +2 circumstance modifier on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. 
      This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (such as
      <i>detect thoughts</i> or <i>discern</i> lies) and does not protect
      against spells or effects that cause harm based on targeted creatures'
      alignments.</p>
