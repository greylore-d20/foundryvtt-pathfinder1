  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.1os71jpk7lrrl47b]{song of
    discord} except that affected creatures automatically attack the nearest
    target each round. In addition, all affected creatures gain a +4 morale
    bonus to Strength for the duration of the spell. A creature that succeeds at
    the Will save reduces the effectâ€™s duration to 1 round.</p>
