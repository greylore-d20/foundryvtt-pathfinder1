  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the
      senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching
      everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds
      per day equal to his summoner level. There is no range to this effect, but
      the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can
      end this effect as a free action.</p>
