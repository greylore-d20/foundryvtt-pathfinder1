      "value": "<p>Your chanting grants protection against your enemies. As a move action, you can begin chanting to gain the benefit of a protection spell (such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.skgjjub1hng29nwo]{Protection From Evil}) using your oracle level as your caster level. This protection lasts until you stop chanting or for the spellâ€™s normal duration, whichever comes first. Chanting after the initial round of the effect is a free action, and you can incorporate verbal components and communication into the chant; magical silence ends a chant and its protection effect.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can chant aloud to create a magic circle effect (such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.1i8b1v3dngkxj6jp]{Magic Circle against Evil}).</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>"
