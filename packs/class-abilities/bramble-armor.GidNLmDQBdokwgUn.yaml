  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you can cause a host of wooden thorns to burst from your
      skin as a free action. While bramble armor is in effect, any foe striking
      you with an unarmed strike or a melee weapon without reach takes 1d6
      points of piercing damage + 1 point per two cleric levels you possess. You
      can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric
      level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
