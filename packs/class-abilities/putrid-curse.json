Creatures who drink such a liquid are nauseated for 1 round (though potions and similar liquids still convey their usual benefits as well). Affected liquids remain stagnant for 1 hour after leaving your presence. @Compendium[pf1.spells.xi1uouy7qlpfaqlr]{Purify Food and Drink}&nbsp;can cleanse a stagnant potion or water with a successful caster level check (DC = 15 + double the potion’s caster level).</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you become immune to the nauseated effects created by liquids your presence has befouled.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, your body is covered in noxious slime, and each creature adjacent to you at the beginning of its turn must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your oracle level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened for 1 round.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, your slime coating grants you DR 10/—.</p>"
