      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      none</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> 10 uses; <strong>Usage</strong>
      disposable</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This wand-like device contains a
      reservoir at one end and a small pad at the other. A medlance can be
      filled with a single dose of liquid, such as a pharmaceutical, a potion,
      or a poison. It can then be used to administer the liquid to a creature-if
      the target does not wish to be injected with the medlance's contents, the
      wielder must succeed at a touch attack to dispense it as a standard
      action. Otherwise, administering liquid via a medlance is a move action. A
      medlance doesn't use charges, but after being used to administer 10
      injections, its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and the
      device becomes useless.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong>
