  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When an investigator succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a
      monsterâ€™s special powers or vulnerabilities, he can expend one use of
      inspiration as a swift action to grant allies within 30 feet that can hear
      him a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls against that monster or type of
      monster for 1 round.</p>

      <p>An investigator must be at least 7th level to take this talent.</p>
