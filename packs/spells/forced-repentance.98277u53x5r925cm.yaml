    value: >-
      <p>You force an evil creature that does not have the evil subtype to
      momentarily reflect on its past actions and be overcome by grief and
      conscience. The target immediately drops prone and begins to loudly
      confess all of its sins and transgressions to the caster for the duration
      of the spell. The spell immediately ends if you move out of line of sight
      or if the target is attacked.</p>
