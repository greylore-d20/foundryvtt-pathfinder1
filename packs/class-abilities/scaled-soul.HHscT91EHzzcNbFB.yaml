      assume the form of a <em>reptilian humanoid</em> (as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.kouqz0pm1xl8xilm]{Alter Self} ) or snake of
      Diminutive to Huge size (as @Compendium[pf1.spells.w88ddxpu89qcr5c0]{Beast

      somatic spell <em>components</em> when transformed. You also become immune
      to poison and <em>paralysis</em>. You may use serpentâ€™s fang as often as
