      "value": "<p>When a creature within 30 feet rolls for an attack, a save against a fear effect, or a skill check, you can flood its mind with a feeling of hopelessness as an immediate action before the roll is made. The target takes a –1 penalty on the roll. The penalty increases by 1 for every 6 psychic levels you have beyond 1st, to a maximum of –4 at 19th level. If the target fails its attack roll, save, or skill check, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.</p>"
