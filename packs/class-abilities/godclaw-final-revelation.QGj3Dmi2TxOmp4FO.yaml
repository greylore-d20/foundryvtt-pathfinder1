  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon reaching 20th level, you can cast detect chaos, detect law, and
      discern lies at will as spell-like abilities, using your oracle level as
      your caster level. You no longer take armor check penalties for wearing
      armor, and your armorâ€™s maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 5. Once per
      day, you can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.1zyixa5b6aw7npub]{Crushing Hand}
      as a spell-like ability without requiring a focus component, treating your
      oracle level as your caster level. This hand manifests as a massive,
      spiked gauntlet.</p>
