    value: >-
      <p>You instill the target with the ability to withdraw small items from
      her pockets or packs with supernatural swiftness. When the target
      retrieves an item stored on itself, it can retrieve  the item either as a
      move action without provoking attacks of opportunity, or as a swift action
      that provokes attacks of opportunity. This effect functions only when the
      target attempts to retrieve a stored item that weighs less than 1 pound
      per caster level (maximum 15 pounds).</p>
