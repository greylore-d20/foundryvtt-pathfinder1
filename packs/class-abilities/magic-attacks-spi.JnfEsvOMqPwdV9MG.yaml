    value: >-
      <p>When the phantom manifests in ectoplasmic form, it treats its slam
      attacks as if they were magic for the purposes of overcoming damage
      reduction.</p>

      <p>If the spiritualist is 10th level or higher, all of the phantomâ€™s
      weapons are treated as the alignment of the phantom for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.</p>
