    value: >-
      <p>You transform the target into a cheap alcohol of your choice, such as
      beer, grog, mead, rum, or wine. The alcohol doesn't taste good, but it's
      drinkable and just as effective as normal alcohol in making creatures
      inebriated (<i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> 237). This spell
      doesn't work on holy water, potions, magical liquids, or water that is
      part of a creature.</p>
