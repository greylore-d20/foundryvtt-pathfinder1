      "value": "<p>This dwarf-forged armor features layers of overlapping plates molded to deflect projectiles—especially those from firearms. Whenever you are the target of a ranged weapon attack that would ignore your armor bonus to AC, you add half the fortress plate’s armor bonus (including enhancement bonuses) to your AC against that attack. This benefit does not apply to energy attacks or magical touch attacks such as rays. Because the armor is designed with dwarves in mind, If you have the dwarf’s weapon familiarity racial trait, you increase this projectile-only bonus by 1. Fortress plate is incredibly bulky, and its armor category can’t be reduced by any effect (including by special materials, such as mithral). Fortress plate includes gauntlets and a helm.</p>"
