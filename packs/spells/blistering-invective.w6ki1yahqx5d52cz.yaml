    value: >-
      <p>You unleash an insulting tirade so vicious and spiteful that enemies
      who hear it are physically scorched by your fury. When you cast this
      spell, make an Intimidate check to demoralize each enemy within 30 feet of
      you (see page 99 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook). Enemies that
      are demoralized this way take 1d10 points of fire damage and must succeed
      at a Reflex save or catch fire. Spell resistance can negate the fire
      damage caused by this spell, but does not protect the creature from the
      demoralizing effect.</p>
