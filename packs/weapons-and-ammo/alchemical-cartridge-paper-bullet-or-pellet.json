There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p>\n<p><b><em>Paper Cartridge</em></b>: (<b>Source</b> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</em>) This simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet increases the misfire value by 1.</p>"
