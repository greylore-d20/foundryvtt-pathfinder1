      <p>When staked down with eight pitons (four on each side of the gap), this
      <em>rope</em> and slat bridge can support up to 1,500 pounds and span a
      30-foot gap. It rolls up into a parcel that can be carried slung over the
      back or by a pack animal. Convincing an animal to cross a portable bridge
      requires the come or heel trick.</p>
