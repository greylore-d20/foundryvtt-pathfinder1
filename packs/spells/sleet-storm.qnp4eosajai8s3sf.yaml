  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes
      the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through
      the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check.
      Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more
      means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details).</p><p>The sleet
      extinguishes torches and small fires.</p>
