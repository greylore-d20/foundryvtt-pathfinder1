      "value": "<p>At 8th level, the cavalier can inspire brutal malice among his allies. As a swift action, the cavalier can allow allies within 30 feet to deal nonlethal damage with their weapons without taking the usual â€“4 penalty (the weapon must still be capable of dealing nonlethal damage). Affected allies gain a +2 bonus on nonlethal weapon damage rolls. This effect lasts for 1 round and can be used once every 5 minutes.</p>"
