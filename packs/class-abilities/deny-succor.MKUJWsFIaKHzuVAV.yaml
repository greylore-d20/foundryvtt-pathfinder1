      <p>The shaman can place this hex on a single creature within 30 feet. The
      target does not heal damage from cure spells and does not benefit from any
      spells or effects that remove conditions. This effect lasts for a number
      of rounds equal to 1/2 the shamanâ€™s level. A successful Will saving throw
      negates this effect.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the saving throw is successful, the creature cannot be
      the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
