    value: >-
      <p>You, or a willing creature you touch, lay down a trail of scents that
      only the creatures you designate at the time of can detect. These
      creatures find it very easy to follow this trail.</p><p>They gain a +20
      competence bonus on any Survival checks made for the purpose of tracking
      the creature laying this trail.</p><p>Subject creatures with the scent
      special ability gain a +10 competence bonus on Wisdom or Survival checks
      to follow the trail.</p><p>In addition, you can leave scent messages along
      the trail.</p><p>Each word or emotion in this message requires spending a
      move action in the same spot. Subject creatures seeking to understand this
      message must make another DC 20 Survival check, with a -1 penalty for
      every word or emotion in the message, in order to understand it. Creatures
      cannot benefit from this smell if they cannot use, or do not have, a sense
      of smell. Creatures can use this spell to backtrack through a dungeon,
      maze, or similar areas even if the creature laying down the trail crossed
      over the spot multiple times.</p>
