    value: >-
      <p>Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round
      thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt
      of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of
      lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you
      choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time).
      Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is
      affected.</p><p>You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other
      actions, even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the
      first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a
      bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level
      (maximum 10 bolts).</p><p>If you are outdoors and in a stormy area-a rain
      shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado
      (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least
      Large size)-each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of
      3d6.</p><p>This spell functions indoors or underground but not
      underwater.</p>
