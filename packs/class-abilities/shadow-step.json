You can travel up to 30 feet per wizard level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps.

Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when you arrive, you re-enter 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown splash weapons (see page 202 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).
