      <p>You must have a melee weapon in hand to cast this spell.</p><p>On a
      successful melee attack, your weapon resounds with a thunderous clash. The
      target takes 1d6 points of sonic damage. Your weapon is not harmed by this
      attack.</p><p>If you are using your judgment ability or smite ability
      against the target, it is staggered for 1 round on a successful attack. A
      successful Fortitude save negates the staggering effect.</p><p>On a
      successful critical hit, the target is stunned for 1 round and deafened
      for 1d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the stunning and
      deafening effects. If you are also using judgment or smite, your foe makes
      only a single save against all effects.</p><p>This spell immediately ends
      if your weapon leaves your hand.</p><p><i>Resounding blow</i> stacks with
      the <i>thundering</i> weapon property.</p>
