      <p>This toadstool's pale-gray cap is stippled with yellow spots. Its
      presence often indicates ley lines or <em>fey</em> bowers nearby.</p>

      <p><b>Gather</b> DC 20; <b>Yield</b> 1 dose</p>

      <p><b>Terrain</b> any near ley lines</p>

      <p><b>Preparation</b> A fairy cap must be gently simmered (not boiled) in
      a mixture of water and other natural ingredients for 1 hour; this requires
      a successful DC 20 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check. At the end of this
      preparation time, the yellow spots' color changes to bright orange or dark
      brown-there's a 50% chance of either development.</p>

      <p><b>Use</b> When eaten without proper preparation, a fairy cap is mildly
      poisonous (save <em>Fort</em> DC 13, onset 1 minute, frequency 1/minute
      for 6 minutes, effect <em>nauseated</em> for 1 minute, cure 1 save), but
      when properly prepared, it takes on a not-unpleasant tangy flavor. The
      final color of a properly prepared fairy cap's spots determines its effect
      when consumed. A cap with orange spots causes a Large or smaller creature
      to grow one size category, while one with brown spots causes the eater to
      shrink one size category. These effects function as per <em>enlarge
      person</em> or <em>reduce person</em>, except they can affect any Large or
      smaller living creature; the effects persist for 10 minutes in either
      case. Whether or not it is prepared, a fairy cap is quite chewy, and
      eating it is a <em>full-round action</em>.</p>
