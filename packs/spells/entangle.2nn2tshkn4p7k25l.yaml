      <p>This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around
      creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures
      that fail their save gain the <i>entangle</i>d condition. Creatures that
      make their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must
      save again at the end of your turn. Creatures that move into the area must
      save immediately. Those that fail must end their movement and gain the
      <i>entangle</i>d condition. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free
      as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for
      this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is
      considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.</p><p>If the plants
      in the area are covered in thorns, those in the area take 1 point of
      damage each time they fail a save against the <i>entangle</i> or fail a
      check made to break free. Other effects, depending on the local plants,
      might be possible at GM discretion.</p>
