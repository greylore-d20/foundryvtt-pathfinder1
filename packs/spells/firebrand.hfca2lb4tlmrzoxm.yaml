    value: >-
      <p>You mark several allies with a flaming rune. This rune does not cause
      damage, and sheds light as if it were a torch. While the <i>firebrand</i>
      burns, any creature it marks is immune to damage from any fire spell you
      cast. All of the target's weapons (both natural and manufactured) inflict
      +1d6 points of fire damage on a hit (this bonus fire damage stacks with
      any amount of fire damage a creature's weapons might already inflict). At
      any point during the spell's duration, a creature bearing a
      <i>firebrand</i> can launch a beam of fire at any target within 30 feet as
      a swift action. This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals
      6d6 points of fire damage. Once a creature uses its <i>firebrand</i> to
      fire a ray in this manner, the effects of the spell end for that
      creature.</p>
