      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.emzBKDFNkNnC7N8u]{Perform}
      skill associated with a musical instrument (keyboard, percussion, string,
      or wind), you must have an appropriate musical instrument; otherwise you
      can't use the skill. The listed cost and weight is for a typical small
      instrument you could carry by hand, such as a drum, lyre, bell, harp, or
      flute; larger instruments such as a cello or piano are of course larger
      and more expensive.</p>
