      <p>Once during this spell's duration, you can spit a viscous liquid as a
      standard action. This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do
      not have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to
      counteract this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to
      break the adhesive, or to cast a spell) use the spell's DC rather than a
      tanglefoot bag's normal DCs. The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after
      you spit it.</p>
