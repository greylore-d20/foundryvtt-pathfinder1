      "value": "<p>When the psychic undercasts a spell (see page 144), she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell’s effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can’t use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows&nbsp;mind thrust III&nbsp;but not&nbsp;mind thrust IV&nbsp;could cast&nbsp;mind thrust II&nbsp;and spend 2 points to treat it as&nbsp;mind thrust III, but couldn’t spend 4 points to treat it as&nbsp;mind thrust IV.</p>\n<p>This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast.</p>"
