  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage
    rolls, 1d6 temporary hit points, and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws
    against fear effects and to the DC of  Intimidate checks attempted against
    her. Once per round, the target can select one other creature to gain this
    bonus as well. The chosen creature can be no farther from the target than 25
    feet + 5 feet for every 2 caster levels you possess, and a creature can't be
    selected more than once in this way. Such allies gain only the bonuses and
    temporary hit points; they don't continue to spread it to other creatures.
    The additional creatures' bonuses and temporary hit points share the
    original spell's duration, so when that duration ends, all affected
    creatures lose their bonuses and any remaining temporary hit points from
    this spell.</p>
