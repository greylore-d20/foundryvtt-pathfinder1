  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind. The
      subject is never checked or blown away by strong winds of windstorm or
      lesser strength (whether natural or magically created), and ranged attack
      rolls against the subject take a -4 penalty. Tiny or smaller creatures
      must succeed at a Fortitude save to successfully touch or attack the
      subject in melee. Failure knocks the attacker prone and pushes it 5 feet
      away from the subject per level of the caster. This movement can pass
      through the squares of other creatures without affecting them and does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity, but the creature takes 3d6 points of
      nonlethal damage, plus 1d6 if the creature strikes a solid object that
      blocks its movement.</p>
