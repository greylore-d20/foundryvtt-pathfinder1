  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a standard action
      to charge his free hand with energy. He can make a melee touch attack with
      that hand as a free action as part of activating this ability. If the
      touch attack hits, it releases the charge and deals 2d6 points of energy
      damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when he spends the arcane
      pool point to activate this ability). He can use this ability with the
      spellstrike class feature. If he misses with this attack, he can hold the
      charge for up to 1 minute before it dissipates.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, the amount of damage
      dealt by this attack increases by 1d6.</p>
