  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist’s fey mutagen now grants a +6 alchemical bonus to
      Dexterity and Charisma, a –2 penalty to his Strength, DR 10/cold iron, and
      the <a href="https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Druid">druid’s
      woodland stride class feature</a>. In addition, he can choose not to allow
      spells and effects to affect him if they would not be capable of affecting
      both his original creature type and the fey creature type. An alchemist
      must be at least 16th level and must have the greater fey mutagen
      discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
