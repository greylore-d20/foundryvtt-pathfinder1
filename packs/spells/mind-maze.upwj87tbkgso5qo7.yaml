  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell causes the target to act as though it's wandering through a
    maze. While under the effects of the spell, the target can't make attacks or
    cast spells and must take at least one move action each round to walk in a
    random direction determined using the guidelines for missed splash weapons
    (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 202). The target must move at its maximum speed during
    this required movement, though additional move actions after the first can
    cover shorter distances. If this movement takes the target into a dangerous
    area, such as through a threatened square or off a ledge, the target
    receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril.
    Walking into a harmless obstacle, such as a wall, ends the target's
    movement.</p>
