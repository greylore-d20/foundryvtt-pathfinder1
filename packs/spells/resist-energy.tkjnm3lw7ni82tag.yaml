  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This abjuration grants a creature limited <i>protection</i> from damage
      of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity,
      fire, or sonic. The subject gains <i>resist energy</i> 10 against the
      energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to
      such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is
      reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points.
      The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th
      level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the
      recipient's equipment as well.</p><p><i>Resist energy</i> absorbs only
      damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side
      effects.</p><p><i>Resist energy</i> overlaps (and does not stack with)
      <i>protection from energy</i>. If a character is warded by <i>protection
      from energy</i> and <i>resist energy</i>, the <i>protection</i> spell
      absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.</p>
