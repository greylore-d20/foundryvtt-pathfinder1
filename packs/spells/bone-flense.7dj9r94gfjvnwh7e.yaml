    value: >-
      <p>Choose a creature that you can see. When that creature is struck by a
      weapon wielded by a member of the Red Mantis, a sawtooth sabre, or by the
      claw of a giant mantis, the bone nearest to the wound instantly sprouts
      jagged, razor-sharp spurs that flense the muscle and flesh from the inside
      out unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. The creature takes 1d6
      points of piercing damage per caster level. While the bone returns to
      normal immediately after dealing damage, the creature takes 1d4 points of
      bleed damage for 1 round per 2 caster levels. The victim is sickened by
      the pain for the duration of the bleeding. If the target creature has no
      bones, this spell has no effect.</p>
