    value: >-
      <p>This ability represents the rogueâ€™s ability to wriggle free from
      magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue
      with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails
      her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same
      DC.</p>

      <p>She can attempt only one additional saving throw against any given
      effect using this ability.</p>
