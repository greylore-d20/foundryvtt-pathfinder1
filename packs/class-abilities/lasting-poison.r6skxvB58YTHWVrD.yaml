    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can apply poison to a weapon in such a way
      that it is effective for two successful attacks instead of one. The poison
      has a reduced effect, however, and saves made against the poison receive a
      +2 circumstance bonus. Applying poison in this way requires a full-round
      action, or a standard action if the character has the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.25YEZqTGeFCUSF3L]{swift poison}
      talent.</p>
