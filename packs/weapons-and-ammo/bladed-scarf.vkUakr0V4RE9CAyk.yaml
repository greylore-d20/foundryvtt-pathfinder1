      Groups</b> Flails</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Knowing that seductive
      performances can bring out the worst in watchers, some Varisians craft
      rows of razor-sharp blades into their scarves. The skill required in using
      such scarves effectively and not revealing their deadly nature makes them
      exotic weapons. If you are proficient with a bladed scarf, you deal 1d4
      points of slashing damage to any creature that makes a successful grapple
      check against you while you wield the scarf. You can use the Weapon
      Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength
      modifier on attack rolls with a bladed scarf sized for you, even though it
      isn't a light weapon.</p>
