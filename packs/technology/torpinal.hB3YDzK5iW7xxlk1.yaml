  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Torpinal is a serum that makes the injected subject more cooperative
      during interrogation. It has a 1-minute onset time. The effects of a
      single dose of torpinal can be resisted with a successful DC 12 Will
      saving throw. Additional dose can be used, and often are when the subject
      succeeds at a save against torpinal. Each dose administered within a
      1-minute period forces a new saving throw to resist the effects, with the
      DC increasing by 2 per additional dose (to a maximum of DC 22).</p><p>A
      victim that succumbs to torpinal becomes highly suggestible to revealing
      truthful information for 10 minutes. Whenever the victim is posed a
      question during this time, the victim must succeed at a Will saving throw
      (DC = the DC of the dose of torpinal the victim failed his saving throw
      against) to resist replying to the question in as truthful a manner as he
      can. The victim isn't compelled to follow any suggestions other than the
      one to answer questions truthfully. A victim under the effects of torpinal
      takes a -10 penalty on Bluff checks, making it difficult to lie even if
      successfully saving against the torpinal's ongoing effects. Torpinal is a
      poison and mind-affecting
      effect.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 25;
