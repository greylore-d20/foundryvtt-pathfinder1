    value: >-
      <p>The glass receptacle of this injector contains 1 dose of a
      bright-yellow serum. When injected into a creature (this is a standard
      action), the substance grants immunity to low radiation for 1 hour, and a
      +5 alchemical bonus on all saving throws against other radiation effects
      for that duration. In addition, it heals 1d4 points of Strength damage
      caused by radiation poisoning. Vitality serum cannot cure Constitution
      drain caused by radiation
      poisoning.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 25;
