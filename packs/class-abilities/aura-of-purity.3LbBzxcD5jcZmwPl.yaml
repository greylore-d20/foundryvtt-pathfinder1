  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch’s aura purifies the air around her. Diseases, inhaled
      poisons, and noxious gaseous effects (such as stinking cloud) are negated
      in a 10-foot aura around the witch for a number of minutes equal to her
      level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent
      in 1-minute increments. Effects caused by spells whose level is more than
      half the witch’s class level are unaffected.</p>
