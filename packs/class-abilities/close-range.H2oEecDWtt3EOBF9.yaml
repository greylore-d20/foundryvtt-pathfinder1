  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The magus can deliver ray spells that feature a ranged touch attack as
      melee touch spells. He can use a ranged touch attack spell that targets
      more than one creature (such as scorching ray), but he makes only one
      melee touch attack to deliver one of these ranged touch effects;
      additional ranged touch attacks from that spell are wasted and have no
      effect. These spells can be used with the spellstrike class feature.</p>
