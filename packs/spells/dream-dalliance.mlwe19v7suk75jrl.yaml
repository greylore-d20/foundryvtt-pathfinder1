    value: >-
      <p>You create a comforting phantasm, which leeches onto the psyche of a
      nearby target. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the
      phantasm from entering its psyche, but otherwise it takes up permanent
      residence in the creature's mind. The phantasm fills its target's dreams
      with happy visions, comforting manifestations of loved ones, and
      incredible vistas, feeding the target a perfect fantasy life it never
      wishes to leave. After the target's next night's sleep, the target must
      succeed at a Will saving throw to wake up; otherwise, it remains asleep
      for the rest of the day and following night. Each night it must succeed at
      a new saving throw or remain asleep for days or weeks on end as it slowly
      starves to death (presuming it normally needs to eat to survive). Loud
      noises, jostling, and even pain won't rouse the slumbering target. Dealing
      1 point of damage per the target's Hit Die awakens the target, but it
      awakens fatigued and takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against
      spells and effects that may put it back to sleep until the phantasm has
      been banished.  The phantasm remains in its host's mind indefinitely,
      requiring a new Will saving throw to wake up every time the target rests,
      until it is removed via <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>greater
      restoration</i>, or <i>miracle</i>. Alternatively, the phantasm can be
      confronted in its host's mindscape (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult
      Adventures</i> 202), where it manifests as a slothful duplicate of its
      host with identical abilities, skills, and attributes.</p>
