Each time the subject successfully strikes an opponent with a successful melee attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 morale bonus on attack rolls (maximum +4 bonus) and gains 1d8 temporary hit points (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points). If an attack misses, the attack bonus resets to +0 but any accumulated temporary hit points remain. The temporary hit points disappear at the end of the spell's duration.</p>"
