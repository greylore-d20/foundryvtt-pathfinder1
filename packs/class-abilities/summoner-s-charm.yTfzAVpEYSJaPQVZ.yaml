  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you cast a conjuration (<em>summoning</em>) spell, increase
      the duration by a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum
      1). This increase is not doubled by
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.btXWioB3SKJv8YEG]{Extend Spell}. At 20th level, you
      can change the duration of all <em>summon monster</em> spells to
      permanent. You can have no more than one summon monster spell made
      permanent in this way at one time. If you designate another <em>summon
      monster</em> spell as permanent, the previous spell immediately ends.</p>
