      <p>A folding shovel is a full-sized
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.tH7xOCWHHI1LwtUT]{shovel} with a sturdy
      sectional handle that folds into pieces no longer than the shovel blade,
      allowing it to fit in a smaller space such as a backpack. Converting the
      shovel from its folded state to usable (or vice versa) is 2 full-round
      actions.</p>
