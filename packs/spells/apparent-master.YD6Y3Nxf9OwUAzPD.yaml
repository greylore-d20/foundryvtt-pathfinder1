  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This charm makes a construct regard you as its master. The spell only
    affects mindless constructs that are attuned to the commands of a master,
    such as animated objects, golems, retrievers, and shield guardians. All
    constructs with Intelligence scores, even those that explicitly follow the
    commands of their creator, such as an homunculus, are unaffected. If the
    construct is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies it
    receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.<p>The spell enables you to control
    the construct completely, with the sole exception that commands directly
    resulting in damage break the spell. Any act by you or your apparent allies
    that damages the construct also breaks the spell. You can communicate your
    commands in any spoken language. The construct reverts to obeying the last
    commands given by its true master when the spell's duration expires.<p>If
    the construct's true master attempts to command a construct affected by
    <em>apparent master</em>, you must win an opposed Charisma check for the
    construct to continue to follow your commands. Failing this check breaks the
    spell.</p>
