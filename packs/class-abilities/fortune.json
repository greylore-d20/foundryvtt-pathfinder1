The target can call upon this good luck once per round, allowing him to reroll any ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better result. He must decide to use this ability before the first roll is made.</p>\n<p>At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round.</p>\n<p>Once a creature has benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.</p>"
