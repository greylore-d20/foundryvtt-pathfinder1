  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You animate one corpse that has been dead no more than 48 hours. It
      rises as a zombie (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 288) that is magically
      tethered to you and obeys your commands. As noted in <i>animate dead</i>,
      you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in
      total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level. 
      This spell disguises the zombie's appearance and allows you to control it.
      The zombie's outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if
      it were still alive. The zombie's normal staggered condition doesn't apply
      (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting
      the <i>flesh puppet</i> as a zombie without magic requires an opposed
      Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster
      level as a bonus on this Disguise check.  An ephemeral string connects you
      to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie
      and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to
      complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round,
      but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action.
      It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be
      ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can't make
      attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring
      constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is
      nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It
      has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet +
      10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie
      move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won't move out of
      range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the
      string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral
      string can pass through  physical barriers, but not barriers of magical
      force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.  When
      this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse.
      The spell ends automatically if you cast <i>flesh puppet</i> or <i>flesh
      puppet</i> horde on a new corpse.</p>
