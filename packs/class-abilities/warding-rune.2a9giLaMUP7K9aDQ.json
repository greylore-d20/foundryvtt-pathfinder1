Using this ability is an immediate action when a creature triggers one of your blast runes. The ability does not prevent you from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells or abilities. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one additional time per day at 14th level and 20th level.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Spell Rune power of the Rune Domain.</p>"
