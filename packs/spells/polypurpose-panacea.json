    "shortDescription": "<p>This creates one of several cantrip-level effects relating to your health, well-being, and entertainment. The panacea has no side effects (for example, the intoxication panacea does not cause a hangover). When you use <i>polypurpose panacea</i>, choose one of the following effects.</p><p>Analgesic: You do not feel minor aches and pains, such as from arthritis, a cold, or a hangover, for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 resistance bonus against pain-related spells.</p><p>Clarity: You get a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check within 1 minute. You must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.</p><p>Hallucination: You have pleasant hallucinations for 1 hour, such as wandering lights, music, playful surreal animals, and so on. You can tell these are not real, but they are distracting, and you take a -2 penalty on Perception checks for the duration.</p><p>Intoxication: You feel comfortably intoxicated for 1 hour, as if you had a few alcoholic beverages.</p><p><i>Lucid</i> Dream: If you take this panacea within 1 hour of going to <i>sleep</i>, you have a lucid dream that is under your control and lasts for an hour.</p><p>Resistance: You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saves for 1 minute.</p><p>Sleep: You enter a pleasant and restful <i>sleep</i> for at least 1 hour unless wakened. If you would normally begin <i>sleep</i>ing at this time, when the panacea ends you continue <i>sleep</i>ing normally.</p><p>Sobriety: You become completely sober for 1 hour, negating any penalties to your actions for being drunk (<i>GameMastery Guide</i> 237). Magical and alchemical methods (such as <i>detect</i> poison) still <i>detect</i> you as inebriated. Time spent under the effect of this panacea do not count toward the time necessary to sober up (it merely delays your intoxication).</p><p>Tenacity: You gain 1 temporary hit point for 1 minute.</p><p>Wakefulness: You remain awake for 2 hours without feeling <i>sleep</i>y, and without side effects such as jitteriness. You gain a +5 resistance bonus against <i>sleep</i>-related spells such as <i>lullaby</i> and <i>sleep</i>. This use of the panacea merely delays your need for <i>sleep</i> and does not count as rest or <i>sleep</i>. You can use it multiple times in succession, but as each effect wears off, you are as tired as you would be had you not used the panacea.</p>",
