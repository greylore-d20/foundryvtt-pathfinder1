  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You were exposed at a young age (perhaps even before you were born) to
      the alien species known as the hive, but this exposure did not result in a
      full-blown infestation by these otherworldly monsters. Others (including
      animals) find the unsightly spines and rough growths that periodically
      emerge from your flesh to be disturbing and distracting, and you take a â€“4
      penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, and Ride checks. Once per day
      as a standard action, you can cough up an ovoid, leathery sphere that can
      be hurled as a flask of acid, though it becomes inert after 24 hours.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, you gain the benefits of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.pau0ejk30fs1eebl]{Endure Elements} in hot
      environments and are immune to infestations (save for those from the hive
      itself ).</p>

      <p>At 10th level, your skin deformities grow numerous enough to increase
      your natural armor bonus by 1.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, you gain acid resistance 20.</p>
