      <p>This spell functions as <i>teleport</i>, except there is truly no range
      limit and you do not need to have seen your destination, though you must
      have a solid grasp of which world you wish to travel to ("the third planet
      from the sun" is an acceptable destination, but "a habitable world near
      that bright star" is not). If you have a specific location on a planet in
      mind, you arrive there without a chance of failure; otherwise you arrive
      at a location that would not immediately be life-threatening.</p><p>If no
      such safe landing zone exists on the world, such as someone attempting to
      travel into the sun without the proper precautions in place, the spell
      simply fails.</p>
