  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You imbue the target with a compulsion to avoid threats, enhancing its
    defensive instincts. So long as the affected creature  does not move closer
    to enemies during its turn, or moves at least 5 feet away from adjacent
    enemies, it gains a +1 morale bonus to its AC, and a +1 morale bonus on
    saves and on attack rolls made as readied actions and attacks of
    opportunity. Alternatively, if the affected creature does not close with its
    enemies, it can increase the DC of all spells it casts as part of a readied
    action by 1. If the subject of the spell willingly moves toward a
    threatening creature, the spell immediately ends.  While affected by
    coward's cowl, a creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against
    fear effects.</p>
