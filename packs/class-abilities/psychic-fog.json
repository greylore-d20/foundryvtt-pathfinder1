      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a cloud of fog. This fog lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. It functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud}, except it can’t be dispersed by wind.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus when creating this fog, causing it to become more tangible and function as @Compendium[pf1.spells.g0q8c0ni0rvipjpn]{Solid Fog}, except it doesn’t slow down any creature that has psychic powers or that can cast psychic spells. When you create a solid fog in this way, its duration is reduced to 1 round per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p>"
