    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to destroy any one robot in range. When you cast this
      spell, your hand crackles with electricity. You must succeed at a ranged
      touch attack to affect the target.</p><p>The target takes 12d6 points of
      damage + 1 point per caster level, or 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per
      caster level on a successful saving throw. A cyborg or android can be
      damaged by this spell, but takes half damage and gains a +4 bonus on the
      saving throw to resist the spell's effects.</p>
