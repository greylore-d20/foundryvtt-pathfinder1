      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.ptqu8gtrujxsvwy1]{teleport}, except you
      use it to <em>teleport</em> yourself or one other creature to a safe
      location you specify (the target can bring along objects as long as their
      weight doesn't exceed the target's heavy load). You can only send the
      target to a location with which you are very familiar. The target is first
      trapped in ice (hardness 0, 3 hit points per inch of thickness, 1 inch
      thick per caster level) for 1d4 rounds, during which time it is paralyzed,
      aware but unable to take any physical actions, and begins to fade away as
      the <em>teleport</em>ation aspect takes effect. At the end of the 1d4
      rounds, the target <em>teleport</em>s to the specified location, and the
      ice's hit points drop to 0 and it quickly melts away. If the ice is
      destroyed before the target <em>teleport</em>s, the spell ends and the
      <em>teleport</em> doesn't occur.</p>
