      <p>The arcanist can select a metamagic feat as a bonus feat. She must meet
      the prerequisites of this feat. Each morning, when she prepares her
      spells, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to
      exchange this bonus feat for another metamagic feat, as long as she meets
      the prerequisites of the new feat.</p>

      <p>The arcanist must have the metamagic knowledge exploit to select this
      exploit.</p>
