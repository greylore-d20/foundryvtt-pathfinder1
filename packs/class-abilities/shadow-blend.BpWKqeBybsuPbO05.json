The subject gains total concealment from all enemies (50% miss chance) as long as it remains within areas of dim or darker light. Against creatures with darkvision, the subject gains concealment (20% miss chance) rather than total concealment.</p>\n<p>Once triggered, this effect lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level or until the subject enters an area of normal or brighter light.</p>"
