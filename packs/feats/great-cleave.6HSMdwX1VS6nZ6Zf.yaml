    value: >-
      <i>You can strike many adjacent foes with a single blow.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, base attack bonus +4.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base
      attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage
      normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack
      bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and also within
      reach. If you hit, you can continue to make attacks against foes adjacent
      to the previous foe, so long as they are within your reach. You cannot
      attack an individual foe more than once during this attack action. When
      you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your
      next turn.</p>
