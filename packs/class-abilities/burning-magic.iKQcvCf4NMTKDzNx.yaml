  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and takes fire damage from one
      of your spells, it catches on fire. This fire deals 1 point of fire damage
      per spell level at the beginning of the burning creature's turn. The fire
      lasts for 1d4 rounds, but it can be extinguished as a move action if the
      creature succeeds at a Reflex save (using the spell's DC). Dousing the
      creature with water as a standard action grants a +2 bonus on this save,
      while immersing the creature in water automatically extinguishes the fire.
      Spells that do not grant a save do not cause a creature to catch on
      fire.</p>
