  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian can leave herself open to attacks while preparing
      devastating counterattacks. Enemies gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage
      rolls against the barbarian while sheâ€™s in this stance, but every attack
      against the barbarian provokes an attack of opportunity from her, which is
      resolved prior to each provoking attack.</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
