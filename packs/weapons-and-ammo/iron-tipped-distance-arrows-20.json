While these heads help them travel great distances, they make the arrows less effective at dealing damage.</p>\n<p>Iron-tipped distance arrows increase their bow's range increment by 10 feet but take a <strong>-1 penalty on damage</strong> dealt per range increment (minimum 1 point of damage).</p>\n<p>They are sold in leather quivers in quantities of 20.</p>"
