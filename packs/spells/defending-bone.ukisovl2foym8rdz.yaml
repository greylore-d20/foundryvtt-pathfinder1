  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You animate a bone with necromantic energy, giving it the power to float
    near your body and interpose itself against physical attacks. This gives you
    damage reduction 5/bludgeoning.</p><p>Once the bone has prevented a total of
    5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), it is destroyed and
    the spell is discharged. This spell has no effect if you have damage
    reduction from another source.</p>
