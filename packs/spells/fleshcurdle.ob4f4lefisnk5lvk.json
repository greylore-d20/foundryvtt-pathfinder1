When you cast this spell, you must choose one of three types of effects to inflict on the target-movement, attacks, or defense.</p><p><i>Attacks</i>: One of the creature's natural attacks takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls, only scores a critical hit on a natural 20, and only deals x2 damage on a confirmed critical hit.</p><p><i>Defense</i>: The creature's natural armor bonus decreases by -4, to a minimum bonus of +0.</p><p><i>Movement</i>: One of the creature's movement speeds (chosen by you) is halved.</p><p>Most undead are susceptible to <i>fleshcurdle</i>, but amorphous creatures and creatures without flesh are immune (such as elementals, oozes, plants, gaseous or incorporeal creatures, and skeletons).</p>"
