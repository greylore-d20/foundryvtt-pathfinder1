      <p>With their knowledge of the cyclical nature of existence, there are few
      experiences that can daunt samsaran slayers for long. As an immediate
      action when a slayer fails a saving throw against a fear effect, he can
      attempt the saving throw a second time to reduce the severity of the
      effect from panicked to frightened, frightened to shaken, or shaken to
      unaffected. Additionally, the DC of Intimidate checks to demoralize him
      increases by 2.</p>
