Spongestones are often used to deliver poison or burning oil. A flask of oil completely saturates 10 spongestones. When ignited (a free action if fire is available), a burning, oil-soaked spongestone deals +1d2 fire damage and can ignite combustible materials (such as a thatched roof ). Allowing a spongestone to burn in a sling's cup for more than 1d3 rounds gives the sling the broken condition.</p>"
