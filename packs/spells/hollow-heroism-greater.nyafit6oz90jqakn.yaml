      <p>This spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.z0duc2v2n3ioynta]{Greater Heroism}, except that you
      can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if
      you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the
      target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a -4 penalty on
      attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the spell's duration
      ends (no save), increasing to a -8 penalty against fear effects.
      Additionally, she takes damage equal to your caster level when you reverse
      the spell. Attempts to identify <em>greater hollow heroism</em> with a
      skill check incorrectly identify it as <em>greater heroism</em> (see the
      ruse descriptor on page 192).</p>
