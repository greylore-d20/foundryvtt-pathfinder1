If the second saving throw is successful, the barbarian is treated as if she succeeded at the first saving throw, negating or reducing the effect as determined by the spell or effect. If this second saving throw fails, the barbarian suffers the full effects of the spell or effect as normal.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p>"
