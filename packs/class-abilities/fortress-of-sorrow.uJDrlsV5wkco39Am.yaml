  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 13th level, you can mentally construct an extraplanar retreat on the
      Astral Plane. This ability functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.r4znakt4ukpebsxg]{Create Demiplane, Lesser} with a
      caster level equal to your psychic level, with the following adjustments:
      you need no focus to create the fortress of sorrow; the demiplane is
      permanent until dismissed by you; you cannot create more than one
      demiplane with this ability or add to the planeâ€™s area by casting the
      spell again; the light level on the demiplane is dim, though light sources
      affect it normally; and you cannot bring other creatures to your
      demiplane.</p>

      <p>Once per day, you can enter your demiplane (as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.q3st18udsalnyz5v]{Plane Shift}), and once per day,
      you can return in a similar manner, arriving at the same spot you left
      from (or the nearest available space).</p>
