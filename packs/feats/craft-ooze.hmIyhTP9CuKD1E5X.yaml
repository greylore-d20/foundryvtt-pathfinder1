      <p><strong>Source</strong> Alchemy Manual pg. 22</p><p><em>You can use
      alchemy to create dangerous ooze
      creatures.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Brew Potion, Craft
      Wondrous Item, Craft (alchemy) 3 ranks, caster level
      5th.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create living oozes as though
      they were magical items. Creating an ooze creature takes 1 day for each
      500 gp in its construction cost. To create an ooze, you must have access
      to an oozing vat (see below), you must use up raw materials worth the
      construction cost of the ooze, and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy)
      check (DC 10 + 2 × the ooze’s CR). A failed check ruins the materials
      used, while a check that fails by 5 or more also results in an ooze that
      attacks its creator for 1d4 rounds before dissipating into useless waste
      material. A newly created ooze has average hit points for its Hit Dice.
      Oozes created with this feat are mindless and uncontrolled, and even
      normally intelligent oozes like slithering trackers that are created this
      way have no Intelligence score—nor any loyalty to their
      creator.</p><p>While ooze creatures cannot normally be purchased in
      traditional marketplaces, GMs who wish to include such an option in their
      games—perhaps with oozes sold as black market commodities— need only
      double the construction cost of a specific ooze creature in order to
      figure out a fair market price.</p><p>The following table lists some of
      the most commonly crafted oozes and their creation requirements. At the
      GM’s discretion, other types of ooze creatures can be created with this
      feat. Creatures from Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, 3, or 4 are marked with a
      matching superscript.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Ooze</th><th>Construction
