  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A dire flail consists of two spheres of spiked iron dangling from
      chains at opposite ends of a long haft. This weapon excels at short but
      powerful strikes, and is typically swung in a constant churning motion.
      The wielder of a dire flail must have great strength, both to use the
      weapon effectively and to keep from tiring out.</p>
