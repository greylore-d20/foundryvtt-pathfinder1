    value: >-
      <p>You take a mental journey through the doors of perception to enter an
      altered state of consciousness. Despite this hallucinatory transmigration
      being entirely unreal, your mind and body fully react to it. You gain a +4
      alchemical bonus to a random ability score, as well as a corresponding -2
      penalty. If the bonus applies to Strength, the penalty applies to
      Intelligence, and vice versa. If the bonus applies to Dexterity, the
      penalty applies to Wisdom, and vice versa. If the bonus applies to
      Constitution, the penalty applies to Charisma, and vice versa. Each round
      as a standard action, you can explore the nooks and crannies of your
      imagination to further alter your corporal self. If you do so, attempt a
      Will save against the spell's save DC. If you succeed, randomly select
      another ability score and change the alchemical bonus and associated
      penalty accordingly. If you fail, you are dazed for 1 round instead as
      your mind reels from learning unexpected truths about yourself.</p>
