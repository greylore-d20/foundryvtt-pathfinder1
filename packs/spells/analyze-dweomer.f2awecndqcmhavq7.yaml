      <p>You can observe magical auras. Each round, you may examine a single
      creature or object that you can see as a free action. In the case of a
      magic item, you learn its functions (including any curse effects), how to
      activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if
      it uses charges). In the case of an object or creature with active spells
      cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster
      level.</p><p>An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this
      effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing
      about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object
      that makes its save cannot be affected by any other <i>analyze dweomer</i>
      spells for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Analyze dweomer</i> does not function when
      used on an artifact.</p>
