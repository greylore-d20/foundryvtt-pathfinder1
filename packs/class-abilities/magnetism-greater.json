This functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.oeemcnfjod9zd7my]{Repel Metal or Stone}, except only for metal objects, and you can also pull the objects toward you instead of pushing them away. The effect lasts for 1 round, and the pulling version of the effect canâ€™t pull objects into the air unless they are already airborne.</p>\n<p>You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 1 round per kineticist level you have.</p>"
