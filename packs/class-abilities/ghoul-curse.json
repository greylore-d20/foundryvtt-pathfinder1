You can only go without food for 12 hours before you begin to starve, and when you do starve, the DC of the Constitution check to avoid taking damage increases by 5. If you feed on fresh, raw flesh (no older than 1 hour) from a creature of your own race, you gain a +1 morale bonus on all saving throws for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you add @Compendium[pf1.spells.5u43heihlrtuc58y]{Ghoul Touch} to your list of 2nd-level oracle spells known.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you become immune to paralysis and disease.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you gain the effects of&nbsp;heroes’ feast&nbsp;whenever you feed on the raw flesh of a sentient creature, and the effects of this&nbsp;heroes’ feast&nbsp;double if the flesh you eat comes from a member of your own race (this effect applies no more often than once per day).</p>"
