      "value": "<p>At 4th level, an omdura can call on the powers of her god once per day to aid in her struggle against her enemies. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, the omdura chooses one target within sight to be the focus of her divine might. If the target is opposed to the omdura’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;on either the law/chaos or the good/evil axis, the omdura adds half her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;bonus (minimum +o) to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;and adds half her omdura level to damage rolls against the target of her divine might. A neutral omdura can choose any target to be the target of her divine might, but she adds only one­ third her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;bonus and omdura level.</p>\n<p>In addition, while divine might is in effect, the omdura gains a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus\">deflection bonus</a>&nbsp;equal to half her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (one-third for a neutral omdura) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the divine might. If a non­ neutral omdura targets a creature that is not opposed to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, the use of this ability is wasted with no effect.</p>\n<p>The divine might effect remains until the target of divine might is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;or the next time the omdura rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 9th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the omdura can use divine might one additional time per day to a maximum of four times per day at 19th level.</p>"
