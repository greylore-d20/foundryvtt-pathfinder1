      <p>Acting as divine warriors, omduras embody the tenets of their gods and
      serve as divine vessels. In the world of Asunda, omdura means “leader of
      souls” omdaris the masculine form and omdurais the feminine form. As Niobe
      is a woman, the feminine form of the class is used throughout this
      section. These mortals are granted greater purpose and are tasked with
      both spreading their god’s faith and defeating the faith’s enemies.
      Omduras are able to grant the same divine power they hold within
      themselves to others around them. This allows omduras to both defend
      others from enemies of their faith and inspire others to follow in their
      footsteps. Gods of all kinds select omduras to enact their will, though
      how this will is interpreted varies from omdura to omdura.</p>

      <p><b>Role:</b> Omduras’ divine abilities allow them to support their
      allies with spellcasting and the divine power of their gods. When fighting
      on their own, they call forth their god’s power to help them defeat their
      enemies, channeling a god’s divine force into mighty weapons.</p>

      <p>As their powers are influenced by their faith, all omduras must focus
      their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of omduras
      revere a specific deity (or multiple deities), a small number dedicate
      themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion-such as battle, death,
      justice, or knowledge-free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if
      you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.)</p>

      <p><b>Alignment:</b> An omdura’s <em>alignment</em> must be within one
      step of her deity’s.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8.</p>
