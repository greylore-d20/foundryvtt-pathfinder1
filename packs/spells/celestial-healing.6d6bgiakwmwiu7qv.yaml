      <p>You anoint a wounded creature with the blood of an outsider with the
      good subtype (such as an angel) or holy water, giving it fast healing 1.
      The target radiates the aura of a good creature for the duration of the
      spell and can sense the righteousness of the magic, though this has no
      long-term effect on the target's alignment. If the target has its own evil
      aura, this is not suppressed by celestial healing, and can also be
      detected normally.</p>
