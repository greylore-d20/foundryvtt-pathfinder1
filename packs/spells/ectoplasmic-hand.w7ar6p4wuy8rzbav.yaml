  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You draw forth a ghostly, animated hand through the ectoplasmic veil to
    manipulate objects, attack creatures, and deliver touch spells at a
    distance. The hand remains tethered to you by tendrils of ectoplasm. The
    <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> and its tether have hardness 10 and hit points equal
    to 10 + your caster level. The tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere
    along its length, ending the spell. The <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> has improved
    evasion, uses your save bonuses, and has an AC of 24 (+6 natural armor, +8
    size). The <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> moves up to 30 feet per round, and on
    each of your turns you can spend a move action to move it an additional 30
    feet. If you spend a swift action, the <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> can make an
    attack using your base attack bonus, modifying its attack rolls and damage
    rolls with your spellcasting ability score (the ability score that
    determines your spell save DCs). It deals 1d6 points of damage with a slam
    attack, and it can wield any light or one-handed weapon. The <i>ectoplasmic
    hand</i> threatens and can flank targets.  The <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> can
    also perform additional functions. <b>Deliver Touch Spell</b>: The
    <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> can deliver any spell of 6th level or lower that has
    a range of touch that you cast. You gain a +2 bonus on your melee touch
    attack roll when doing so. <b>Manipulate Object</b>: The <i>ectoplasmic
    hand</i> can manipulate unattended objects weighing no more than 5 pounds
    per caster level, moving them up to 20 feet per round in any direction you
    desire, to the limits of this spell's range. It can pull levers, open
    unstuck doors, or knock over objects. If the <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> must
    attempt a Strength check, it uses your spellcasting ability score as its
    Strength score. Using the <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> in this way requires you
    to concentrate and spend any actions you would normally need to use to
    manipulate the object yourself. <b>Combat Maneuver</b>: You can spend a
    standard action to command the <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> to perform a bull
    rush, disarm, dragAPG, stealAPG, or trip combat maneuver against a target
    creature, using your caster level as its CMB and your spellcasting ability
    score as its Strength score. The <i>ectoplasmic hand</i> takes no penalties
    for its size. This action doesn't</p>
