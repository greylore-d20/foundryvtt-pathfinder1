  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a phantom instrument, a glowing construct of magic in the
      form of a portable musical instrument of your choice. The instrument
      floats beside you, moving as you move (even if you teleport). It cannot be
      damaged, but can be dispelled. The instrument plays as you direct, and as
      long as it plays, you do not have to expend rounds of bardic performance
      from your daily allotment to maintain an effect.</p><p>Activating a bardic
      performance or switching to a new still costs a round of your overall
      bardic performances per day.</p>
