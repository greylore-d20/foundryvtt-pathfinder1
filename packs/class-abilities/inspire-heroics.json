      "value": "<p>A bard of 15th level or higher can inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. Inspired creatures gain a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;on saving throws and a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and visual components.</p>"
