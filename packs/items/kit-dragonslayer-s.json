It includes a potion of cure moderate wounds, oil of bless weapon (1 application), a longspear, a <em>backpack</em>, three large sacks, a sunrod, a tower shield, and 5 vials of alchemist's fire. For hunting dragons that are immune to fire, the alchemist's fire can be replaced with acid at the time of purchase, for a savings of 50 gp.</p>"
