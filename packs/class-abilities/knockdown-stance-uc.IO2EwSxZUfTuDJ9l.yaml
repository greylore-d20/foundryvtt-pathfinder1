  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian can focus on toppling her foes. Once per round, she can
      make a trip attack against one target in place of a melee attack. If she
      succeeds, the target is knocked prone. This trip attempt doesn’t provoke
      an attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>

      <p>Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A barbarian can’t have
      more than one stance rage power active at a time. If she activates a
      stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance
      immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning
      of the barbarian’s turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the
      rage ends.</p>
