      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.ijwcwnt3oatnfghq]{prismatic wall}, except
      you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light
      that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere
      flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum.</p><p>The sphere's
      <em>blindness</em> effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4 x 10
      minutes.</p><p>You can pass into and out of the <em>prismatic sphere</em>
      and remain near it without harm. When you're inside it, however, the
      sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere
      (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass
      through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.</p><p>Typically,
      only the upper hemisphere of the globe exists, since you are at the center
      of the sphere, so the lower half is usually occluded by the floor surface
      you are standing on.</p><p>The colors of the sphere have the same effects
      as the colors of a <em>prismatic wall</em>.</p><p><em>Prismatic
      sphere</em> can be made permanent with a <em>permanency</em> spell.</p>
