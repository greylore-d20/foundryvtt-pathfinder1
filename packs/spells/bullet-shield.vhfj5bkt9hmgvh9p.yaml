      <p>The warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC against firearm
      and ranged attacks, with an additional +1 to the bonus for every five
      caster levels you have (to a maximum of +8 at 20th level). Though the
      spell is called bullet shield, it also grants this protection from attacks
      made from firearms with the scatter weapon quality.</p>
