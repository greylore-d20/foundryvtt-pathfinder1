  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can call upon the randomness of the Maelstrom to move in
      unpredictable ways. She can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a
      swift action to gain the benefits of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ja005kj1gh7g0dnk]{Entropic Shield} for 1 minute and
      move 10 feet in a random direction. For the next minute, she moves 10 feet
      in a random direction at the end of each of her turns. This movement does
      not provoke attacks of opportunity or count against her movement for the
      round. If the movement would end her movement in an occupied space, she
      instead travels to the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
