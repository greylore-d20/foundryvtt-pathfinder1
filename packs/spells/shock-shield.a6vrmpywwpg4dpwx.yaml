  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates an invisible <i>shield</i> similar to but not as
      strong as the <i>shield</i> spell. This <i>shield</i> hovers in front of
      you and negates <i>magic missile</i> attacks directed at you. The disk
      provides a +2 <i>shield</i> bonus to AC. This bonus applies against
      incorporeal touch attacks.  At any time, as a free action, you may dismiss
      your <i>shield</i>, at which point it deals 1d6 points of electrical
      damage to all creatures within a 5-foot burst, including you. A Reflex
      saving throw halves the damage.</p>
