  shortDescription: >-
    <p>When you cast this spell, you instantly know the direction of north from
    your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which
    "north" exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge
    of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again
    within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you
    keep track of direction.</p>
