  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius and
      increasing the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet beyond
      that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light).
      A torch does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light.
      If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon
      that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size,
      plus 1 point of fire damage.</p>
