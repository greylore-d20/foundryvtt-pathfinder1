      <p>You call forth a fast-moving wave that batters all creatures in its
      path and leaves the target area flooded. Each creature in the area must
      succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 2
      caster levels (maximum 10d6). The wave also attempts a bull rush combat
      maneuver against all creatures of any size within its area of effect.
      Attempt a single combat maneuver check and apply the result to each
      creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your
      caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier,
      whichever is highest. This bull rush attempt doesnâ€™t provoke attacks of
      opportunity.</p><p>The area covered by the cone remains inundated for 1
      round per caster level. If cast on land, treat the area as a <em>deep
      bog</em>. If cast on water, the water level within the affected area rises
      by 5 feet.</p>
