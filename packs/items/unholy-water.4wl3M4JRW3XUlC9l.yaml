      <p>Category Alchemical Weapons</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Unholy water
      damages good outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of unholy water
      can be thrown as a splash weapon.</p><p>Treat this attack as a ranged
      touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown
      against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an
      incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out
      onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy
      water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack
      that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>A direct hit by a
      flask of unholy water deals 2d4 points of damage to a good outsider. Each
      such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1
      point of damage from the splash.</p><p><span style="font-family:Signika,
