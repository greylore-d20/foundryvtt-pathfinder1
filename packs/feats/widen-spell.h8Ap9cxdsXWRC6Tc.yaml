    value: >-
      <i>You can cast your spells so that they occupy a larger
      space.</i><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You can alter a burst, emanation,
      or spread-shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of
      the spell's area increase by 100%. A widened spell uses up a spell slot
      three levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p><p>Spells that do
      not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this
      feat.</p>
