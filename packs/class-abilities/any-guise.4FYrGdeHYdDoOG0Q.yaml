  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A vigilante can use his everyman social talent to disguise himself as
      any specific person, even a king or high priest. Furthermore, if the
      actual individual wouldnâ€™t normally be able to be found via magic (such as
      by being dead or protected from divinations designed to locate the
      individual), such divinations always find the vigilante instead.</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 17th level and have the everyman social
      talent to select this talent.</p>
