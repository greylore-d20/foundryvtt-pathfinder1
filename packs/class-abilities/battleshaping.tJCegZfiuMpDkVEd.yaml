  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you grow a single natural weapon. The natural weapon
      lasts for 1 round and has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage
      rolls for every four wizard levels you possess. You can grow a claw, a
      bite, or a gore attack. These attacks deal the normal damage for a
      creature of your size. At 11th level, you can shape two natural weapons.
      You may not grow additional limbs or a tail with this ability. You can use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence
      modifier.</p>
