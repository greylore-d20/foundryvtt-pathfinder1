            <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot
            radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional
            20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light
            becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in
            normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it
            as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
            equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire
            damage.</p>

            <p>Magic containers come in almost as many varieties as there are
            <em>alchemists</em>, and so are of inestimable value to
            <em>alchemists</em> with specific needs. Some of the most well-known
            magic containers are described here.</p>

            <p>Because of a varied nature of alchemical items and their effects,
            not all combinations of alchemical items and magic bottles are
            viable or even make sense, even though they technically might be
            allowed by the rules. The GM should have the final say on whether or
            not a particular alchemical item can function within one of the
            magical containers listed in this section.</p>

            <h4>Candle</h4>

            <p>A candle dimly illuminates a small area, increasing the light
            level in a 5-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light and
            dim light becomes normal light). A candle cannot increase the light
            level above normal light. A candle burns for 1 hour. <b>Price</b> 1
            cp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>

            <p><b>Candle, Helmet</b> This device consists of a helmet with a
            short, thin spike on top upon which a <em>candle</em> is stuck,
            freeing your hands for other tasks. <b>Price</b> 2 gp; <b>Weight</b>
            4 lbs.</p>

            <p><b>Candle Lamp</b> A candle lamp is a small lantern-like device
            with glass panels and a slot to hold a <em>candle</em>. It protects
            the <em>candle</em> from drafts and catches wax drippings. It
            provides the same light as a <em>candle</em>, but can be shuttered
            such that it only illuminates 1 to 3 adjacent squares. You can use a
            <em>candle lamp</em> to keep your hands warm. <b>Price</b> 5 gp;
            <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>

            <p><b>Candlestick</b> This saucer-like object has a flat bottom, a
            handle, and a spike on top. You can affix a <em>candle</em> onto the
            spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the candlestick by the
            handle. The flat bottom means you're able to set it down and not
            worry about the <em>candle</em> falling over and extinguishing
            itself. A typical candlestick is crafted from baked <em>clay</em> or
            a cheap metal such as copper, but elaborate and expensive ones
            exist. <b>Price</b> 1 cp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>
