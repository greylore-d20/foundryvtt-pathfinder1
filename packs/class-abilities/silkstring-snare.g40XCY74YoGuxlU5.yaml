    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes ribbons of spider silk to erupt from the ground
      beneath a single creature. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or be
      entangled and anchored in place. The foe can escape the silk as a standard
      action with a successful Escape Artist or Strength check at the same DC,
      or by dealing an amount of damage to the silk equal to double the shaman’s
      class level (the silk has hardness 0).</p>

      <p>This hex lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shaman’s Wisdom
      modifier.</p>

      <p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24
      hours.</p>
