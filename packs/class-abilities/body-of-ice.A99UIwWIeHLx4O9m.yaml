  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can transmute your body and equipment to ice for a
      period of time. It takes a standard action to take on the form of ice, and
      you can end the transmutation with a free action on your turn. When you
      take on the form of ice, you are immune to cold and have DR 5/â€”, but you
      take twice the normal amount of damage from fire. You can take on the form
      of ice for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. The
      rounds need not be consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Cold Resistance power of the Water Domain.</p>
