      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to take on the appearance of another creature that you touch. If the creature is not friendly to you, this requires a melee touch attack, but the target doesn’t receive a saving throw to negate the effect. You gain a circumstance bonus on Disguise checks equal to your occultist level + 10, but only to look like the creature touched. This bonus doesn’t stack with the bonuses from polymorph spells or spells like&nbsp;disguise self. While using this ability, you can change your disguise as a standard action by touching a different creature and assuming its appearance. You can end this effect at any time.</p>\n<p>This effect lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess, but you can renew the duration at any time by expending 1 additional point of mental focus.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p>"
