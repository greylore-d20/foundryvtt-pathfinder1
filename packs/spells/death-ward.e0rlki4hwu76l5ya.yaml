    value: >-
      <p>The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells
      and magical death effects. The subject is granted a save to negate such
      effects even if one is not normally allowed. The subject is immune to
      energy drain and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative
      energy.</p><p>This spell does not remove negative levels that the subject
      has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from negative levels
      for the duration of its effect.</p><p><i>Death ward</i> does not protect
      against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.</p>
