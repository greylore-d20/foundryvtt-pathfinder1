  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>symbol of death</i>, except it saps the
      defenses of all creatures within 60 feet. Affected creatures receive a -4
      penalty to spell resistance and a -4 penalty on saving throws, and energy
      resistances and damage reduction (if any) are reduced by 10 each (to a
      minimum of 0). Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes
      per level.</p><p>The effects last as long as the creature is within 60
      feet of the symbol, and for 1 round per caster level
      afterward.</p><p><i>Symbol of vulnerability</i> can be made permanent with
      a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 18h level or higher for the cost
      of 25,000 gp.</p>
