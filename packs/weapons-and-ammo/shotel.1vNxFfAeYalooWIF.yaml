      downward-curving sword designed to reach over or around an opponent's
      shield. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a shotel against
      opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields. The curve of a
      shotel's blade varies from sword to sword, and some models are
      double-edged, while others are single-edged, with the back edge able to be
      braced against a shield for additional power. Shotels are particularly
      useful for hooking mounted combatants and ripping them from their
      steeds.</p>
