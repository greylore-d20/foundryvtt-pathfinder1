        is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending
        the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep,
        whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you are
        disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a concentration check
        as if you were in the midst of casting a spell or the spell
        ends.</p><p>If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your
        surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.</p><p>You
        are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You
        always fail Reflex and Will saving throws, for example.) Creatures who
        don't sleep (such as outsiders) or dream are immune to this spell.</p>

      <p>You send your spirit to torment another being’s dreams. Once per day,
      you may target a creature with the effects of a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.siv3ub7hbmcklf8c]{Nightmare} spell. Instead of the
      spell’s normal damage, you make a full attack, using your Charisma
      modifier in place of your Strength modifier, against the victim’s touch
      AC. You deal 1d10 damage for each successful hit.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level before selecting this revelation.</p>
