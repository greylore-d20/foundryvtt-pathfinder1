  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell allows you to safeguard important knowledge, even from
      yourself. When casting this spell, you recount one piece of knowledge you
      possess (up to a maximum of 50 words). This knowledge disappears utterly
      from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic
      of the spell patches omissions in your memory with indistinct haze
      <i>Repress memory</i> protects against <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>discern
      lies</i>, <i>zone of truth</i>, and similar spells, though careful
      questioning may reveal the gaps in your memory, or that your memory has
      been affected by the spell.  A repressed memory can be restored only by
      <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>psychic surgery</i>, <i>limited
      <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. If you use this spell to
      negate the memory of a magical compulsion, it doesn't remove the
      compulsion, nor does it remove procedural memories that might affect your
      skills or class abilities.  At the GM's discretion, multiple castings of
      this spell might erase memories of a lengthier event or all memory of a
      place or individual from your memory.</p>
