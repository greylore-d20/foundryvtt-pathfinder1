  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, the cavalier can call upon the spirits of the fallen for
      protection. Once per day as an immediate action when attacked by an undead
      target of his challenge, the cavalier can gain a deflection bonus equal to
      his Charisma modifier to his AC against that attack. The cavalier must
      decide to use this ability before the attack roll.</p>
