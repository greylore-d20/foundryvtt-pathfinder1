    value: >-
      <p>You create a spherical magnetic field that surrounds you to a range of
      30 feet and follows you for the duration of the spell.</p><p>Unattended
      metal objects in range-including weapons, armor, and anything made
      primarily out of metal-are pulled violently toward you, stopping just
      short of your space and falling harmlessly to the ground. Objects secured
      to a nonmetallic fixture remain where they are unless a forceful tug would
      be enough to detach them. Loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are
      not affected. If the magnetic field would cause a dangerous metal object
      such as a sword or anvil to intersect a square occupied by a creature,
      that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage as if from an
      improvised weapon of the object's size (or smaller or larger, at the GM's
      discretion).</p><p>A creature in the area wearing metal armor, wielding a
      metal weapon, or holding a metal object must succeed at a Reflex save or
      be dragged 5 feet closer to you in a straight line, as if affected by the
      pull universal monster rule (<i>Bestiary</i> 303). A creature can drop a
      metal object it's holding as a free action to avoid the effect if it's not
      wearing metal armor; a creature being dragged by its shield can loosen it
      as a move action and drop it as a free action. Creatures made entirely or
      mostly of metal take a -2 penalty on their Reflex saves. Creatures that
      fail their saves by 5 or more are pulled an additional 5 feet closer for
      every increment of 5 by which they failed their saves.</p>
