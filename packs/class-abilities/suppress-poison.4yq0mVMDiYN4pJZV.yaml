  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can stave off the effects of a poison. As
      an immediate action when she fails a saving throw against a poison, the
      rogue can attempt the saving throw a second time. If she succeeds at this
      second saving throw, the poison does not affect her for a number of rounds
      equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round), but this time it
      counts against the poisonâ€™s duration. This talent has no effect on poisons
      with an onset longer than immediate.</p>
