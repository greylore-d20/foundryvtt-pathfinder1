  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>A tailblade is a small, sharp knife designed to be strapped to the
      tip of a wielder’s tail.</em></p>

      <p>A ratfolk wielding a tailblade can make a tail attack, adding its
      <em>Strength</em> modifier to the tailblade’s damage.</p>

      <p>Ratfolk are considered proficient with such attacks and can apply feats
      or effects appropriate to <em>natural attacks</em> to tail attacks made
      with a tailblade. If used as part of a full attack action, attacks with a
      tailblade are considered secondary attacks.</p>

      <p>It takes a <em>full-round action</em> to strap on or remove a
      tailblade. The wearer can loosely attach the tailblade (without strapping
      it securely in place) as a <em>move action</em>, but using a loosely
      attached tailblade gives the wielder a –4 penalty on all <em>attack
      rolls</em> made with the weapon, and other creatures get a +4 bonus on
      <em>disarm combat maneuver</em> checks to <em>disarm</em> the
      tailblade.</p>
