  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Shield</i> creates an invisible <i>shield</i> of force that hovers
      in front of you. It negates <i>magic missile</i> attacks directed at you.
      The disk also provides a +4 <i>shield</i> bonus to AC. This bonus applies
      against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The
      <i>shield</i> has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure
      chance.</p>
