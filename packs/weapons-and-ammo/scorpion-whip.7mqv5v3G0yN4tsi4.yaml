  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This whip has a series of razor-sharp blades and fangs inset along its
      tip. It deals lethal damage, even to creatures with armor bonuses. If you
      are proficient with both the scorpion whip and whip, you can use a
      scorpion whip in either the normal way (as a light performance weapon) or
      as a whip. When you use a scorpion whip as a whip, it is equivalent to a
      whip, but deals lethal damage and can harm creatures regardless of their
      armor bonus.</p>
