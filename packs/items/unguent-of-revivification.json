      "value": "\r\n<p>The preservation of dead flesh is important in undead-friendly cultures. In such places this alchemical ointment is commonly used as a cheaper alternative to <a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gentle-repose\">gentle repose</a> to give their <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a> flesh the blush of life. A single dose staves off the decomposition of dead flesh for 1d6 days. It cannot reverse decay that is already present and has no effect on the time limit for raising creatures from the dead.</p>\r\n"
