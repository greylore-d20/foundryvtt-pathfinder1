    value: >-
      <p>This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead creature. If
      the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions favorably
      (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell
      lasts. You can give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed
      Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do.
      Retries are not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys
      suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that
      something very dangerous is worth doing.</p><p>A nonintelligent undead
      creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a
      mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "come
      here," "go there," "fight," "stand still," and so on. Nonintelligent
      undead won't resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.</p><p>Any act by
      you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead
      (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell.</p><p>Your commands are
      not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.</p>
