    value: >-
      <p>You rapidly catalog and collate all available data on a person, place,
      thing, or event, calling to mind scraps of memory and assembling clues in
      a logical and systematic order. Immediately after casting the spell, you
      can begin spending the necessary time to perform an Intelligence check, a
      Linguistics check to detect a forgery or decipher a hidden message, or a
      Knowledge check. If the check requires at least 3 rounds, you can perform
      it five times as quickly (minimum 1 round). If the check required fewer
      than 3 rounds, you can perform it instantly. Either way, you gain an
      insight bonus on the check equal to your caster level (maximum bonus +10),
      but this bonus can't raise your result above what you could have achieved
      on a natural 20.</p>
