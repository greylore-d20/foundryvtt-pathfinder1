      pairs, these solid metal blades end in curved hooks, while the hand guards
      are hammered into outward-facing spiked crescents. Both the crescent and
      the tip of the hilt are sharpened for combat. They can be wielded as
      single weapons or with two-weapon fighting styles. These weapons gain the
      disarm special feature when they are used individually. A pair of shang
      gou can also be formed into a single one-handed weapon to gain the trip
      special feature.</p>
