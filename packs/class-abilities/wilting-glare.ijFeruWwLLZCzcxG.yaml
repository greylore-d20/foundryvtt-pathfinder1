  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can leach moisture and vitality from a
      living, corporeal creature you can see within 30 feet. The target takes an
      amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1d6 + 1 for every 2 cleric levels you
      have and becomes fatigued until the beginning of your next turn (Fortitude
      negates). Plant creatures and those with the aquatic or water subtype take
      lethal damage from this ability, and they are fatigued for a number of
      rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. You can use this ability a number of
      times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Sun's Blessing power of the Sun Domain.</p>
