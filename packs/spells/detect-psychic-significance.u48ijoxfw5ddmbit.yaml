  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You detect the presence of psychically significant items in your
      vicinity. Such items are those that might have significant psychic
      imprints or histories that can be read by the psychometry occult skill
      unlock (see page 196), or items under the effects of the <i>charge
      object</i> or <i>implant false reading</i> spells. Items within range that
      contain significant psychic energy spark a recognition in your mind's eye,
      but no other information is imparted. This spell doesn't automatically
      detect magic items or strongly aligned items, though such items often have
      storied histories and might have had previous owners who possessed psychic
      abilities.</p>
