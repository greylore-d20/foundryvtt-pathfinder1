      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This wickedly curved sickle is cast in the
      form of a segmented spider's leg. It has the same statistics as a normal
      sickle and can trip opponents, but deals piercing damage rather than
      slashing damage. The leatherwrapped handle contains a hollow recess that
      can hold a single dose of poison. Filling the reservoir is a full-round
      action that carries the usual risks of poisoning yourself. Once filled,
      the reservoir keeps the blade saturated and viable for up to 2 hours. The
      first successful attack made with the spider-leg sickle during this time
      administers and expends the dose of poison. Mog-Lathar's deacons carry
      masterwork versions of these weapons. The cult uses blue whinnis poison,
      and within the radius of the <em>dreamstone</em>'s effects the
      unconsciousness effect may trigger lucid dreaming.</p>
