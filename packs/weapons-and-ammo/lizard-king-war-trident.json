These large, two-handed tridents are much heavier than normal (12 pounds) in order to take advantage of their wielders' great strength, and as a result they lose their range increment but deal 1d10 points of damage and have a x3 critical hit multiplier. In addition, extensive ritualistic practice with this weapon gives the lizard king the Improved Critical (war trident) feat as a bonus feat. A war trident is worth 20 gp, although most are masterwork and many are inlaid with precious metals and fetch higher prices.</p>"
