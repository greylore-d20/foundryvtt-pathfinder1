  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These spikes turn a shield into a martial piercing weapon and increase
      the damage dealt by a <em>shield bash</em> as if the shield were designed
      for a creature one size category larger than you. You canâ€™t put spikes on
      a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is
      like making a shield bash attack.</p><p>An enhancement bonus on a spiked
      shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it,
      but a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
