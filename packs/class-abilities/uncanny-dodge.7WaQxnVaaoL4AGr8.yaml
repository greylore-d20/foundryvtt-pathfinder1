  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This character gains the ability to react to danger before her senses
      would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught
      <em>flat-footed</em>, nor does she lose her <em>Dex</em> bonus to AC if
      the attacker is invisible. She still loses her <em>Dexterity</em> bonus to
      <em>armor class</em> if immobilized. A character with this ability can
      still lose her <em>Dexterity</em> bonus to <em>armor class</em> if an
      opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>

      <p>If a character already has <em>uncanny dodge</em> from a different
      class, she automatically gains <em>improved uncanny dodge</em> (see below)
      instead.</p>
