    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, you raise water as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.7yf67b7y4byj96w7]{Control Water}, but no water need
      be present. This created water is stationary and does not flow out of the
      area where you create it; it lasts 1 round per sorcerer level and then
      disappears. At 20th level, the dimensions of the effect are doubled. You
      may use this ability once per day.</p>
