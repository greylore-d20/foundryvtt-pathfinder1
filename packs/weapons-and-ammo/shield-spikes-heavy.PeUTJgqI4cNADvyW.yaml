    value: "<p>These spikes turn a shield into a martial piercing weapon and increase the damage dealt by a\_<em>shield bash</em>\_as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you. You canâ€™t put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack.</p><p>An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>"
