  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to add a
      metamagic feat that she knows to a spell as she casts it without affecting
      the casting time (though using a higher-level spell slot as normal). She
      can use this ability to add a metamagic feat to a spell that she prepared
      using a metamagic feat, although she cannot add the same metamagic feat to
      a given spell more than once.</p>
