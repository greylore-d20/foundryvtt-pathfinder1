      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.8u1xa5javcxc6szk]{rage}, except it
      affects only undead creatures and bolsters them with necromantic energy
      rather than emotion. Each affected creature gains a +2 profane bonus to
      Strength and Charisma, a +1 profane bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty
      to AC. The effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's
      <em>rage</em>.</p>
