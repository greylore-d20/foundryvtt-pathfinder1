    value: >-
      <p>This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from
      magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue
      with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails
      her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC.
      She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.</p>
