      "value": "<p><b>Price</b> 10 gp; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>\n<p>This one-piece suit of clothing reduces one's drag in the water, making swimming easier. It provides a +1 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Swim</em> checks. The suit only grants this bonus if it is the outermost garment, and has no effect if worn over bulky clothes or armor or with cumbersome gear (such as a backpack, large weapons, and so on). Damage to the suit (such as from several rounds of combat against slashing and piercing attacks) negates the suit's bonus until it is repaired.</p>"
