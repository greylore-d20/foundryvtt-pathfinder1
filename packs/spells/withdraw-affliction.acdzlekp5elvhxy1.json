The target creature is cured as if affected by <i>remove disease</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>neutralize poison</i>.  In addition, this slimy mass allows you to deliver the affliction to another as a touch attack, as if holding the charge for a touch spell. It has the same effect as the original affliction, with the same saving throw and DC.</p>"
