      <p>The kestros is an oddly shaped Bronze Age sling used for launching
      kestros darts. Your Strength modifier applies on damage rolls when you use
      a kestros, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire-but not load-a
      kestros with one hand. Loading a kestros is a move action that requires
      two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. Halflings treat the kestros
      as a martial weapon.</p>
