  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You hurl a tiny ball of negative energy, destroying plant life either
      in a line 60 feet long or a 10-foot-radius spread. This effect removes the
      cover and concealment provided by trees and undergrowth, eliminates the
      movement penalties associated with undergrowth, and so forth.</p><p>You
      may also target a single plant creature with this spell. You must succeed
      on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. An affected plant creature
      takes 2d8 points of damage.</p>
