      <p>You fill your target with boredom. The target loses all interest in its
      current task and must make a Will save against the spell's effect in order
      to perform its next action. If the target fails, it takes no action that
      round. The boredom lasts until the duration expires or the target breaks
      the spell's effect with a successful Will save.</p>
