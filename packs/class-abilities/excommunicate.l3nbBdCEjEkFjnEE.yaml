  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, once per day, you can silence a creature within 30 feet
      as a standard action. A Will save against DC = 10 + 1/2 your inquisitor
      level + your Wisdom modifier negates the effect. A creature that fails its
      save gets a second save 1 round later. If it fails the second save, the
      target cannot speak, provide verbal components for spells, make use of
      language-dependent effects, write, pantomime, or take any other action
      meant to communicate anything more complex than a simple affirmative or
      negative for 1 day.</p>
