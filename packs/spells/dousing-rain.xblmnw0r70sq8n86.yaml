  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With a beckoning gesture, you call forth a downpour of rain. For the
      duration of the spell, the following effects apply within the affected
      area. Nonmagical fires are automatically extinguished, and all creatures
      and objects in the area gain fire resistance 5. The conjured water is
      conductive, and whenever a doused creature takes electricity damage, it
      takes 1 additional point of electricity damage. At 6th, 12th, and 18th
      levels, the fire resistance increases by 5 and the additional electricity
      damage increases by 1 point.</p>
