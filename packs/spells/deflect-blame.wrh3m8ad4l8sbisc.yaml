      <p>You can cast this spell immediately after attacking a creature, causing
      that creature to believe that a different creature that threatens it was
      responsible for the attack rather than you. You can instead cast this
      spell immediately after a failed Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check,
      causing the target of that check to believe that a different creature you
      designate within spell range was responsible for the content of that
      failed check. Using the spell in these ways doesn't compel the target to
      undertake a specific action in response to its belief of where the blame
      lies.</p>
