      "value": "<p>As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege engine with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist’s next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist’s bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb’s damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the explosive bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>"
