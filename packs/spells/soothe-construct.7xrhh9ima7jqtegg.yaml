  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You soothe the elemental spirit of a targeted construct, reducing its
      chance of going berserk by 1d4% per four caster levels (maximum 5d4%). If
      cast on a construct that has already gone berserk and you are its master,
      you may immediately roll d% to end the construct's berserk state, it
      returns to normal functioning, and its berserk chance returns to 0%.</p>
