      <p>This flask is filled with the detritus of minor ectoplasmic phantoms
      and similar creatures. You can throw a flask of ectoplasmic residue as a
      splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range
      increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals no damage, but the target must
      succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Every creature
      within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits must succeed at a DC 13
      Will save or be shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear
      effect.</p>
