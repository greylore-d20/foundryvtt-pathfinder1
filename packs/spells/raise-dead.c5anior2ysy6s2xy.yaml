    value: >-
      <p>You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that
      has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level. In addition, the
      subject's soul must be free and willing to return.</p><p>If the subject's
      soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a
      subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.</p><p>Coming back
      from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell gains two permanent
      negative levels when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an
      energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points
      of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less,
      it can't be raised). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50%
      chance of losing any given spell upon being raised. A spellcasting
      creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance
      of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a
      spell.</p><p>A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its
      current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison
      and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but
      magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal
      wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature
      to be raised must be whole.</p><p>Otherwise, missing parts are still
      missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead
      creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this
      spell.</p><p>A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or
      killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs,
      elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell
      cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.</p>
