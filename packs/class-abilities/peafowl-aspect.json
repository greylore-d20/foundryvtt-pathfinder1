      "value": "<p><em>Peafowl are popular ornamental birds due to their spectacular colors, and they are often symbols of royalty or the divine. A shifter using the alternate natural attacks rules on page 8 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Wilderness Origins can select a bite (B, P, S) or tail slap (B) attack.</em><p><b>Minor Form:</b> You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Charisma score.</p>\n<p>At 8th level the bonus increases to +4, and at 15th level it increases to +6.<p><b>Major Form:</b> Your shape changes to that of a Small <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Peafowl\">peafowl</a>. While in this form you gain low-light vision, a fly speed of 40 feet (clumsy), two talon attacks (1d3 damage), and a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks. A peafowl canâ€™t use its fly speed to hover and must end any flying move action by landing or perching on a solid surface. A peafowl can perform a captivating dance targeting all creatures within a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone that can see your dance must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your shifter level + your Charisma modifier) or be stunned for 1 round.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the stunned effect lasts for 2 rounds, and at 15th level the duration increases to 4 rounds. Whether or not it succeeds at the initial save, a creature cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours.<p><b>Alternate Natural Attacks:</b> Bite (B, P, S), tail slap (B)</p>"
