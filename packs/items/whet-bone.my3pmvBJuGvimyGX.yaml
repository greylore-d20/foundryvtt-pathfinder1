      <p><strong>Category</strong> Animal Gear</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This
      hardened mixture of animal marrow and minerals is shaped into a long bone.
      When chewed upon by a creature for no fewer than 15 minutes, a whet bone
      grants the creature a +1 bonus on its next damage roll the first time it
      hits with a bite attack. This only works on nonmagical bite attacks.</p>
