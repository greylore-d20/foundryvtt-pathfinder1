  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Blade boots come with a spring-mounted knife that pops out when
      triggered with the right combination of toe presses. You can use a blade
      boot as an off-hand weapon. Releasing the knife is a swift action;
      rearming it is a full-round action. When the blade is extended, you treat
      normal terrain as difficult and difficult terrain as impassable.</p>
