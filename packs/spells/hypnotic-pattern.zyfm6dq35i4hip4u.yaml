    value: >-
      <p>A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air,
      fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level
      (maximum 10) to determine the total number of HD of creatures affected.
      Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with
      equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are
      affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are
      wasted. Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern of colors.
      Sightless creatures are not affected.</p><p>A wizard or sorcerer need not
      utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must perform as a verbal
      component.</p>
