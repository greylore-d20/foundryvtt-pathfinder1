      <p>This spell alters details of your appearance so that you are no longer
      recognizable as yourself. Your new appearance is within the norms for your
      race, ethnicity, and gender. You lack control over the details of your
      appearance; however, when casting <i>false face</i>, you can choose an
      appearance you previously used, allowing you to maintain specific
      identities.</p>
