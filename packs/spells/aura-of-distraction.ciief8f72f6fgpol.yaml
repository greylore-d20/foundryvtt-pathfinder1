      <p>You emit an aura of subsonic noise and mental imagery that makes
      concentrating difficult. Any creature within the aura that fails its save
      takes a -5 penalty on concentration checks. A creature must attempt the
      Will save upon entering the area of the aura, and the penalty ends as soon
      as the creature leaves the aura. A creature that succeeds at its save is
      immune to the effects of the aura for this casting of the spell, even if
      it leaves and reenters the aura, but must attempt another Will save each
      additional time this spell is cast. You are immune to your own <i>Aura of
      Distraction</i>.</p>
