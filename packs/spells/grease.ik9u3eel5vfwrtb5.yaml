      <p>A <i>grease</i> spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery
      <i>grease</i>. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a
      successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the
      area of <i>grease</i> at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check.
      Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save
      or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics
      skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need
      to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.</p><p>The spell can
      also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.</p><p>Material objects
      not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or
      employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw
      to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature
      immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that
      the creature attempts to pick up or use the <i>grease</i>d item. A
      creature wearing <i>grease</i>d armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance
      bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a
      grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.</p>
