      <p>You reach into the target creature and cause that spirits within to
      become dormant and inactive. If the target is a medium with a spirit
      inhabiting its body or a spiritualist with a phantom inhabiting its
      consciousness (or a member of another class using the spirit or phantom
      class features), a failed save renders that spirit or phantom powerless,
      suppressing any benefits the spirit or phantom normally provides to its
      host, including bonus feats and spells known.  If a spirit within the
      target is a creature using a <i>possession</i> effect, including
      <i>possess object</i>, <i>possession</i>, or a ghost's malevolence, the
      spell targets the possessing creature rather than the creature it
      inhabits. On a failed save, the possessing spirit isn't exorcised from the
      target but is dazed for the duration of the spell.</p>
