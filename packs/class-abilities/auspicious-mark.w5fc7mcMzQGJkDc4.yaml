  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian has been marked by the spirits, as indicated by an
      impressive tattoo, scar, or birthmark she possesses. Once per rage, as a
      swift action that costs 2 rounds of rage, the barbarian can call upon the
      spiritsâ€™ favor. Using auspicious mark grants her a +1d6 bonus on one d20
      roll she has just made. She can call on the auspicious mark after seeing
      the result of the d20 roll.</p>
