  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the magus enhances his weapon using his arcane pool, he may
      spend 1 additional point from his arcane pool to add either the anarchic,
      axiomatic, holy, or unholy special ability to the list of available
      options. A magus may only add one of these abilities if it matches his own
      alignment.</p>

      <p>The magus must be at least 12th level before selecting this arcana.</p>
