  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You energize your body's immune system, improving your ability to resist
    toxins and ailments. You gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws to
    resist diseases, drugs, and poisons. Additionally, at any time during the
    spell's duration, whenever you fail a saving throw to resist a disease,
    drug, or poison, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as an
    immediate action in order to reroll that saving throw. You must take the
    second result, even if it's worse. The +2 resistance bonus granted by the
    spell applies to the reroll, but after you make this reroll, the spell
    ends.</p>
