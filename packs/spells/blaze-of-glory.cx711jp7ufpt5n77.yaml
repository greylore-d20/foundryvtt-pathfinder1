  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You fall unconscious but also unleash a spectacular wave of holy energy
    that heartens and heals your allies while leaving your opponents daunted and
    damaged. You can cast this spell as either a standard action on your turn,
    or as an immediate action when brought to below 0 hit points. If cast as a
    standard action, you are immediately reduced to -1 hit points, but stable,
    after casting the spell.</p><p>When you cast this spell, any good creature
    within range is healed for 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels. All
    evil creatures within range take the same amount as damage instead (a
    successful Will save halves this damage). In addition, all allies and
    enemies within range are affected as if by the <i>prayer</i> spell for 1
    round per caster level.</p>
