    value: >-
      <p>You cause flames to spring up in the area of effect. These flames deal
      1d6 points of fire damage for every 3 caster levels you have (maximum 5d6)
      to each creature that enters a burning area or begins its turn in the
      area; these creatures also catch on fire. A creature that succeeds at a
      Reflex save negates the damage and avoids catching on fire. The area and
      all adjacent 5-foot squares are smoky, providing concealment within. You
      can concentrate as a standard action to ignite one 5-foot square adjacent
      to a currently burning square. Heavy precipitation (including <i>sleet</i>
      storm) ends the spell. Strong and severe winds spread each square of
      <i>flashfire</i> downwind by one square each round, but windstorm-force or
      stronger winds extinguish the fires.</p>
