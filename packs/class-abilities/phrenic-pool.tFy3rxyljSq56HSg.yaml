  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A psychic has a pool of supernatural mental energy that she can draw
      upon to manipulate psychic spells as she casts them. The maximum number of
      points in a psychic’s phrenic pool is equal to 1/2 her psychic level + her
      Wisdom or Charisma modifier, as determined by her psychic discipline.</p>

      <p>The phrenic pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or
      meditation; these hours don’t need to be consecutive. The psychic might be
      able to recharge points in her phrenic pool in additional circumstances
      dictated by her psychic discipline.</p>

      <p>Points gained in excess of the pool’s maximum are lost.</p>
