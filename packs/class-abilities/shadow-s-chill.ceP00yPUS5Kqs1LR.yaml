    value: >-
      <p>When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee weapon that
      deals sneak attack damage, a number of points of the damage dealt equal to
      the number of sneak attack dice rolled is cold damage. The remainder of
      the sneak attack damage and the normal weapon damage are unaffected. The
      rogue must have cold resistance from a racial trait before selecting this
      talent.</p>
