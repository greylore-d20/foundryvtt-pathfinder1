      Arcana:</strong> Whenever you cast a spell of the <em>compulsion</em>
      subschool, increase the spellâ€™s DC by +2.</p><p><strong>Bloodline
      Powers:</strong> You have always had a tie to the natural world, and as
      your power increases, so does the influence of the fey over your
      magic.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.rmvMcgMGQT2fzoQf]{Laughing
      Touch (Sp)}: At 1st level, you can cause a creature to burst out laughing
      for 1 round as a melee touch attack. A laughing creature can only take a
      move action but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been
      affected by laughing touch, it is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You
      can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma
      modifier.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.5iXq1igb1Cq0qobT]{Woodland
      Stride (Ex)}: At 3rd level, you can move through any sort of undergrowth
      (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at
      your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other
      impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically
      manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect
      you.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.XwAryoOw0A6WKTs5]{Fleeting
      Glance (Sp)}: At 9th level, you can turn invisible for a number of rounds
      per day equal to your sorcerer level. This ability functions as greater
      invisibility. These rounds need not be
      consecutive.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.QPraKiK8WmomsX4Z]{Fey
      Magic (Su)}: At 15th level, you may reroll any caster level check made to
      overcome spell resistance. You must decide to use this ability before the
      results are revealed by the GM. You must take the second result, even if
      it is worse. You can use this ability at
      will.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.NI7RFZwJVmjvRwDF]{Soul
      of the Fey (Su)}: At 20th level, your soul becomes one with the world of
      the fey. You gain immunity to poison and DR 10/cold iron. Creatures of the
      animal type do not attack you unless compelled to do so through magic.
      Once per day, you can cast shadow walk as a spell-like ability using your
      sorcerer level as your caster level.</p>
