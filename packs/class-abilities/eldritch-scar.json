      "value": "<p>Once per day when you damage a creature with a spell you cast, you may, as a swift action, cause your magic to leave an eldritch scar upon that creature. An eldritch scar appears as a normal scar, save that it flickers with faint radiance of a color of your choice. The next time that creature casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item, it triggers a primal magic event (see page 13) of a CR equal to your caster level. This causes the eldritch scar to vanish. A creature can be marked by only one eldritch scar at a time (a more powerful one replaces a weaker one). An eldritch scar fades automatically after 24 hours. It can be removed before that point via any effect capable of removing a curse (the curse’s level equals your caster level), but if an attempt to remove an eldritch scar fails, that attempt triggers a primal magic event—an event triggered this way does not cause the eldritch scar to fade.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>"
