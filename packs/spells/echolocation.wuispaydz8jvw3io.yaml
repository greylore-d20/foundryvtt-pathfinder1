    value: >-
      <p>You can perceive the world by creating high-pitched noises and
      listening to their echoes. This gives you blindsight to a range of 40
      feet. The echo-producing noises are too highpitched to be heard by most
      creatures, and can only be detected by dragons, other creatures with this
      ability (such as bats), and creatures with hearing-based blindsense or
      blindsight. You cannot use this ability if you are deaf, and cannot detect
      anything in an area of <i>silence</i>.</p>
