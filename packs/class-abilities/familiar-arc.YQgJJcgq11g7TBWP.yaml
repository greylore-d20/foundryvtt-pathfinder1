  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An arcanist with this exploit can acquire a familiar as the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.pW1PNlDcdGl7KuEa]{arcane bond}
      wizard class feature, using her arcanist level as her wizard level to
      determine any of the statistics and abilities of the familiar. If the
      arcanist receives a familiar from another class, her levels of arcanist
      stack with the levels from that class when determining the familiarâ€™s
      statistics and abilities (this ability does not stack with a familiar
      gained through the bloodline development exploit; she must choose one or
      the other).</p>
