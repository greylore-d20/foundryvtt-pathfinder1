    value: >-
      <p>When a ninja with this trick successfully attacks a creature that is
      holding a magic item that has a number of charges or uses per day, she can
      attempt a Use Magic Device check (DC = 20 + the item’s CL) to cause the
      item to lose either one daily use or a number of charges equal to the
      number of the ninja’s sneak attack dice.</p>
