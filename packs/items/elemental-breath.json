When elemental breath is inhaled (as drinking a <a class=\"magic-item\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>) by an air-breathing creature, that creature does not need to breath air for 10 rounds. A vial of elemental breath must be inhaled on the round it was opened to gain this effect. If it is not, the item is wasted.</p>\r\n"
