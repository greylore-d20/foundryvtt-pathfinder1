    value: >-
      <p>This spell targets an area of earth, metal, stone, or wood, causing
      long, serrated blades to shoot out from random points within the area of
      effect. Any creature in the area when the spell is first cast must attempt
      a Reflex save to avoid taking 3d8 points of piercing damage from the
      blades and an additional 2d6 points of bleed damage. A creature that fails
      the save also has its speed reduced by half for 24 hours or until the
      injured creature benefits from a "cure" spell (which restores lost hit
      points as normal). Another creature can remove the penalty by succeeding
      on a Heal check against the spell's save DC as a standard action. The
      lashing limbs remain active in the area for the remainder of the spell's
      duration, during which time the area is treated as difficult terrain, and
      any creature that moves into or through the area takes 1d8 points of
      piercing damage. The transformed area can be located on any visible
      surface within range, including floors, walls, doors, ceilings, or other
      generally flat surfaces.</p>
