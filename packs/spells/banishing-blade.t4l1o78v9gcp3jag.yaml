    value: >-
      <p>You imbue a weapon with the power to drive foes back. The first time
      each round the weapon strikes a creature, the weapon attempts a free bull
      rush combat maneuver check against that creature. This does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. The combat maneuver for the bull rush is equal to
      1d20 + your caster level. You do not have to move to push creatures more
      than 5 feet with this bull rush. If a creature you strike has spell
      resistance, you must attempt a caster level check to overcome its spell
      resistance the first time you strike it. If you fail, that creature is
      immune to the effects of this casting of <i>banishing blade</i>.  The
      first time each extraplanar creature whose Hit Dice don't exceed your
      caster level is driven back at least 10 feet by this spell, it must
      attempt a Will save. If it fails, it is sent back to its home plane.
      Whether it succeeds or fails, that creature is staggered for 1 round and
      <i>banishing blade</i>'s duration ends.</p>
