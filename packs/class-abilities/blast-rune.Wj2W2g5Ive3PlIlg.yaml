  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent
      square. Any creature entering this square takes 1d6 points of damage + 1
      point for every two cleric levels you possess. This rune deals either
      acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, decided when you create the rune.
      The rune is invisible and lasts a number of rounds equal to your cleric
      level or until discharged. You cannot create a blast rune in a square
      occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for
      the purposes of dispelling. It can be discovered with a DC 26 Perception
      skill check and disarmed with a DC 26 Disable Device skill check. You can
      use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
