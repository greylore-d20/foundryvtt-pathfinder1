  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as per <i>detect magic</i>, except that it detects
    only charm, compulsion, and possession effects. You immediately detect the
    strength and location of each such aura on all creatures in the area. You
    can attempt to identify the properties of each aura (see Spellcraft on page
    106 the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook). In addition to noticing the
    targets of these effects, you can recognize when creatures in the area are
    using these effects on others by attempting a Sense Motive check as a
    standard action (DC = 20 + caster level). If you succeed, you can attempt a
    Spellcraft check to identify what magic it is using (even if the target is
    not in the area).</p>
