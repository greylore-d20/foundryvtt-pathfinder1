  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An eidolon can pinpoint living creatures with ease. The eidolon notices
      and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the
      blindsight evolution.</p>

      <p>The eidolon must possess the undead appearance evolution to take this
      evolution.</p>

      <p>The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this
      evolution.</p>
