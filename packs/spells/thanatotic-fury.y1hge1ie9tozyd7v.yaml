      <p>You may cast this spell only if you have the giant subtype. When
      casting this spell, you channel the fury and the abilities of thanatotic
      titans, gaining some of their abilities for a short period of time. When
      you hit a creature capable of casting divine spells, that creature must
      succeed at a Will saving throw or be unable to cast divine spells for 1d4
      rounds and be shaken for the same duration. If the save is successful, the
      target is instead shaken for only 1 round.  Additionally, your attacks are
      treated as epic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage
      reduction.</p>
