  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell allows you to turn a potion into a temporary pool of
    necromantic energy. Only a potion created using a conjuration (healing)
    spell can be affected by this spell. An affected potion turns dark red and
    reveals a necromantic aura if <i>detect magic</i> is cast on it while it
    remains under this spell's effects.  When you drink a potion affected by
    this spell, you do not gain the potion's normal effect. Instead, the first
    necromancy spell you cast within the next minute is cast at a higher caster
    level. The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell
    used to create the potion that <i>deathwine</i> affects. For example, a
    5th-level wizard who drinks <i>deathwine</i> made from a <i>potion of
    <i>cure serious wounds</i></i> would cast his next necromancy spell as an
    8th-level caster, as <i>cure serious wounds</i> i s a 3 rd-level spell.  In
    addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy)
    that drinks a potion affected by <i>deathwine</i> is healed of 1d8 points of
    damage. Any potion not imbibed before this spell's duration expires is
    destroyed at the end of the <i>deathwine</i>'s duration.</p>
