  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can read the entrails of a freshly killed animal or humanoid to
      gain an insight bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on one saving throw.
      Alternatively, by observing and interpreting the flights of birds, you may
      apply a +10 competence bonus on any one skill check. Finally, by charting
      marks in dirt or stone, or observing the behavior of sand when thrown into
      the wind, you gain a +4 insight bonus on one initiative check. These
      bonuses must be used during the next 24 hours and you must declare you are
      using the bonus before the check or save is made. Making a natural
      divination takes 10 minutes.</p>

      <p>You may use natural divination (in any combination) once per day plus
      one additional time per day for every four oracle levels you have
      attained.</p>
