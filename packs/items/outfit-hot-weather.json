This outfit typically consists of a loose linen robe and either a turban or loose head covering and veil. The outfit provides a +2 bonus on <em>Fortitude</em> saves to resist warm or hot weather. This does not stack with any bonuses gained from the @Compendium[pf1.skills.TXrxgrB2sQjppZFY]{Survival} skill.</p>"
