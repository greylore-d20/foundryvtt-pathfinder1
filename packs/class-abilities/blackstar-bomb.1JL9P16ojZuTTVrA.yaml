  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This bomb crushes the target like a void bomb, then repels nearby
      creatures with a burst of gravity. The target takes damage as if hit by a
      void bomb. All other creatures within 5 feet of the target are subject to
      a bull rush. The alchemist uses his alchemist class level in place of his
      Combat Maneuver Bonus, and adds his Intelligence modifier in place of his
      Strength or Dexterity modifier to resolve the bull rush attempts.
      Creatures moved by a blackstar bomb are pushed directly away from the
      targetâ€™s square. An alchemist must have the void bomb discovery to create
      blackstar bombs.</p>
