The tentacles deal 1d8 points of damage if the eidolon is Medium. Eidolons with the grab evolution that is linked to a tentacle mass can use that ability to grapple foes of up to the eidolonâ€™s size, and they can also use this evolution in place of the serpentine base form to qualify for the constrict evolution.&nbsp;</p>"
