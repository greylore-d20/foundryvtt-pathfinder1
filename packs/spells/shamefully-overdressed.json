    "shortDescription": "<p>The target sees its own attire as hopelessly out of fashion, ostentatious, and embarrassing, and is filled with a compulsion  to strip off all clothing. Each round, the target must spend a move action to remove a worn item that can be removed with a move action, dropping the item once it is removed. The target doesn't distinguish between magical and nonmagical items when removing them. Each round it removes an item as determined randomly from the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, headband, shoulders, or wrists. When determining randomly, don't include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don't include items that take more than one move action to remove. Though creatures can't have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove. If a target is wearing clothing that doesn't fit in any of those slots, such as breeches or a quiver, add it to the list of possibilities at the GM's discretion.  The target regards the discarded items with revulsion, and if forced to touch such an item (such as with a melee or ranged touch attack using the item as an improvised weapon), the target becomes sickened for 1d3 rounds. Other than the move action to remove items, the character can take whatever actions it chooses.</p>"
