      <p>When you cast this spell, a spectral force binds a broken weapon
      together, relieving the broken condition for a short time. While under the
      effects of this spell, an item with the broken condition suffers no
      adverse effects from that condition, and is treated as if it is not
      broken. The object regains no hit points, and damage can still destroy the
      object.</p>
