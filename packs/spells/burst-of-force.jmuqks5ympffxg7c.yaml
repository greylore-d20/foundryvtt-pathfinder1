    <p>With a burst of telekinetic force, you deal 1d6 points of force damage
    per caster level (maximum 15d6 points of damage) to all other creatures in
    the affected area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage taken by
    half. A creature that fails its Fortitude save must also succeed at a Reflex
    save or be knocked prone.</p>
