      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, the cavalier can ready his allies for impending danger. As a standard action, he can ready all allies within 30 feet of the danger ahead, granting a bonus on a single type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex or Will) that he chooses when he grants this boon. At any point in the next minute, when these allies fail a saving throw of that type, they can choose to reroll the saving throw with a +4 competence bonus as an immediate action, but must take the results of the reroll even if it is worse. He can use this ability up to three times per day, once for each type of saving throw.</p>"
