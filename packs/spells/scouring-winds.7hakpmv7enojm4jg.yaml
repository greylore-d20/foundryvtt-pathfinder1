  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell brings forth a windstorm of stinging sand that blocks all
    vision. You can move the storm up to 30 feet each round as a move action. 
    Any creature in the area takes 3d6 points of piercing damage each round. The
    area is considered a windstorm (see Table 13-10: Wind <b>Effect</b>s,
    <i>Core Rulebook</i> 439).  If a creature with spell resistance successfully
    resists this spell, it is unaffected by the winds and sand, but still unable
    to see within the area of the spell.</p>
