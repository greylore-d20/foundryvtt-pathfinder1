  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The crescent axe-blade of this polearm is attached to the haft at two
      points: the center of the blade attaches to a socket at the top of the
      haft, and the lower point of the blade attaches to a secondary mount
      point. The blade is often very long, sometimes almost as long as the haft.
      You gain a +2 bonus to your CMD to resist sunder attempts made against a
      bardiche.</p>
