  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You drain necromantic energy from an undead creature, inducing a sluggish
    stupor. The target becomes staggered. For the duration of the spell, dark
    wisps of energy seep out of the target creature. If the target already has
    the staggered condition (as a zombie does), it becomes dazed for 1 round
    instead.</p>
