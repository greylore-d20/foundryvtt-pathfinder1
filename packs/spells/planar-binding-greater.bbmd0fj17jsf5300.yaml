      <p>This spell functions like
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.y4b1zmhmsa0gvf06]{Lesser Planar Binding}, except
      that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three
      creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. Each
      creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and
      must be individually persuaded to aid you.</p>
