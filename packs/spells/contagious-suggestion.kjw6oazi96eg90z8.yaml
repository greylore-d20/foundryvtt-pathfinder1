  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.zqj5qzyl46af27v0]{suggestion}, except the
      target can pass on the enchantment to other targets. The target is
      compelled to communicate your <em>suggestion</em> to another creature,
      forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial
      target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the <em>suggestion</em>
      effect on the initial target isn't negated. If a secondary target fails,
      it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can
      further spread the <em>suggestion</em>. This spell can affect a total
      number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level. Creatures that
      save against this spell cannot be affected by that particular casting of
      contagious <em>suggestion</em> for 24 hours.</p>
