    value: >-
      <p>You reveal the true form of a magically disguised or transformed
      creature, whether the target’s transformation is physical (such as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.d40ia71c2eljm91k]{polymorph}) or illusory (such as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.oj36nfak6jc2s5ky]{disguise self}). The spell does
      not force the creature into its true form, but rather creates a perfect
      illusion of the creature’s true form that overlaps it and hides the
      disguised form completely, making the true form visible to all observers.
      For the duration of the spell, if the target changes shape or uses
      illusion to disguise its appearance, observers can still see its true
      form, though once the spell runs out any illusions or shape changes made
      by the target in the meantime immediately take effect. This spell does not
      reveal invisible creatures, overcome effects such as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.18kryvj2dfuymk9d]{blur} and
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.r190q9zxmei82lmv]{displacement}, or penetrate
      mundane disguises.</p>
