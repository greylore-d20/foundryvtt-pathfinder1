      <p><em>Tectonic communion</em> functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.icjrw9y6pa1uatlz]{commune with nature}
      with an even greater range. In outdoor or natural underground settings,
      the spell operates on a radius of 100 miles per caster level, extending
      even underground without penalty. For every 2 caster levels above 13th,
      you may glean an additional fact from the list presented in <em>commune
      with nature</em>. Communities, dungeons, and signs of civilization (such
      as roads, farms or other constructions and settlements) exist as dark and
      unknowable blots in your perception of the spell's area; you're aware of
      their location and existence, but can't discern any information regarding
      them.</p>
