  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target can observe for 1 full round a lock that he is aware of (or
    object that includes a lock, such as a chest or door) that is within 60 feet
    to automatically determine whether it is open, closed, or jammed. If the
    target creature is trained in Disable Device, by concentrating on a lock for
    3 rounds, he can also determine the quality of the lock (simple, average,
    good, or superior). This spell does not enable the target to see hidden
    locks, such as those on secret doors.</p>
