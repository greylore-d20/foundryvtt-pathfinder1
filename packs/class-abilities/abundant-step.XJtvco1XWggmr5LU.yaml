  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as
      if using the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{Dimension
      Door}. Using this ability is a <em>move action</em> that consumes 2 points
      from his ki pool. His <em>caster level</em> for this effect is equal to
      his monk level. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this
      ability.</p>
