  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent gains the ability to cast a 1st-level spell
      from the sorcerer/wizard spell list once per day as a spell-like ability
      for every 2 rogue levels she possesses. The rogue’s caster level for this
      ability is equal to her rogue level. The save DC for this spell is 11 +
      the rogue’s Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p>A rogue must have the minor magic rogue talent and an Intelligence
      score of at least 11 to select this talent.</p>
