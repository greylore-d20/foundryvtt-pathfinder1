  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action you can become a beacon of arcane energy until the
      end of your next turn. The aura emanates 15 feet from you. All arcane
      spells cast within the aura either gain a +1 bonus to their caster level
      or increase their saving throw DC by +1. The caster chooses the benefit
      when she casts the spell. You can use this ability a number of times per
      day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Hand of the Acolyte power of the Arcane
      Domain.</p>
