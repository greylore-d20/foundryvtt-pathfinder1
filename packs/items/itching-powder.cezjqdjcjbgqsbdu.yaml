      <p>This fine gray powder causes targets to suffer from uncontrollable
      itching until they spend at least 1 round washing it off. Throwing a
      packet of itching powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 10
      feet. Anyone standing on the square of impact must succeed on a DC 12
      <em>Fortitude</em> save to resist the powder, while those in adjacent
      squares must make a DC 8 <em>Fortitude</em> save. Creatures that fail the
      save take a -2 penalty on <em>attack rolls</em>, <em>saving throws</em>,
      skill checks, and ability checks.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft

      (M): For each packet of itching powder used as a power component, you may
      designate one creature in the area to be affected by itching powder (DC
      12).</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.zonwg3yt8pswj03y]{Repel
      Vermin} (M): The first <em>vermin</em> that enters the emanation is
      subject to the effects of itching powder (DC 15). Each packet of itching
      powder beyond the first means the spell affects another <em>vermin</em>
      that enters the emanation. A <em>swarm</em> of <em>vermin</em> counts as
      one <em>vermin</em> for the purpose of this
      effect.</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.vxi9c3xwa83xthka]{Summon
      Swarm} (M): Increase the <em>swarm's</em> distraction DC by 2.</li></ul>
