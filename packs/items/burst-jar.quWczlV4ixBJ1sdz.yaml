  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This simple clay pot has two sealed, airtight inner chambers containing
      alchemical liquids. The jar is thrown as a splash weapon. It shatters on
      impact, covering the target with a mixture of the two liquids. One round
      later on your turn, the liquids react and explode with concussive force.
      The target takes 1 point of sonic damage, is deafened for 1d4 rounds, and
      must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures
      within 5 feet of the explosion take 1 point of sonic damage. The target
      can use a full-round action to scrape or wash off the liquid before it
      detonates, depositing the material in its square or an adjacent square;
      the material detonates as normal, though the original target only takes
      damage as if it were within 5 feet of the explosion. Crafting this item is
      a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft
