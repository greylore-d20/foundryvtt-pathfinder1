She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit.</p>\n<p>At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>"
