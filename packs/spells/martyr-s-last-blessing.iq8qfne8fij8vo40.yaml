      <p>You charge your body with healing energy, which erupts from you if you
      are dying or are killed before 1 hour per level has passed. If you're
      brought below 0 hit points or killed (including by effects that kill
      without dealing damage, such as <i>phantasmal killer</i> and <i>power
      word</i> kill), the eruption of healing energy acts as <i>mass cure light
      wounds</i> on allies (other than you). Allies with the fewest Hit Dice are
      affected first. Among allies with equal HD, those closest to you are
      affected first. If the duration ends, the stored healing energy dissipates
      with no effect.</p>
