      <p>You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other
      spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired--whether
      by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this
      spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You can
      bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum
      load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature
      (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per
      three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a
      Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures
      to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of
      those creatures must be in contact with you.</p><p>If you arrive in a
      place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature
      traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random
      open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended
      location.</p><p>If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each
      creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and
      are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space
      within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an
      additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.</p>
