  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates an illusion of a stationary group of people milling
      about. They can be of any humanoid race or ethnicity you are familiar
      with, and they speak a language of your choice that you know. To anyone
      not paying close attention, their  conversations sound perfectly normal
      but are in fact repetitive and essentially meaningless. The crowd appears
      to be a group of typical citizens, and cannot duplicate any specific
      group, guild, or military squad.  The crowd affects movement and provides
      cover like a real crowd (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 436), b ut a
      nyone who disbelieves the illusion can move and attack through the crowd
      without impediment. Each round a creature enters or makes an attack
      through a crowd-filled square, it can attempt a save to disbelieve the
      illusion. Similarly, any creature that spends a round listening to or
      talking to the crowd can attempt a save to disbelieve the illusion. If the
      group is placed in any terrain other than urban, each creature attempting
      a save to disbelieve the spell gains a +5 bonus on the save.</p>
