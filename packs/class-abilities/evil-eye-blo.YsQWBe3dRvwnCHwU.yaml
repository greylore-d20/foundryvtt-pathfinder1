    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can curse an opponent with a wicked glance. As a
      standard action, you can afflict one target within 30 feet that you can
      see, causing it to take a â€“2 penalty to AC and on attack rolls for 1 round
      per class level or until the target hits you with an attack. The target
      can negate this effect with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half
      your bloodrager level + your Charisma modifier). You can use this ability
      a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
