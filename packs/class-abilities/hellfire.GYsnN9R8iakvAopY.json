Those caught in the area of your blast receive a <em>Reflex</em> save for half damage. Good creatures that fail their saves are <em>shaken</em> for a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer level. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier. At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day. This power has a range of 60 feet.</p>"
