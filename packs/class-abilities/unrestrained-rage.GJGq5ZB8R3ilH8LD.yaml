  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian is immune to paralysis. If the barbarian is
      targeted by an effect that would cause her to become paralyzed, she can
      enter a rage as an immediate action, as long as she still has rounds of
      rage remaining.</p>

      <p> A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>
