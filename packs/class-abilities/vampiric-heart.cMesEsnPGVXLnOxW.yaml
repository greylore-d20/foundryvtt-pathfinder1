    value: >-
      <p>The vampire hunter gains <em>energy resistance</em> equal to half his
      level against cold and electricity. Additionally, the vampire hunter’s
      heartbeat is undetectable. Any ability that detects or identifies the
      living, such as the <em>lifesense</em> ability, does not perceive him. At
      16th level, once per day when reduced to 0 or fewer <em>hit points</em>
      while this focus is activated, the vampire hunter immediately turns
      gaseous (as the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous
      Form}) for up to a number of rounds equal to half his level and he gains a
      number of <em>temporary hit points</em> equal to half his level. The
      vampire hunter can leave <em>gaseous form</em> at any time without losing
      these <em>temporary hit points</em>. This effect ends after these rounds
      have elapsed, after the vampire hunter loses the <em>temporary hit
      points</em>, or once this focus is no longer active, at which point the
      vampire hunter immediately becomes corporeal and loses these <em>temporary
      hit points</em>. If he has not received <em>healing</em> in the interim,
      this returns the vampire hunter to the number of <em>hit points</em> he
      had after the attack or effect that triggered this ability.</p>
