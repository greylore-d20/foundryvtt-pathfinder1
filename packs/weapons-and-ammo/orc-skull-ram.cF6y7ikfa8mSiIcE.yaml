  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon consists of a wooden log with a shoulder strap to carry
      some of the weight. The name comes from the orc tradition of making the
      ram's head out of a large skull. On a successful critical hit with a skull
      ram, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to bull rush your opponent as
      a free action.</p>
