  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a character with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack
      that deals sneak attack damage, any nonmagical light sources worn or
      carried by the creature (such as lit torches, lanterns, or sunrods) are
      automatically extinguished. Once per day, the character can use this
      ability to also attempt a dispel check (as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{dispel magic}) against
      any magical sources of light a target carries, using her character level
      as the caster level.</p>
