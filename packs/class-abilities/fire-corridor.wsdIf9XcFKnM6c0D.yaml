      <p><b>Element</b> fire; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 5;
      <b>Burn</b> 1</p>

      <p>You create a passage through a fire or pool of lava. The passage is 5
      feet wide and 8 feet high. It is 10 feet long, plus 5 feet longer for
      every 3 kineticist levels you have. Any heat generated by the fire or lava
      through which the passage passes is radiated outwards, making the passage
      comfortable and safe.</p>

      <p>The passage lasts for 1 hour, though you can end the effect at any time
      as a free action. If this effect ends while a creature is inside the
      tunnel, that creature is affected by the fire or lava as normal.</p>
