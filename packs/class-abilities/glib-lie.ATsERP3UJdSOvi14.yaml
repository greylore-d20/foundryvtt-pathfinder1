  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truthdetecting magic. A creature
      using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster
      level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist’s class level to succeed
      (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure
      means the magic doesn’t detect the mesmerist’s lies or force him to speak
      only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness
      spell’s bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
