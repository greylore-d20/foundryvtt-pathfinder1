      <p>These oversized shoes are worn over normal footwear. They create
      footprints or bootprints that look like those left by another creature.
      Each pair creates a specific type of footprint, such as tiger, orc,
      goblin, or ogre. When walking with these shoes, you may make a Survival
      check; the check result is the Survival DC for anyone trying to determine
      whether the tracks are what they appear to be.</p>
