      weapon is a steel roller nearly 10 feet wide. Handles or a harness project
      from the axle, allowing four orcs or one Large beast to push the crushing
      wheel from behind. As a full-round action, its crew can roll the crushing
      wheel over creatures in front of it. This functions as the trample monster
      ability except as noted here. Creatures that are overrun fall prone and
      take 4d6 points of damage. Targets that succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving
      throw take only half damage and avoid falling prone. A crushing wheel has
      a hardness of 10 and 100 hit points.</p><p>A crushing wheel is a Large
