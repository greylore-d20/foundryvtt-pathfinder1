    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, a vampire hunterâ€™s resolve infects his traveling
      companions, increasing how many hours the group can spend traveling in a
      day. Every day the vampire hunter can allow a number of companions equal
      to half his level (plus their mounts) to also benefit from his relentless
      ability. The vampire hunter rolls saving throws to determine whether the
      group can carry on in its extended travels.</p>
