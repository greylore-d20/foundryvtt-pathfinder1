    value: >-
      <p>This spell causes a small cloud of searing, choking ash to appear
      around the face of the target. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude
      saving throw or take 1d6 points of fire damage and be
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.A9KUpd2bsdZZsQqj]{blinded}.
      The victim must make a new save against damage and blindness for each
      round the spell persists. The target must have a discernable anatomy and
      no more than one head in order to be blinded. Undead, constructs, and
      creatures without eyes or who don’t rely on sight to sense their
      surroundings can be damaged by this spell, but not blinded.</p><p>A
      moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the ash cloud in 2 rounds; a strong wind
      (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.</p><p>This spell does not
      function underwater.</p>
