      <p>You become invisible (as <i>greater invisibility</i>, a glamer), and at
      the same time, an illusory double of you (as <i>major image</i>, a
      figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double
      moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you
      direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after
      the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over
      your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you
      turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different
      directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if
      it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend
      to do so.</p><p>The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon
      it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory
      double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration
      expires. The <i>greater invisibility</i> lasts for 1 round per level,
      regardless of concentration.</p>
