    value: >-
      <p>Invisible layers of solid force surround and protect the target,
      granting that target a +2 armor bonus to AC. Additionally, the first 5
      points of lethal damage the target takes from each attack are converted
      into nonlethal damage. Against attacks that already deal nonlethal damage,
      the target gains DR 5/-. Once this spell has converted 5 points of damage
      to nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), the spell is
      discharged.</p>
