      <p>You borrow one of the target's known skills. After touching the
      subject, you can make a single check with the chosen skill using the
      subject's skill ranks, but modified by your own key ability.</p><p>If you
      take longer than the spell's duration to make the check or the check
      requires more time, then it fails and you must use your own skill ranks
      (if any). If the borrowed skill is a class skill for you, you gain the +3
      bonus on checks using that skill.</p>
