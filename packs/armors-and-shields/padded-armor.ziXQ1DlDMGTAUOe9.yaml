  description:
    value: >-
      <p>More than simple clothing, padded armor combines heavy, quilted cloth
      and layers of densely packed stuffing to create a cheap and basic
      protection. It is typically worn by those not intending to face lethal
      combat or those who wish their maneuverability to be impacted as little as
      possible.</p>
