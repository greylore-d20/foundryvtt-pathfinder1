      <p>As a standard action, you can send forth a 20-foot line of magma. Any
      creature in this line takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every
      2 wizard levels you have. A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your
      wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) halves this damage. In
      addition, the ground in this area remains molten for another 1d4 rounds.
      Creatures that begin their turns in the area can move out that turn
      without penalty, but those that enter the area each take 1d6 points of
      fire damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3
      + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
