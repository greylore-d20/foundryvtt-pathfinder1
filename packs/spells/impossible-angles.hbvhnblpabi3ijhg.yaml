    value: >-
      <p>You cause the surrounding area to appear to distort. The angles and
      corners of the area subtly twist and contort, creating unnatural and
      impossible shapes. Any creature entering the area must succeed at a Will
      save or become disoriented. Disoriented characters treat the area as
      difficult terrain and are sickened. In addition, whenever a disoriented
      creature uses an action to move (including taking a 5-foot step if it can
      do so in difficult terrain), roll 1d8 to see which direction it moves, in
      a similar manner to determining where a splash weapon lands on a miss
      (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 202). On a 1, the creature moves in
      its intended direction, with 2 through 8 rotating around the creature's
      starting square in a clockwise direction. Only the creature's first  5
      feet of movement each round are affected in this way-it can move normally
      for any remaining movement, either from the same action or from later
      actions, as the creature acclimatizes to the distortion. An affected
      creature can attempt a new Will save each round to end the disoriented
      effect. A creature that leaves the area and re-enters must attempt the
      saving throw again, even if it succeeded at its initial save.</p>
