      <p>This spell enables the subjects to stand watch or keep vigil throughout
      the night without any ill effects. The subjects suffer no fatigue and gain
      all the usual benefits of a full night's rest. The subjects gain hit
      points as though from resting, wizards may prepare their spells as though
      they had slept for 8 hours, and so on. Effects that rely on actual
      <i>sleep</i> or dreaming are ineffective, though the subjects are still
      susceptible to effects that would put them to <i>sleep</i>, such as
      <i>sleep</i> or <i>deep slumber</i>. Any vigorous activity, including
      fighting, immediately ends the effect, and the affected creatures must
      either have the spell cast on them again or <i>sleep</i> for the remaining
      hours to avoid fatigue and gain the benefits of a full night's rest.</p>
