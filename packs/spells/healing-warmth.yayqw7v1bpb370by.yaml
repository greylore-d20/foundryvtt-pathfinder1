  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell grants you temporary immunity to fire damage as
      <i>protection from energy</i>. As a standard action, you may sacrifice 12
      points of remaining energy absorption from the spell to heal a touched
      creature of 1d8 points of damage. Healing a creature provokes an attack of
      opportunity. When the spell has absorbed 12 points of fire damage per
      caster level (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is
      discharged.</p>
