    value: >-
      <p>This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack
      normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic
      that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, solid fog, slow, and
      <i>web.</i> All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the target
      automatically fail. The subject automatically succeeds on any combat
      maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a
      pin.</p><p>The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally
      while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or
      with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that
      the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The <i>freedom of
      movement</i> spell does not, however, grant water breathing.</p>
