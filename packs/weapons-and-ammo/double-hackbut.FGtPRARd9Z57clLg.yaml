      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><b>Damage</b> 2d10 (small), 2d12 (medium);
      <b>Critical</b> x4; <b>Range</b> 50 ft.; <b>Type</b> B and P</p>

      <p><b>Misfire</b> 1-2 (5 ft.); <b>Capacity</b> 2</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This double-length rifle uses a pair of trunnions to mount its barrel
      into a swiveling mechanism fastened to the top of a lightweight,
      twowheeled carriage. It takes a full-round action to set up the carriage.
      The carriage has a hind leg, allowing the wielder to wheel the device
      about and immediately prop it for stability during combat.</p>

      <p>Unlike other two-handed firearms, you must fire the double hackbut
      while it is mounted, or else firing it imparts a -4 penalty on attack
      rolls and the recoil knocks you prone. A Large or larger creature can fire
      a double hackbut one size smaller than itself without the gun's mounting
      as a normal two-handed weapon and without the danger of being knocked
      prone, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately sized
      weapon.</p>
