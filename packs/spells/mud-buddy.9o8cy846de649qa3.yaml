  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a Small minion out of mud, and it obeys your commands. The
    <i>mud buddy</i> has AC 12, 10 hit points, Strength 5, and a speed of 30
    feet. It can perform any tasks an <i>unseen servant</i> can, plus any
    similar tasks its Strength allows (it's able to lift up to 50 pounds), but
    instead of walking on water, it gains a swim speed of 30 feet.  You can
    command a <i>mud buddy</i> to move up to 5 feet and trip an opponent (CMB =
    your caster level + your spellcasting ability score modifier). After the
    trip attempt is resolved, the spell ends.  When the spell ends, the <i>mud
    buddy</i> reverts to a patch of wet earth.</p>
