      <h4>Horn, signal</h4>

      <p class="source"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1115</em></p>

      <p>Sounding a horn requires a DC 10 <em>Perform</em> (wind instruments)
      check and can convey concepts such as "Attack!", "Help!", "Advance!",
      "Retreat!", "Fire!", and, "Alarm!" The report of a signal horn can be
      clearly heard (<em>Perception</em> DC 0) up to a half-mile distant. For
      each quarter-mile beyond, <em>Perception</em> checks to hear the horn
      suffer a -1 penalty.</p>
