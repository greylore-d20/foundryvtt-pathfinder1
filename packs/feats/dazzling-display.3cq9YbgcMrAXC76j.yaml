      enemies.</em><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Weapon Focus, proficiency
      with the selected weapon.<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: While wielding the
      weapon in which you have Weapon Focus, you can perform a bewildering show

      all foes within 30 feet who can see your display.<h3>Combat
      Trick</h3><p>When wielding a melee weapon with which you have Weapon
      Focus, you can make a single melee attack as a standard action against a
      foe. If the attack hits, you can select any number of foes within 30 feet
      who saw the attack, including that foe. Spend 2 stamina points per foe you
      have selected, then attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize those foes.
