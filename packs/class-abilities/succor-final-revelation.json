You can apply any one of the following metamagic feats to any spell you cast that targets one or more of your allies without increasing the level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. You do not need to have these feats to use this ability, and you can use this ability any number of times per day on any spell that can be affected by the listed metamagic feats.</p>"
