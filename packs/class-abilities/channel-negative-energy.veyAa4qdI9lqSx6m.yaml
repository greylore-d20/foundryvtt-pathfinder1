    value: >-
      <p>When an antipaladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural
      ability to channel negative energy like a <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Cleric">cleric</a>.
      Using this ability consumes two uses of his touch of corruption ability.
      An antipaladin uses his level as his effective cleric level when
      channeling negative energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
