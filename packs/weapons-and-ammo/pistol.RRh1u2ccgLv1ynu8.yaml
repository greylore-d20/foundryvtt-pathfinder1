      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>The basic single-shot pistol is one of the most common firearms,
      although in most campaigns it is still rare enough to be an object of envy
      or curiosity to most. As such, it can take a variety of different forms,
      from wildly ornate masterpieces in the shape of fire-breathing dragons to
      the more common woodhandled pistols, or nothing more than a simple metal
      tube with a triggering device.</p>

      <p>A pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single
      alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p>
