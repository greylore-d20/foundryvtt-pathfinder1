  description:
    value: >-
      <p>If she spends 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the arcanist can
      predict the weather in her current location for the next 24 hours. The
      arcanistâ€™s prediction is always accurate, but it cannot account for spells
      or supernatural effects that might alter conditions. In addition, she
      gains a bonus equal to half her arcanist level on Fortitude saves against
      severe weather for the next 24 hours. She can share this benefit with a
      number of allies equal to her Charisma bonus.</p>
