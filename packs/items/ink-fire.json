      "value": "<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p>\n<p>This rich yellow ink reacts with a creature's body heat to create a flickering, flame-like glow. It takes 10 minutes to apply fire ink, and 1 dose covers an approximately hand-sized area. Once applied, the ink glows as a candle for 24 hours. Four or more doses applied to the same part of the body glow as a torch for 24 hours. The alchemical reaction of the ink to the target's skin and body heat is painful and irritating, giving the target the <em>sickened</em> condition while the glow lasts. A DC 15 <em>Heal</em> check can temporarily soothe these sensations, negating the <em>sickened</em> condition for 1 hour. Creatures immune or resistant to fire are immune to this sickening effect. Ifrits are especially known for their fondness for fire ink, and ifrit fire-dancers often decorate their skin with flaming designs before performing. A concentrated version of the ink costs 10 times as much and can be used to make permanently glowing tattoos.</p>"
