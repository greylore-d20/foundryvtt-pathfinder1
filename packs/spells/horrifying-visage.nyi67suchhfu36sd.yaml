      <p>You channel residual feelings of terror into the minds of creatures
      within the area, causing those fears to manifest when confronted with a
      specific object. All creatures in the area must succeed at a Will save or
      acquire a phobia (<i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i> 250) for the
      spell's duration. You choose one kind of creature, object, or image within
      the area of the spell when it is cast that triggers the phobia. The kind
      of creature, object, or image that triggers the phobia must be named
      specifically. A creature type or subtype is not specific enough. The
      phobia can be cured using traditional methods of treating insanity, and
      spells or effects that prevent possession or mind control suppress the
      phobia for their duration. Each time the phobia is triggered in an
      affected creature, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that
      round.</p>
