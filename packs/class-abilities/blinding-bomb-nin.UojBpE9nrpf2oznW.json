      "value": "<p>Whenever the ninja throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the cloud must make a Fortitude save or be blinded by the black smoke for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja’s level + the ninja’s Charisma modifier. This trick cannot be combined with a choking bomb, but the ninja can combine a blinding bomb with a poison bomb. The ninja must have the choking bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.</p>"
