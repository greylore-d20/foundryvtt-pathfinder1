  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the cavalier receives
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.3S01BGUthIbp3Hju]{Stand Still} as a bonus feat, even
      if he does not meet the prerequisites. Instead of making a combat maneuver
      check to stop the creature from moving, a cavalier with this ability can
      elect to make a normal attack instead. If the attack hits and deals
      damage, the target must stop moving, just as if the cavalier had made a
      successful combat maneuver check.</p>
