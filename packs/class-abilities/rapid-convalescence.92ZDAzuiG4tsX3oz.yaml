      <p>You reduce the number of consecutive successful saves needed to recover
      from a disease or poison by 1 (to a minimum of 1). Additionally, you can

      enhancement bonus equal to that spell slotâ€™s level on your next save to
      resist the effects of poison or disease, provided the save is attempted
      within 1 minute per level of spell expended.</p>
