This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength check. <b>Price</b> 1 gp; <b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.</p>\n<p><b>FYI</b>: The <em>Equipment Trick</em> feat provides a number of options for using this item in combat.</p>\n<p><b>Silk Rope</b> This 50-foot length of silk rope has 4 hit points and can be broken with a DC 24 Strength check. <b>Price</b> 10 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p>\n<p><b>Bloodvine Rope</b> This 50-foot length of tough, lightweight rope is made from alchemically treated bloodvine, a rare scarlet-colored vine that grows only in warm jungle environments.
