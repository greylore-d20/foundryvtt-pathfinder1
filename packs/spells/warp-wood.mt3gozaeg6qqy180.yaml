  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness,
    form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring
    a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak.
    Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a -4 penalty
    on attack rolls.</p><p>You may warp one Small or smaller object or its
    equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a
    Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and
    a Colossal object as 32.</p><p>Alternatively, you can un<i>warp wood</i>
    (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. <i>Make whole</i>,
    on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.</p><p>You can
    combine multiple consecutive <i>warp wood</i> spells to warp (or unwarp) an
    object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the
    object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.</p>
