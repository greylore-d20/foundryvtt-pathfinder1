    value: >-
      <p>A pint of lamp oil burns for 6 hours in a common lantern or lamp. You
      can also use a flask of lamp oil as a <em>splash weapon</em>. Use the
      rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a <em>full-round
      action</em> to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a
      50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.</p>

      <p>You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet
      square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2
      rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the
      area.</p>
