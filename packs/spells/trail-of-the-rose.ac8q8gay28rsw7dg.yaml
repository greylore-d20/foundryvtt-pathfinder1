      <p>This spell creates an illusory trail in the form of a misty and visible
      scent coming from the rose used as this spell's material component. When
      you cast this spell, the scent of the rose leaves a faint pink-tinged
      illusion that ripples and flows in the area. Only you and up to six
      creatures you designate upon casting the spell can see the illusion. To
      designate a creature, you must know it well. It is not enough simply to
      have met that creature once or heard of the creature.</p><p>When you move,
      this illusory scent leaves a trail, though there are no telltale signs of
      which direction you moved if creatures designated by this spell find a
      middle section of the trail. This is typically used to create backtracking
      method for the caster's handpicked allies, useful for navigating in and
      out of mazes or labyrinthine cave complexes without leaving behind an
      obvious trail.</p>
