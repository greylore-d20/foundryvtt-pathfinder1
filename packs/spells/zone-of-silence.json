This effect is centered on you and moves with you.</p><p>Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful DC 20 Linguistics check to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a <i>zone of silence</i>.</p>",
