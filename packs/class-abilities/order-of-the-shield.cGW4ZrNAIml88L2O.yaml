  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Cavaliers who join the order of the shield devote their lives to
      protecting the common folk, from the simple farmer to the honest
      craftsman. These cavaliers stand before the tide, protecting the innocent
      from roving marauders and hungry monsters.<p><b>Edicts:</b> The cavalier
      must protect the lives and prosperity of the common folk, shielding them
      from the deprivations of those who would seek to cause them harm or
      exploit them. He must give charity when it is warranted and aid when
      needed. He must take no action that would cause harm or hardship to those
      who cannot defend themselves.<p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever an order of the
      shield cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on
      attack rolls made against the target of his challenge if the target makes
      an attack against a target other than the cavalier. This bonus lasts for 1
      minute. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier
      possesses.<p><b>Skills:</b> An order of the shield cavalier adds Heal
      (Wis) and Knowledge (local) (Int) to his list of class skills. Whenever an
      order of the shield cavalier uses the Heal skill on a creature other than
      himself, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level
      (minimum +1).</p>
