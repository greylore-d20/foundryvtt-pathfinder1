      <p><em>You have mastered the nagaji warrior technique of spitting venom
      into your opponentâ€™s eyes.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      Nagaji.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full-round action, you can
      spit poison up to 10 feet as a ranged touch attack. If you hit, the target
      must make a successful Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. The DC
      of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your total Hit Dice + your Constitution
      modifier. You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time
      per day for every three Hit Dice you have.</p><h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>When
      you spit poison, you can spend up to 5 stamina points. For each stamina
      point spent, you can increase the range of the attack by 5 feet.</p>
