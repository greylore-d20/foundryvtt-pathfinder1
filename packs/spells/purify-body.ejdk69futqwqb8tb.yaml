      <p>You align the target's chakras and soothe any unwanted imperfections
      found within its physical form, leaving its body pristine and without any
      pain or weakness.  You restore a number of hit points to the creature
      equal to 3d8 + 1 per caster level (maximum +20). If the healing would
      cause the target to exceed its maximum hit points, the target immediately
      gains half the excess healing from this spell as temporary hit points that
      last for 1 hour. These temporary hit points are lost first when the target
      takes damage (although some temporary hit points are lost even before
      these temporary hit points, such as the temporary hit points from the
      shell of succor oracle mystery, described on page 21, or the shell of
      succor hex granted by the restoration spirit specialization and described
      on page 27). This spell also ends any pain effects, removes all physical
      ability score damage (from Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), and
      removes the following conditions: blinded, dazzled, deafened, nauseated,
      paralyzed, and sickened.</p>
