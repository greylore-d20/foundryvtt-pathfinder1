      <p>You draw upon the memories of the targets to create a visual disguise
      for yourself that only they can see. When you cast the spell, you choose
      an emotion from the table below. Each target perceives you as a creature
      it feels that way toward. If it doesn't feel that way toward anyone, it
      instead perceives you as a stranger with features likely to  evoke that
      emotion (e.g., if you choose respect, a guard who was taught to respect
      her elders but who currently knows no elders might see you as an elderly
      version of yourself). Since you don't know how you will appear to each
      target, you must match your actions and statements to fit with the
      illusion as best you can. While the spell grants a +10 bonus on Disguise
      checks like <i>disguise self</i> does, you also take a -5 penalty on
      Disguise checks until you can get a sense of who the target thinks you
      are. Each target who fails to disbelieve the phantasm and is fooled by
      your Disguise check takes a -2 penalty on Sense Motive checks to notice
      your lies, and each emotion choice grants you an additional benefit
      against such targets, as listed in the table below. </p><table
