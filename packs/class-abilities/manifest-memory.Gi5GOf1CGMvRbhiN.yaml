  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you can overlay portions of your mindscape onto the
      world around you. This functions as the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.82vi1xife3nlu8a0]{Mirage Arcana} spell, except all
      structures and terrain created must be places appearing within your
      mindscape. You can use this ability at will, but you can maintain only a
      single manifest memory at any one time. You can allow any creature you can
      see who has previously entered your mindscape to automatically disbelieve
      the illusion as a <em>free action</em>.</p>
