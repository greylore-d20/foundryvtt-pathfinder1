  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You call the spirits of two ancestors to manifest in the mortal world
      and attack your enemies. Each appears as a transparent image of a
      powerful, wise dwarf armed with a traditional dwarven weapon of your
      choice. These spirits move and attack at your direction, each having the
      abilities of a <i>spiritual weapon</i>, except they can attack different
      targets and deal physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing,
      according to the weapon the spirit wields) instead of force damage. Like
      creatures conjured with a <i>summon monster</i> spell, your ancestors are
      not harmed if these manifestations are destroyed.</p>
