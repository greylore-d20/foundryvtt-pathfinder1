            <p>A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot
            radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional
            20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light
            becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in
            normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it
            as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage
            equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire
            damage.</p>

            <p>This chunk of crystal shines with the colors of the rainbow. A
            prismatic crystal can be used as a focus for the read aura occult
            skill unlock to reduce the time needed to read an aura from 10
            minutes to 5 minutes. When held by psychic creatures, these crystals
            also emit light in a small area, increasing the light level in a
            10-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light, and dim
            light becomes normal light). A prismatic crystal can’t increase the
            light level above normal light.</p>
