    "shortDescription": "<p>This minor curse interferes with the target’s ability to speak. On a failed save, the target has difficulty stringing words together. Only with great concentration can he communicate intelligibly. Speaking in combat becomes a move-equivalent action rather than a free action. If the target attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, he has a 50% chance of making an error and losing the spell. Even if he can successfully cast a spell, doing so takes 1 round if the spell’s normal casting time is less than 1 round. If the spell’s casting time is usually 1 round or longer, its casting time doubles (up until the end of <em>impede speech</em>). <em>Impede speech</em> cannot be dispelled, but @Compendium[pf1.spells.myg2b9ww43nnlbr2]{break enchantment}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.s2p7a4biy7bl4ks2]{limited wish}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.suel7sgnztenv551]{miracle}, @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.o87h8gjxevcbztgd]{remove curse}, or @Compendium[pf1.spells.nnj51dwfkwd15ngj]{wish} can end it prematurely.</p>"
