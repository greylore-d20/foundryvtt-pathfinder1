      <p>The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and
      breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on
      its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.
      This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
      A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A
      swimmer can't swim and may drown.</p>
