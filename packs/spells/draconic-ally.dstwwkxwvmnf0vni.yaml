  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a semi-living intelligent draconic servant that loyally
      obeys and serves you. Treat this servant as a pseudodragon with all of the
      abilities granted by one of the following spells: <i>Form of the Alien
      Dragon I</i>, <i>form of the dragon I</i>, or <i>Form of the Exotic Dragon
      I</i>. Your <i>draconic ally</i> can use its breath weapon once per day.
      Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell's range, and can
      go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command. The
      <i>draconic ally</i> speaks one language of your choice that you know. You
      cannot have more than one <i>draconic ally</i> at a time. As long as a
      previous ally exists, you cannot successfully cast  this spell again. If
      you have a breath weapon, you can cast this spell as a standard action by
      expending one use of your breath weapon as a free action when you cast the
      spell.  Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship Apsu or
      Dahak add <i>draconic ally</i> to their spell lists as a 3rd-level
      spell.</p>
