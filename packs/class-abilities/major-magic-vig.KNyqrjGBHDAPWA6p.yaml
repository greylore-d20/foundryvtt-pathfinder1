      <p><strong>Source</strong> Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27</p><p>A vigilante
      with this talent gains the ability to cast a 1st-level spell drawn from
      the same spell list as the minor magic talent. The vigilante can cast this
      spell once per day as a spell-like ability for every 4 vigilante levels he
      has. The caster level for this ability is equal to the vigilante’s level.
      The save DC for this spell is equal to 10 + the vigilante’s Intelligence
      modifier (for psychic, sorcerer/wizard, and witch spells), Wisdom (for
      cleric, druid, and shaman spells), or Charisma (for bard spells). A
      vigilante must be at least 4th level, have the minor magic vigilante
      talent, and have a score of at least 11 in the appropriate ability to
      select this talent.</p>
