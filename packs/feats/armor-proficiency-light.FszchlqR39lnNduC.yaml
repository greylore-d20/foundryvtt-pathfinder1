      which he is not proficient applies its armor check penalty to attack rolls
      and to all skill checks that involve moving.<p><strong>Special</strong>:
      All characters except monks, sorcerers, and wizards automatically have
      Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
