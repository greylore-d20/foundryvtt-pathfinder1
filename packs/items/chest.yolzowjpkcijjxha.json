Metal bands, usually bronze to prevent rusting, are strapped around the treasure chest for extra reinforcement, and the lock is also made of bronze. A treasure chest uses the same statistics as an ordinary wooden chest of its same size, but its <em>hit points</em> increase by 25% and its break DC increases by 2. Treasure chests stand up better to water travel and to being buried compared to ordinary chests.</p>"
