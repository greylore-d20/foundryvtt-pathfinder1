      <p>You can make a melee touch attack to send a pulse into the target,
      interfering with the magic that endows it with life. If the construct
      fails its saving throw, it becomes helpless, but it receives a new save
      each round at the end of its turn to shake off the effect. If the
      construct is normally immune to magic, the pulse is less effective and the
      construct receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw.</p>
