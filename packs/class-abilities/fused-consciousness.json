She also gains the skill ranks and bonus to mind-affecting spells granted by the spirit’s emotional focus, even when her phantom is manifested. Lastly, she can shunt the effect of a mind-affecting effect into the consciousness of her phantom as the shared consciousness ability even when the phantom is manifested, but doing so causes the phantom to immediately retreat back into the spiritualist’s consciousness.</p>"
