      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This arrow ends in a crystalline bubble filled with a viscous
      alchemical dyeing agent.</p>

      <p>Firing a dye arrow is a ranged touch attack; a creature struck by a dye
      arrow takes no damage but is splashed with enough black, blue, green, or
      red marker dye (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment </em>104) to coat
      about 1 square foot.</p>

      <p>The stain caused by marker dye cannot be washed off except with magic
      for the first 72 hours, but fades completely after 2 weeks.</p>
