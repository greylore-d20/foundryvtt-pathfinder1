  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, you can create a 30-foot-radius aura of normal light.
      Allies in this aura gain a +2 insight bonus on skill checks. This counts
      as a 2nd-level light effect for the purpose of countering or dispelling
      darkness effects. You can use this aura for a number of rounds per day
      equal to your inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>
