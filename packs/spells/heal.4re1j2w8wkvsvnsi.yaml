      <p><em>Heal</em> enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to
      wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the
      following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage,
      blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted,
      fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and
      stunned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to
      a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.</p><p><em>Heal</em> does not remove
      negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score
      points.</p><p>If used against an undead creature, <em>heal</em> instead
      acts like
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.dvwyzofd0yifs1ac]{harm}.</em></p>
