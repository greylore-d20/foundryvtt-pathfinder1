      <p>All chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good creatures
      within the area of this spell suffer the following conditions, based on
      their Hit Dice. </p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>Hit
      Dice</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>Equal to caster
      level</td><td>Sickened</td></tr><tr><td>Up to caster level -
      1</td><td>Sickened, staggered</td></tr><tr><td>Up to caster level -
      5</td><td>Nauseated, sickened, staggered</td></tr><tr><td>Up to caster
      level - 10</td><td>Killed, nauseated, sickened,
      staggered</td></tr></tbody></table> The effects are concurrent. A creature
      can attempt a Will save to reduce or negate the effects. If subject to
      multiple effects, the creature rolls once and applies the result to each
      effect. <br /><b>Sickened</b>: The creature is sickened for 1d4 rounds
      (Will negates). <br /><b>Staggered</b>: The creature is staggered for 2d4
      rounds, or for 1d4 rounds on a successful Will save. <br
      /><b>Nauseated</b>: The creature is nauseated for 1d10 minutes, or for 1d4
      rounds on a successful Will save. <br /><b>Killed</b>: Living creatures
      die, and undead creatures are destroyed. On a successful Will save, the
      creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
      (maximum +25).  Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast
      this spell, all chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good
      extraplanar creatures within the area are banished to their home planes
      (Will negates, at a -4 penalty). Creatures so banished cannot return for
      at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the
      creatures hear the <i>arbitrament</i>.  Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed
      your caster level are unaffected by <i>arbitrament</i>.<p></p>
