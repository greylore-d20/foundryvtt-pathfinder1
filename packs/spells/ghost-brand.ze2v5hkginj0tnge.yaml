  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You alter the fundamental substance of a single object up to 2 cubic feet
    per level in size and at least one size category smaller than the target
    creature, causing it to become shadowy and intangible, as though made out of
    quasi-real shadowstuff. You link the intangible item to the target's flesh
    by making a brand shaped like the item on the target's skin. The intangible
    item merges with the target's flesh and is contained within the target's
    body, moving with the target wherever it goes. The creature can retrieve the
    item or reabsorb it as a full-round action, and can do so as many times as
    it wants. When worn or wielded by the target, the item regains its solidity
    and functions normally, though the target can't drop or remove the item
    (other than by using the full-round action), nor can it be disarmed or
    stolen. If the item is destroyed, the spell ends. If the <i>ghost brand</i>
    spell is dispelled while the object is inside the target's body,  the object
    bursts out of the target's flesh, dealing 3d6 points of piercing and
    slashing damage to the target that bypasses DR, as well as 1d6 points of
    bleed damage.</p>
