      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to curse a living creature within 30 feet with your psychic magic. You can choose one of the following effects: memory lapse, mental block, or pain confusion.</p>\n<p>If you choose memory lapse, the target loses its memory of the past 1 hour per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>If you choose mental block, you can proscribe one specific action, such as attacking with a type of weapon, casting a specific spell, or something else suitably specific (subject to the GM’s discretion). The target can’t take that action without first succeeding at a Will save. If it fails, it can take other actions instead. If it attempts the prohibited action again on subsequent rounds, it gains a cumulative +2 bonus on the save until it succeeds.</p>\n<p>If you select pain confusion, the creature is confused for 1d4 rounds whenever it is damaged by a critical hit. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. This effect lasts for 1 day per occultist level you possess.</p>\n<p>A creature can’t be under the effects of more than one psychic curse at a time. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p>"
