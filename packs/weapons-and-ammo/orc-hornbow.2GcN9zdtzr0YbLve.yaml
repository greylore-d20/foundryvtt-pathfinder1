  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Larger even than a longbow, these bows are often made from the horns of
      great beasts. Though they have a shorter range than other bows, their
      greater destructive power is highly favored by orcs and their kin. All
      hornbows are composite bows and can be modified to benefit from high
      Strength scores in the same way as other composite bows. Any effect that
      applies to both longbows and shortbows also applies to hornbows.</p>
