  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.fmuea6pmgrylbux7]{arcane eye}, except
      that it uses an <em>ioun stone</em> as a visible scrying sensor. The
      <em>ioun stone</em> moves at the same rate as an <em>arcane eye</em>, and
      may pass through holes or spaces as small as 2 inches in diameter. It can
      enter another plane of existence using a <em>gate</em> or similar portal,
      but the caster loses contact with the sensor should this occur. The
      enhanced <em>ioun stone</em> has AC 24, 10 hp, hardness 5, fly speed 30
      (perfect), and a +16 Stealth bonus. The stone does not provide you with
      its normal benefits while you are using it as a scrying sensor.</p>
