      <p>As long as the target is at least one size category smaller than you
      are, it can merge harmlessly into your body while under the effect of this
      spell. For the duration of this spell, you and the target can separate or
      merge at will as a move action. While merged, your familiar or spirit
      animal can't be targeted or affected by most attacks and effects, though
      it still suffers from ongoing effects and their durations continue. It can
      be the recipient of effects that originate from you.</p>
