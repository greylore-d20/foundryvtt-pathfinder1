  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than
      48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again.
      The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this
      spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is
      permanently <i>raise</i>d from the dead (such as with <i>raise</i> dead).
      The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose
      of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric can cast <i>raise</i>
      dead or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active.
      Once a creature has been revived with <i>temporary resurrection</i>, this
      spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently <i>raise</i>d
      from the dead.</p>
