  shortDescription: >-
    <p>An immobile curtain of illumination springs into existence. When created,
    one side of the wall (designated by you) radiates bright light to a range of
    60 feet away from that side while the other side radiates darkness to an
    equal distance. This effect alters the illumination level by up to two steps
    toward either bright light (the light side) or darkness (the dark side). The
    wall also obstructs vision through it, regardless of which side of the wall
    the viewer is on.</p>
