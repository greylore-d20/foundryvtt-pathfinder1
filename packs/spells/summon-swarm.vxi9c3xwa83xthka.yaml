    value: >-
      <p>You summon a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders (your choice), which
      attacks all other creatures within its area. (You may summon the swarm so
      that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures are
      within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best
      it can. The caster has no control over its target or direction of
      travel.</p>
