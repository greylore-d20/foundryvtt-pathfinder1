  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You express your wrath through sweeps of a wicked tail. You can grow a
      scaly tail. This tail can be used only to make attacks of opportunity, but
      it allows you to make one additional attack of opportunity each round.
      This tail attack deals an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 (1d6
      if you are Small) + your Strength modifier.</p><p>At 10th level, you can
      attempt a free trip combat maneuver check against any creature damaged by
      your tail attack. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
