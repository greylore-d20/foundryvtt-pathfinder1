      <p>You focus your aura on one ally, allowing it to reroll a failed saving
      throw against a charm or fear effect with a +4 sacred bonus. If you do not
      have the aura of courage class ability, this spell has no effect on the
      target's fear. If you do not have the aura of resolve class ability, this
      spell has no effect on any charm effects on the target.</p>
