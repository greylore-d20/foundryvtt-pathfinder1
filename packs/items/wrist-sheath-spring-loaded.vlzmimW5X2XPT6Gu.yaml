      Gear</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This item works like a standard wrist
      sheath, but releasing an item from it is a swift action. Preparing the
      sheath for this use requires cranking the sheathâ€™s tiny gears and springs
      into place (a full-round action that provokes an attack of
      opportunity).</p>
