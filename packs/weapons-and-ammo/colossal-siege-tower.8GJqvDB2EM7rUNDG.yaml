      wooden gallery of stout construction, a siege tower consists of a tall
      protective shell with a roof section. The lower story of the tower
      contains the crew members who propel the tower, and provides total cover
      to those within. A siege tower with the broken condition moves at half
      speed. If a siege tower is destroyed, the entire tower collapses. Treat
      this as a <em>cave-in</em>.</p><p>The upper section of a siege tower
      provides improved cover for a number of soldiers (see below) and may have
      pierced walls allowing creatures to fire ranged weapons out the sides. The
      roof section may have a battlement and may mount a siege engine of the
      siege tower's size or smaller and a corvus. Siege towers have a base speed
      of 15 (or 10 feet if protected with medium or heavy armor).</p><p>Siege
      towers have a hardness of 5, and hit points based on their size. A Large
      siege tower has 60 hit points, a Huge one has 240 hit points, a Gargantuan
      one has 640 hit points, and a Colossal one has 1,250 hit
      points.</p><p></p><h3>Table 3-17: Siege Tower
