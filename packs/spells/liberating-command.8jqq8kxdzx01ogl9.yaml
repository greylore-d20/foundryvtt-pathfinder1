      <p>If the target is bound, grappled, or otherwise restrained, he may make
      an Escape Artist check to escape as an immediate action. He gains a
      competence bonus on this check equal to twice your caster level (maximum
      +20). This spell has no effect if the target could not get free by using
      the Escape Artist skill (for example, if he were under the effects of a
      <i>hold person</i> spell or paralyzed by Strength damage).</p>
