      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.d6lfhyonb3ewpjt4]{secret chest}, except
      it affects a small structure, vault, or oversized chest. Living creatures
      within a <em>secret vault</em> don't cause the spell to fail. While the
      vault is stored on the Ethereal Plane, living creatures within the vault
      don't need to eat, drink, or breathe, but they can't leave the vault
      except via magic such as <em>plane shift</em>. The vault used as a focus
      for <em>secret vault</em> must cost at least 25,000 gp, and its replica
      costs 250 gp. A <em>secret vault</em> has only a 1% cumulative chance per
      day of becoming irretrievably lost after 360 days.</p>
