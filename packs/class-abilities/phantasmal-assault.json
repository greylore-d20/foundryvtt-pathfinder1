      "value": "<p>At 13th level, you learn to harness your psychic force against all forms of haunts and undead creatures. Your mind-affecting spells that deal damage can now be used against haunts and undead normally immune to mind-affecting effects (including mindless undead). These spells are treated as though they dealt positive energy damage. This affects only spells that deal purely psychic-based damage (such as&nbsp;psychic crush,&nbsp;mind thrust, or&nbsp;synapse overload); effects based on physical effects (such as&nbsp;telekinetic projectile&nbsp;or&nbsp;telekinetic storm) don’t benefit from this ability. Additional non-damaging effects from such spells don’t affect the haunt, unless it would be normally affected.</p>\n<p>When you use a mind-affecting effect that deals damage against a possessed creature, the possessing entity takes a –4 penalty on the saving throw against the mind-affecting attack.</p>"
