      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><strong>Slot</strong>
      none</p><p><strong>Capacity</strong> 200; <strong>Usage</strong> 20
      charges</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A clonepod looks like a human-sized
      capsule with a blue window at head height and a bank of touchsensitive
      screens and buttons at chest height. A small slot situated below the
      window can accept genetic material (fingernails, hair clippings, skin
      samples, and so forth). When genetic material is placed in the slot, the
      clonepod immediately atomizes the sample and processes the genetic
      information. At this point, activating the clonepod causes its interior to
      flood with blue biotic fluid, which is then supersaturated with a
      combination of proteins, nanites, and other materials. Over the course of
      the next 12 hours, the clonepod works nonstop to produce an exact replica
      of the creature from which the genetic material was harvested, as the
      creature was when the sample was taken. A clonepod can only duplicate a
      Medium or smaller creature-attempts to clone a larger creature result in a
      hideous, partially formed monstrosity that heaves and gasps a few times
      before dying.</p><p>The completed clone can remain in stasis inside the
      pod indefinitely as long as the seals are not broken. The clone created is
      alive, yet has no mind until a neurocam (see page 50) is used to upload a
      mind into the clone's brain. A clone has the same Strength, Dexterity, and
      Constitution scores of the original body. A clone that is awoken before
      any mind is uploaded into it has no Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and
      Charisma scores are both 1.</p><p>Uploading a mind from a neurocam into a
      clone takes 10 minutes. If the mind belonged to the same creature that was
      used to grow the clone, it immediately comes back to life as if under the
      effects of a <em>clone</em> spell (including 2 negative levels or 2 points
      of Constitution drain)-provided the user's soul has not yet passed to the
      Boneyard and been judged. It possesses the same Intelligence, Wisdom, and
      Charisma of the original mind, all of that creature's skills, and most of
      the memories and personality of the creature (though there may be gaps or
      differences). A mind uploaded into a clone after its soul has been judged
      results in a soulless approximation of the original. Such a creature has
      its Charisma permanently reduced by 2 points (which cannot be restored),
      and has no ability to grow more powerful or gain levels (similar to a
      <em>simulacrum</em>).</p><p>If the clone's body and mind are not from the
      same source, all six ability scores are permanently reduced by 2
      points.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 25;
