  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell enables the subjects to stand watch or keep vigil throughout
    the night without any ill effects. The subjects suffer no fatigue and gain
    all the usual benefits of a full night's rest. The subjects gain hit points
    as though from resting, wizards may prepare their spells as though they had
    slept for 8 hours, and so on. Effects that rely on actual <i>sleep</i> or
    dreaming are ineffective, though the subjects are still susceptible to
    effects that would put them to <i>sleep</i>, such as <i>sleep</i> or <i>deep
    slumber</i>. Any vigorous activity, including fighting, immediately ends the
    effect, and the affected creatures must either have the spell cast on them
    again or <i>sleep</i> for the remaining hours to avoid fatigue and gain the
    benefits of a full night's rest.</p>
