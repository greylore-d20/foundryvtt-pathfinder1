      "value": "<p>You can create a quasi-real simple or martial masterwork weapon appropriate for your current size. You are considered proficient with this weapon. The first time you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature can attempt a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, while success means the creature takes only 1 point of damage from the weapon’s attacks. The weapon deals only 1 point of damage to objects.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, and again at 11th level and 19th level, the weapon gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, the weapon gains either the&nbsp;frost&nbsp;or&nbsp;keen&nbsp;weapon special ability, chosen when the weapon is created. These abilities don’t function against a target that succeeds at its Will save.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, the weapon deals minimum damage (as if it had rolled a 1 on each of its damage dice) against targets that succeed at their saves instead of 1 point of damage.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp.</p>"
