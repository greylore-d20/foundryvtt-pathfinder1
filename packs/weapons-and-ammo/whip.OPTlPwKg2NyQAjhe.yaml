  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or
      higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a
      melee weapon with a 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into
      which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with
      reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including
      adjacent foes).</p><p>Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just
      as if you had used a ranged weapon.</p><p>You can use the Weapon Finesse
      feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to
      attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn't a light
      weapon. You can't wield a whip in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times
      your Strength modifier to damage rolls.</p>
