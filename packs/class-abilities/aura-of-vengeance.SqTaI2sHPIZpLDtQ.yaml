    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, an antipaladin can expend two uses of his smite good
      ability to grant the ability to smite good to all allies within 10 feet,
      using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite good ability by the start of
      the antipaladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this
      ability is a free action. Good creatures gain no benefit from this
      ability.</p>
