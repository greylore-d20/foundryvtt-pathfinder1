      <p>This spell functions as <i>magic circle against chaos</i>, <i>evil</i>,
      <i>good</i>, or <i>law</i>, but rather than stipulating an alignment
      descriptor, you can designate any one non-alignment subtype of outsider,
      including air, earth, fire, and water, as well as outsider races such as
