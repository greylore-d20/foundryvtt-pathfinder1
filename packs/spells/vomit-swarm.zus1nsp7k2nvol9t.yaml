  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You vomit forth a swarm of spiders (<i>Bestiary</i>, page 258) that
    attacks all other creatures within its area. The swarm begins adjacent to
    you, but if no living creatures are within its area, it moves in one
    direction of your choosing at its normal speed.</p><p>You can move the swarm
    or change the swarm's direction by spending a standard action to concentrate
    on the swarm, otherwise it continues moving in its current direction. If
    your caster level is at least 7th, you can vomit forth a swarm of wasps
    instead (<i>Bestiary</i> 275). Finally, if your caster level is at least
    13th, you can vomit forth a swarm of army ants (<i>Bestiary</i> 16).</p>
