      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can impart a shared vision of unfathomable ineffability to a living creature you touch as a standard action, after which your turn immediately ends. You are dazed and the target confused for 1 round by what you both learn. On the following round, you are both staggered for 1 round by the ramifications of your discovery. On the third round, you are confused and the target dazed for 1 round as you attempt to regain your bearings. Each round, the target can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier to negate that round’s effects for both of you, though the effect does not end until the end of the third round. This is a mindaffecting effect that you can use a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Aura of Madness power of the Madness Domain.</p>"
