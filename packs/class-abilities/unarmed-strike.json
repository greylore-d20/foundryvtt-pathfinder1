      "value": "<p>At 1st level, a monk gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed Strike}  as a bonus feat. A monk’s attacks may be with fist, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply his full <em>Strength</em> bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.</p>\n<p>Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal <em>nonlethal damage</em> instead with no penalty on his <em>attack roll</em>. He has the same choice to deal lethal or <em>nonlethal damage</em> while <em>grappling</em>.</p>\n<p>A monk’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or <em>natural weapons</em>.</p>\n<p>A monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown above on Table: Monk. The unarmed damage values listed on <em>Table: Monk</em> are for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with his unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.</p>\n<hr><table><caption><b>Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage</b></caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Damage (Small monk)</th>\n<th>Damage (Large monk)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st–3rd</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th–7th</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th–11th</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th–15th</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th–19th</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>3d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n<td>4d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
