      advanced pieces of technology found in Numeria. It uses a focused beam of
      gravitons to create a bolt of force. A gravity pistol has two
      settings-switching between settings is a swift action. On its pulse
      setting, it can be used as a typical beam weapon, but on it sustained
      setting, holding the pistol's trigger down creates a stable beam of
      gravitons rather than a short, destructive burst. In this mode, the
      gravity pistol can be used to move and manipulate objects at a distance,
      similar to a <em>telekinesis</em> spell in its sustained force or combat
      maneuver versions (a gravity pistol cannot duplicate the violent thrust
      option of a <em>telekinesis</em> spell). In this mode, a gravity pistol
      consumes 1 charge per round. The graviton beam can move objects weighing
      no more than 225 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate
      this effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 19 Reflex
      save. If used to perform a combat maneuver, the beam uses the wielder's
      CMB, but uses her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength or
      Dexterity modifier.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC
