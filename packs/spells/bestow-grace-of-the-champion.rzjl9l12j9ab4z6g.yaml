  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You channel the power of good and law into the target, temporarily giving
    it powers similar to those of a paladin.</p><p>The target gains the ability
    to use <i>detect evil</i> at will as a spell-like ability, immunity to
    disease (suppressing any diseases currently affecting it), and immunity to
    fear (ending any fear effects currently affecting it); can lay on hands (on
    itself only) once as a paladin of 1/2 your caster level; and can smite evil
    once as a paladin of 1/2 your caster level. It adds its Charisma bonus to
    all its saving throws. It can use spell completion, spell trigger, or other
    magic items that require the ability to cast spells as a paladin. Any
    abilities not used by the time the spell expires are lost. This spell has no
    if cast on a paladin.</p>
