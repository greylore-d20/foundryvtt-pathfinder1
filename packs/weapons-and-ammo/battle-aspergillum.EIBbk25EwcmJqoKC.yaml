  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Named for the common aspergillum, a macelike tool used by priests to
      sprinkle holy water, this light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug
      closing off the hole through which the head is filled. When the mace
      strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout
      the weapon's head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1
      point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the
      mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an
      incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no
      damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be
      refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes
      attacks of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is
      normally carried upright, to prevent the holy water from leaking out as
      the weapon moves.</p>
