    value: >-
      <p>You send wracking pains through the targets' bodies. Because of the
      pain, affected creatures take a -2 penalty to AC, attacks, melee damage
      rolls, and Reflex saving throws, and must succeed at a concentration check
      (DC equal to the DC of this spell) to cast spells. However, if an affected
      creature spends a move action screaming as loudly as possible, it can act
      without any other penalties for the remainder of its turn. "Screaming,"
      for the purposes of this spell, includes any vocalization of pain or its
      telepathic equivalent; creatures that cannot scream (such as creatures
      without the natural ability to communicate or vocalize) suffer the full
      effect of the spell.</p>
