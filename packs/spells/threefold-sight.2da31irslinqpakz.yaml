  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You view several possible futures at once, allowing you to thread a
      needle around disasters by taking a middle path. For the duration of this
      spell, whenever you roll for an attack, saving throw, or skill check, roll
      three d20 and use the middle of the three rolls (or the highest, if more
      than one die shows the same highest value, or the lowest, if more than one
      die shows the same lowest value). If another ability would make you roll
      an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check twice and take the higher
      result, roll twice and take the lower result, or reroll, that ability has
      no effect and <i>threefold sight</i> ends immediately.</p>
