      Reflex negates</p>

      <p>You send an elemental mass, energy ball, or object into a particular
      square within 30 feet, dealing 1/4 the normal amount of damage (or half
      the normal amount of damage, for an energy blast) to all creatures in that
      square. The mobile blast lasts until you dismiss it as a free action, lose
      consciousness, or move farther than 30 feet from it. Each round on your
      turn as a move action, you can move the mobile blast to another square
      within range; either way, it continues to deal damage to all creatures in
      its final square each round if they fail their saving throws.</p>

      <p>You can have only a single mobile blast in existence at a time. If the
      mobile blast’s total burn cost before applying any reduction for gather
      power is 0, it has no maximum duration. Otherwise, it lasts for a maximum
      number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier, and afterward you
      can’t create another mobile blast for a number of minutes equal to the
      number of rounds it existed. A mobile blast is always extremely loud and
      visible. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p>
