  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any type of
      Large naga (including most nagas, but not royal nagas), though not the
      form of a specific individual. In effect, you transform into a Large
      serpent, gaining a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a -2 penalty to your
      Dexterity, and a +4 natural armor bonus. Unlike with <i>beast shape
      II</i>, however, you keep your own head when using this spell and can cast
      spells with verbal and somatic components, even though the naga form
      doesn't have hands.  If the form you assume has any of the following
      abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good
      maneuverability), swim 60 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, and
      scent.</p>
