  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects
      that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, he makes a
      <em>Perform</em> (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any
      creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is
      affected by an <em>illusion</em> (<em>pattern</em>) or <em>illusion</em>
      (<em>figment</em>) magical attack may use the bard’s <em>Perform</em>
      check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is
      rolled, the <em>Perform</em> check result proves to be higher. If a
      creature within range of the Distraction is already under the effect of a
      non-instantaneous <em>illusion</em> (<em>pattern</em>) or
      <em>illusion</em> (<em>figment</em>) magical attack, it gains another
      saving throw against the effect each round it sees the Distraction, but it
      must use the bard’s <em>Perform</em> check result for the save.
      Distraction does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Distraction
      relies on visual components.</p>
