      <p>You curse the target with the weaknesses of your kind of vampirism. The
      creature reacts to garlic, mirrors, ringing bells, sunlight, and so on as
      if it were a vampire of the same type as you. This cannot kill the target;
      anything that would kill it (such as a lengthy exposure to sunlight if you
      are a moroi vampire) renders it helpless until the curse or the harmful
      effect is removed. The target gains none of the benefits of being a
      vampire (such as fast healing or requiring special ways to be permanently
      killed), only the penalties.</p>
