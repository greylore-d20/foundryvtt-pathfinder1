      <h3>Description</h3><p>This ammunition is specifically crafted from
      silver, and though nonmagical, it is particularly detrimental to
      lycanthropes, automatically confirming any critical threats against such
      creatures. A firearm that is shooting a silver bullet takes a -1 penalty
      on damage rolls (with a minimum of 1 point of damage).</p>
