      <p><b>Element</b> water; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 1;
      <b>Burn</b> 0</p>

      <p>You can create water as the cantrip
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.snj78r5rw96btfjn]{Create Water}, purify water as if
      using @Compendium[pf1.spells.xi1uouy7qlpfaqlr]{Purify Food and Drink}, and
      dry wet creatures and objects as if using
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.a6isom7wx0nmhwfp]{Prestidigitation}. While you
      cannot lift water into the air using this ability, you can create mild
      currents in a body of water by concentrating. These currents are strong
      enough to run a water mill as if the mill were being turned manually by a
      creature with a Strength score equal to your Constitution score.</p>
