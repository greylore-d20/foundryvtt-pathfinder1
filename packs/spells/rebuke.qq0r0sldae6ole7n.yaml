      <p>Your wrathful words cause physical harm to your enemies.</p><p>Your
      enemies take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) and
      are staggered for 1 round. Half of this damage is sonic damage, but the
      other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject
      to being reduced by resistance to sonic-based attacks. is especially
      devastating to foes who worship your god, inflicting 1d6 points of damage
      per caster level (maximum 10d6) and stunning them for 1d4 rounds. A
      successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the staggering or
      stunning effect.</p><p>Enemies do not need to hear a <i>rebuke</i> to be
      harmed by it, but it is negated by magical silence.</p>
