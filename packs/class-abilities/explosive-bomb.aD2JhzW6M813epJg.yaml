  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5
      feet. Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire,
      taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is
      extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that
      requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a
      +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water
      automatically extinguishes the flames.</p>
