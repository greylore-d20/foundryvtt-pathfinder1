            <p>A holy symbol focuses positive energy and is used by good clerics
            and paladins (or by neutral clerics who want to cast good spells or
            channel positive energy). Each religion has its own holy symbol. The
            material used to make the holy symbol has no effect on its powers,
            though a religion may place special significance on a particular
            material.</p><p>Unholy Symbols: An unholy symbol is like a holy
            symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil
            clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or
            channel negative energy).</p>

      name: Automatic writing planchette
      system:
        description:
          value: >-
            <p>This finely crafted, heart-shaped wooden board has two delicate
            wheels and a small aperture to hold a pencil, which acts as the
            board’s third leg. Typically used on a tabletop covered in butcher’s
            paper, the device scribbles out mysterious messages when employed by
            a creature using the automatic writing occult skill unlock, and
            provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the Linguistics check. When used
            to channel certain haunts capable of communication (see page 230),
            the planchette doubles the rate of communication with the haunt, and
            grants the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks to
            decipher the cryptic messages. These benefits do not stack with
            those of other items that confer similar benefits (such as a talking
            board).</p>

            level in a 5-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light and
            dim light becomes normal light). A candle cannot increase the light
            level above normal light. A candle burns for 1 hour.</p>

            <p>This saucerlike object has a flat bottom, a handle, and a spike
            on top. You can affix a
            @UUID[Compendium.pf1.items.Item.jewqhqesccxrvivd]{candle} onto the
            spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the candlestick by the
            handle. The flat bottom means you’re able to set it down and not
            worry about the candle falling over and extinguishing itself. A
            typical candlestick is crafted from baked clay or a cheap metal such
            as copper, but elaborate and expensive ones exist.</p>

            the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except
            for components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and
            focuses that wouldn’t fit in a pouch. Most spell component pouches
            are waterproof and can be strung onto a belt or bandolier.</p>
