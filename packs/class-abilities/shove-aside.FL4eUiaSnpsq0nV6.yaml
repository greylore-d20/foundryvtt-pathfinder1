    value: >-
      <p>When you and an adjacent ally are both in the area of an attack that
      requires a saving throw, you can take a â€“4 penalty on your saving throw to
      grant your ally a +4 bonus on his saving throw. You lose the evasion
      ability against this attack. If you have improved evasion, it is reduced
      to evasion for this attack instead. A rogue must have evasion to select
      this rogue talent.</p>
