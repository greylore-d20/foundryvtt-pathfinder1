      "value": "<p>You are reclusive and paranoid to the point that your allies cannot easily help you in times of stress or unease. Whenever you are in combat, your allies must succeed at a melee touch attack to affect you with touch spells, and you must attempt saving throws to resist all spells cast by anyone other than yourself, even those cast by allies. Instantaneous spells you cast only on yourself affect you as though your caster level were 1 higher.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, any spells you cast only on yourself affect you as if they were modified by the @Compendium[pf1.feats.btXWioB3SKJv8YEG]{Extend Spell} feat. This does not increase their level or casting time.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you are immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you gain spell resistance equal to 10 + your oracle level.</p>"
