    value: >-
      <p>You send an empathic urge to seek safety both as fast as possible and
      in an orderly fashion, and to remain in such secure locations for the
      duration of the spell. <b>Targets</b> with 5 or more Hit Dice are
      unaffected. When you cast the spell, you can designate a fortified
      location-either general (such as "indoors") or specific (such as "the
      local garrison")-for the targets to attempt to reach. If you do not
      specify a location for the targets to retreat to, they attempt to find
      safety to the best of their ability. Affected creatures defend themselves
      normally but attack only if provoked.</p>
