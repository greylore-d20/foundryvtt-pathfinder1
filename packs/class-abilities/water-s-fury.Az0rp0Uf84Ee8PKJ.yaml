  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to summon a rushing jet of water
      from the elemental plane of water and direct it against your foes. As a
      <em>standard action</em>, you can create a jet of water in a 60-foot line
      that deals 1d6 points of damage per two sorcerer levels you possess, and
      blinds the target that was struck for 1d6 rounds. A <em>Reflex</em> save
      (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your <em>Charisma</em> bonus) reduces
      the damage by half and negates the blinding effect.</p>
