Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a <em>full-round action</em> to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 <em>Reflex</em> save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.</p>\n<p><em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC: 20</p>\n<p>Alchemical Power Component</p>\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO9410</em></p>\n<p>This dwarven favorite can make fire spells last longer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Burning Hands</em> (M): One target that fails its <em>Reflex</em> saving throw (your choice) catches on fire as if it has been struck by <em>alchemist's</em> fire.</li>\n<li><em>Fireball</em> (M): One target per <em>caster level</em> that fails its <em>Reflex</em> saving throw (your choice) catches on fire as if it has been struck by <em>alchemist's</em> fire.</li>\n<li><em>Flaming Sphere</em> (M): Any creature damaged by a <em>flaming sphere</em> catches on fire as if it has been struck by <em>alchemist's</em> fire.</li>\n<li><em>Protection from Energy</em> (M): If cast to ward against cold, increase the amount of cold damage absorbed by 5.</li>\n<li><em>Resist Energy</em> (M): If cast to ward against cold, increase the cold <em>resistance</em> to 12.
