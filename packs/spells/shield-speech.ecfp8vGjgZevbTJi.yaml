      <p>You can securely communicate with one creature within range. So long as
      your target remains within 10 feet of you, you and it can speak freely to
      each other without fear of being overheard. Communications that involve
      shield speech cannot be spied on, such as with a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.pwueht12qqo0268e]{divination} spell, and observers
      of the conversation can tell you are communicating but cannot read lips or
      hear the conversation unless they are the target of the spell. If you or
      the target speak to any other creatures, they can hear you normally (only
      communication between you and the target is protected). The spell does not
      shield writing, sign language, or any form of communication other than
      speaking.</p>
