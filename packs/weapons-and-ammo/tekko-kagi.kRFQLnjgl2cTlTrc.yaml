    value: >-
      <p>Also known as an iron claw, this device consists of a fanlike structure
      of three or more 10-inch blades secured to a sturdy handle strapped to the
      forearm of the off hand. It can be used as an offensive weapon or
      defensively like a buckler, or used to disarm an opponent without
      provoking an attack of opportunity. It provides its owner with a +2
      circumstance bonus on attempts to disarm or sunder swords or other
      slender-bladed weapons.</p>
