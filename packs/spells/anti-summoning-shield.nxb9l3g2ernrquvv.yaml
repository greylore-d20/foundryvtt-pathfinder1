      <p>Within the area of effect, this spell impedes the use of spells of the
      summoning subschool and other effects that summon creatures. Any such
      spells, spell-like abilities, or similar summoning effects used within the
      area have a percent chance of failure equals 5% x your caster level, to a
      maximum 75% chance of failure. If the summoning effect already has a
      percent chance of failure (as is often the case with the summon spell-like
      ability of outsiders), these percentages stack. This spell does not affect
      summoners attempting to summon their eidolon, but it does affect summoners
      casting other summoning spells.</p>
