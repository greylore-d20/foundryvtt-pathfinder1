      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This advanced version of the blunderbuss shoots in a 30-foot cone when
      firing pellets, and has a 20-foot range increment when firing a bullet
      (often called a slug). Shotguns can either be simple and functional, or
      art pieces in their own right, with engravings and inlay on the stocks and
      breeches. Those used by the upper class are often emblazoned with images
      of game animals, family crests, or elaborate maker's marks.</p>

      <p>A shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or
      pellets) as ammunition.</p>
