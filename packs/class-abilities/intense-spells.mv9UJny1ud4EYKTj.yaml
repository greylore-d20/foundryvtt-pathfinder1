  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, add
      1/2 your wizard level to the damage (minimum +1). This bonus only applies
      once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split between
      multiple missiles or rays. This bonus damage is not increased by
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.77gXSucrxfrE9yWk]{Empower Spell}</em> or
      similar effects. This damage is of the same type as the spell. At 20th
      level, whenever you cast an evocation spell you can roll twice to
      penetrate a creatureâ€™s spell resistance and take the better result.</p>
