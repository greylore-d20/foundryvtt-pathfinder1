          <p>Short swords are some of the most common weapons found in any
          martial society, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on
          the region and creator. Most are around 2 feet in length. Their blades
          can be curved or straight, single- or double-edged, and wide or
          narrow. Hilts may be ornate or simple, with crossguards, basket hilts,
          or no guard at all. Such weapons are often used on their own, but can
          also be paired as a matched set, or used in conjunction with a dagger
          or longer sword.</p>

    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>Goblins prefer to dwell in caves, amid large and dense thickets of
        thistles and brambles, or in structures built and then abandoned by
        others. Very few goblins have the drive to build structures of their
        own. Coastlines are favored, as goblins are quite fond of sifting
        through junk and flotsam in an unending quest to find treasures among
        the refuse of more civilized races.</p><p>Goblin hatred runs deep, and
        few things inspire their wrath more than gnomes (who have long fought
        against goblins), horses (who frighten goblins tremendously), and
        regular dogs (whom goblins regard as pale imitations of goblin
        dogs).</p><p>Goblins are also quite superstitious, and treat magic with
        a fawning mixture of awe and fear. They have the habit of ascribing
        magic to the mundane as well, with fire and writing both taking on
        mystical power in goblin society. Fire is much loved by goblins for its
        capacity to wreak great destruction and because it doesn’t require size
        or strength to wield, but written words are hated. Goblins believe that
        writing steals words out of your head, and as a result of this belief,
        goblins are universally illiterate.</p><p>Goblins are voracious and can
        eat their body weight in food daily without growing fat. Goblin lairs
        always have numerous storerooms and larders. While they prefer human and
        gnome flesh, a goblin won’t turn down any food—except, perhaps,
        vegetables.</p>
