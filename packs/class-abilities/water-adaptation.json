This can affect a volume of water equal to 2 gallons per kineticist level, allowing sea creatures to survive in water that was fresh and freshwater creatures to survive in water that was briny.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you alter water’s salinity with this talent, you can adjust the water’s temperature so that a creature can survive in it more easily (or simply be more comfortable). Water altered in this way must be confined within an appropriately sized container; attempts to alter a larger quantity of water fail.</p>"
