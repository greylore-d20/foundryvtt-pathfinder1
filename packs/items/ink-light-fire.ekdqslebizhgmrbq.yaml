      <p>This alchemically infused ink ensures secret messages destroy
      themselves after being read. If light strikes the ink after it has dried,
      chemicals cause it to spontaneously combust within about a minute. The
      combustion is small-not significant enough to ignite anything but paper.
      Ink used on other materials such as stone or wood simply vanishes, leaving
      no trace of the writing. A <em>vial</em> of this <em>ink</em> holds enough
      to write 10 brief messages of no more than 50 words each.</p>

      <p>Light fire ink can be created with a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>
