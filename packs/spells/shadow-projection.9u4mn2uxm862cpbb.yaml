  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your
      shadow, giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead
      shadow (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 245). Your physical body lies
      comatose while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow
      or reflection while the spell is in effect.</p><p>While projecting your
      shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision, defensive abilities, fly speed,
      racial stealth modifier, and strength damage attack. You do not gain the
      creature's <i>create spawn</i> ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit
      Dice.</p><p>Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal to your
      own.</p><p>Your <i>shadow projection</i> has the undead type and may be
      turned or affected as undead.</p><p>If your <i>shadow projection</i> is
      slain, you return to your physical body and are immediately reduced to -1
      hit points.</p><p>Your condition becomes dying, and you must begin making
      Constitution checks to stabilize.</p>
