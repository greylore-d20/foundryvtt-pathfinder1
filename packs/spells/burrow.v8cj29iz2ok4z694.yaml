      <p>The subject can <i>burrow</i> at a speed of 15 feet (or 10 feet if it
      wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load)
      through sand, loose soil, or gravel, or at a speed of 5 feet through
      stone. Using <i>burrow</i> requires only as much concentration as walking,
      so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The <i>burrow</i>ing
      creature cannot charge or run. Loose material collapses behind the target
      1 round after it leaves the area. This spell does not give the target the
      ability to breathe underground, so when passing through loose material,
      the creature must hold its breath and take only short trips, or else it
      may suffocate.</p>
