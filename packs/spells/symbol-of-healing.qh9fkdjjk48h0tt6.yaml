      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g0x2fnktg1553wv1]{symbol of death},
      except all creatures within 60 feet of the <em>symbol of healing</em>
      instead are bathed in positive energy and heal 2d8 points + 1 point of
      damage per caster level (maximum +15). Undead and other creatures harmed
      by positive energy instead take 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster
      level (maximum +15); a Will save reduces this damage by half. A creature
      can only be healed or harmed by the symbol once in any 24-hour period.
      Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster
      level.</p><p><em>Symbol of healing</em> can be made permanent with a
      <em>permanency</em> spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost
      of 10,000 gp.</p>
