      <p>This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.wtw123wqg2eej75w]{psychic crush IV}, but
      on a successful Fortitude or Will save, the target takes 11d6 points of
      damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. If it is at fewer than half
      its total hit points, the target takes a -2 penalty on the Will save to
      resist this spell. This spell can be undercast.</p>
