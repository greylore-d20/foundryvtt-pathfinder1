For creatures with PC class levels, this is the same as that of the base creature –1. Creatures with a significant number of spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities have their CR further reduced by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>Type changes to plant. Do not recalculate BAB, hit points, saves, or skill ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Alignment changes to lawful evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A pod-spawned creature gains low-light vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A pod-spawned creature gains plant traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities: </strong>The pod-spawned creature gains the mimic ability.</p>\n<p><em>Mimic (Ex)&nbsp;</em>A pod-spawned creature retains all the knowledge of its original. It can impersonate the original perfectly except for its lack of emotion. This emotionlessness can be detected with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check. A creature familiar with the original gains a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. If the podspawned creature feigns sincere emotion, the Sense Motive check is opposed by its Bluff check instead. Podspawned creatures resemble the original down to hair and blood. Noticing small physical imperfections requires a successful Perception check with a DC determined by the spawning bodythief ’s Disguise check, made when the pod hatches.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Cha –4.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats: </strong>All feats are retained, even if the pod-spawned creature no longer qualifies for their prerequisites.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities: </strong>The creature loses any spellcasting ability and all spell-like and supernatural abilities.</p>"
