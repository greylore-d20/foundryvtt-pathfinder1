Consuming mellowroot causes a euphoric feeling that makes you feel invulnerable. For 1 hour after consuming mellowroot, you gain a +5 <em>alchemical bonus</em> versus fear effects. However, while under the effects of mellowroot, you must make a DC 15 <em>Will</em> saving throw when you try to leave the <em>threatened</em> area of an opponent. If you fail the saving throw, you cannot leave the <em>threatened</em> area with that action but do not lose the action.</p>\r\n"
