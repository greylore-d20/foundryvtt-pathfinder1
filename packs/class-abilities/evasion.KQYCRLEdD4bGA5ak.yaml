  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This character can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If she
      makes a successful <em>Reflex</em> <em>saving throw</em> against an attack
      that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no
      damage. Evasion can be used only if the character is wearing light armor
      or no armor. A <em>helpless</em> character does not gain the benefit of
      <em>evasion</em>.</p>
