    value: >-
      <p>You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each round
      on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the
      labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the
      <i>maze</i> disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject.</p><p>On
      escaping or leaving the <i>maze</i>, the subject reappears where it had
      been when the <i>maze</i> spell was cast. If this location is filled with
      a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open
      space.</p><p>Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane,
      such as <i>teleport</i> and <i>dimension door</i>, do not help a creature
      escape a <i>maze</i> spell, although a <i>plane shift</i> spell allows it
      to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not
      affected by this spell.</p>
