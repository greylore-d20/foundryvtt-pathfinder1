      <p><i>Clairaudience/clairvoyance</i> creates an invisible magical sensor
      at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice)
      almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of
      effect, but the locale must be known--a place familiar to you, or an
      obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move,
      but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired.
      Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or
      supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is
      magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can
      see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect.
      <i>Clairaudience/clairvoyance</i> functions only on the plane of existence
      you are currently occupying.</p>
