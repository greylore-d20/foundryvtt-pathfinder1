      S</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A garrote is a length of wire or thin rope
      with wooden handles at both ends. The wire is placed across a victim's
      throat and crossed behind the neck; when the handles are pulled tight, the
      garrote strangles him. In order for you to use a garrote, your opponent
      must be helpless or unaware of you. You must make a grapple check (though
      you avoid the -4 penalty for not having two hands free) to successfully
      begin garroting your opponent. Sneak attack damage does not apply to a
      garrote. Your garroted opponent must make a concentration check (DC 20 +
      your CMB + level of the spell he's casting) to cast a spell with a verbal
      component, use a command word item, or use any magic requiring speech. You
      gain the following additional option when grappling with a
      garrote.</p><p><em>Choke</em>: You cut off your target's air supply so he
      has to hold his breath (see Suffocation on page 445 of the <em>Pathfinder
      RPG Core Rulebook</em>, and the Swim skill on page 108). Any round you do
      not maintain the choke, your opponent can take a breath and restart when
      he has to begin making Constitution checks.</p>
