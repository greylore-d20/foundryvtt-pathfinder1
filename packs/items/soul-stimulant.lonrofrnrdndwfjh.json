If you have a <em>negative level</em> (whether temporary or permanent), you can drink a dose of soul stimulant, negating the <em>negative level's</em> penalty for 12 hours. You can only benefit from 1 dose of soul stimulant at a time, though you can continue to take a dose every 12 hours to stave off the <em>negative level's</em> effects.</p>"
