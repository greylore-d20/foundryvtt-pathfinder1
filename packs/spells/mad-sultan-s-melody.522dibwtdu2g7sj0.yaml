      <p>You imitate the mad cacophony created by the awful beings associated
      with the Outer God, Azathoth. This spell targets only creatures with the
      ooze type, creatures with the amorphous special ability, and non-bipedal
      creatures with a special association with the Outer Gods. This music draws
      the targets' attention to the caster, as per the fascinate bardic
      performance. It affects mindless creatures despite the mindless quality
      typically granting immunity to mind-affecting effects, though it doesn't
      ignore any other immunity to mind-affecting effects the creature might
      have. The caster doesn't have to maintain the effect each round-the music
      continues for the duration of the spell. Creatures fascinated by mad
      sultan's melody become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24
      hours after the spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks
      on any of its targets for any reason (such as an attack).  If you have the
      bardic performance class feature and the fascinate bardic performance, you
      can choose to use the spell's saving throw DC or a DC equal to 10 + 1/2
      your levels in the class that grants you bardic performance + your
      Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. If you choose to use the latter
      DC, each round of the melody costs 1 round of bardic performance and it
      counts as an active performance for determining how many performances you
      can have active.  This spell takes a toll on the caster. Each time you
      cast it, you take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the
      sanity system (see page 12), you instead take 2d6 points of sanity
      damage.</p>
