      <p><strong>Category</strong> Animal Gear</p><p>These sturdy, weatherproof
      bags are draped over a saddle to add extra carrying capacity. Each side of
      a saddlebag can typically carry 20 pound of items that can fit in the
      bags. Saddlebags do not increase the amount of weight a mount can carry;
      they merely give riders a place to stow their equipment.</p>
