    value: >-
      <p>You gain greater sensitivity to magic associated with your primary
      spirit and your wandering spirits (any spells on the spirit magic spell
      lists for these spirits, as well as spell-like abilities that duplicate
      the effects of those spells). You gain a +10 circumstance bonus on
      Spellcraft checks to identify these spells if they are cast within the
      area, and a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws to resist the effects
      of such spells. If any of these spells require an attack roll, you are
      never considered flat-footed against such attacks.</p>
