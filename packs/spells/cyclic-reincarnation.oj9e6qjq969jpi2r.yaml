      <p>This spell allows a dead creature that died no more than 1 year before
      the casting of the spell to return to life in a body that closely
      resembles its original body; it functions as <i>reincarnate</i> except as
      noted. <i>Cyclic reincarnation</i> returns the dead creature to life in a
      new body of the same race that the target belonged to in life, and the new
      body appears physically similar to the creature's previous one, to the
      extent that the creature could be easily mistaken for its own offspring or
      kin. If the affected creature isn't a humanoid, there is a 75% chance that
      the creature returns to life as a youth of its race, gaining the young
      creature simple template instead (or becomes a juvenile, in the case of
      dragons and other creatures whose power is determined by their age
      category).  You can use <i>cyclic reincarnation</i> on someone who was
      killed by a death effect or turned into an undead creature and then
      destroyed, but nonhumanoids so restored always return to life with the
      young creature simple template (or as a juvenile, in the case of creatures
      whose power is determined by their age category).</p>
