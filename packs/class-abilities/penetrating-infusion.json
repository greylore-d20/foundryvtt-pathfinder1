Treat your foe’s cold, electricity, or fire resistance as if it were 5 lower for the purpose of determining the infused blast’s damage; this doesn’t stack with the reduction from searing flame.</p>\n<p>You can increase the burn cost of this infusion to further reduce the foe’s resistance against the infused blast by 5 per additional point of burn accepted. This has no effect on creatures with immunity.</p>"
