You can instead cast this spell immediately after a failed Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, causing the target of that check to believe that a different creature you designate within spell range was responsible for the content of that failed check. Using the spell in these ways doesn't compel the target to undertake a specific action in response to its belief of where the blame lies.</p>",
