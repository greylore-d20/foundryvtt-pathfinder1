      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>A juju zombie is an animated corpse
      of a creature, created to serve as an undead minion, that retains the
      skills and abilities it possessed in life.<p>“Juju zombie" is an acquired
      template that can be added to any living corporeal creature, referred to
      hereafter as the base creature.<p><b>CR:</b> As base creature +1.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil.</p>

      <p><b>Type:</b> The creature’s type changes to undead. It retains any
      subtype except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind.</p>

      <p><b>Armor Class:</b> A juju zombie gains a +3 bonus to its natural armor
      over the base creature’s natural armor bonus.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all the creature’s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All
      Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, juju
      zombies use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points
      (instead of Constitution).</p>

      <p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Juju zombies gain channel resistance +4, DR
      5/magic and slashing (or DR 10/magic and slashing if it has 11 HD or
      more), and fire resistance 10. They are immune to cold, electricity, and
      magic missile.</p>

      <p><b>Speed:</b> A winged juju zombie’s maneuverability drops to clumsy.
      If the base creature flew magically, its fly speed is unchanged. Retain
      all other movement types.</p>

      <p><b>Attacks:</b> A juju zombie retains all the natural weapons,
      manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base
      creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the juju
      zombie’s size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual
      size.</p>

      <p><b>Abilities:</b> Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4,
      Dex +2. A juju zombie has no Con score; as an undead, it uses its Charisma
      in place of Constitution when calculating hit points, Fortitude saves, or
      any special ability that relies on Constitution.</p>

      <p><b>Feats:</b> A juju zombie gains Improved Initiative and Toughness as
      bonus feats.</p>

      <p><b>Skills:</b> A juju zombie gains a +8 racial bonus on all Climb
      checks.</p>
