    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, the power of pure magic music flows through you. You
      cast any spell with a verbal component as if it had the
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.jVFjMIyQD6TOAsmj]{Still Spell} metamagic feat
      applied to it, with no increase to the <em>casting time</em> or spell slot
      required to cast it. You gain <em>immunity</em> to sonic damage and
      language-dependent spells.</p>
