      <p>These masterwork <em>manacles</em> are designed to swiftly secure a
      restrained creature. The price includes a quick-release mechanism that,
      when attached to a belt or pack, allows you to retrieve the quickcatch
      <em>manacles</em> with one hand as a <em>swift action</em>.</p>

      <p>Quickcatch <em>manacles</em> include a good <em>lock</em> that locks
      automatically when the <em>manacles</em> are applied. When you take the
      tie up action in a <em>grapple</em>, you can <em>lock</em> your opponent
      in quickcatch <em>manacles</em> instead of using <em>rope</em>. The
      quickcatch <em>manacles</em> must be sized appropriately for your
      opponent. Quickcatch <em>manacles</em> can be constructed for creatures of
      different sizes using the same multipliers as ordinary
      <em>manacles</em>.</p>
