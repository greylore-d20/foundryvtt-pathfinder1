      <p>You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object
      bearing written information. The <i>explosive runes</i> detonate when
      read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the <i>explosive
      runes</i> (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving
      throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the <i>explosive runes</i> is
      entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the
      <i>explosive runes</i> were written also takes full damage (no saving
      throw). You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the
      protected writing without triggering the <i>explosive runes</i>. Likewise,
      you can remove the <i>explosive runes</i> whenever desired. Another
      creature can remove them with a successful <i>dispel magic</i> or
      <i>erase</i> spell, but attempting to dispel or <i>erase</i> the
      <i>explosive runes</i> and failing to do so triggers the explosion. Magic
      traps such as <i>explosive runes</i> are hard to detect and disable. A
      character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device
      to thwart <i>explosive runes</i>. The DC to find magic traps using
      Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>explosive
      runes</i>.</p>
