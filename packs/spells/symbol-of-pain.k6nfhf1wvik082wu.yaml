      <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that each
      creature within the radius of a <i>symbol of pain</i> instead suffers
      wracking <i>pain</i>s that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill
      checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the
      creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.</p><p>Unlike
      <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>symbol of pain</i> has no hit point limit; once
      triggered, a <i><i>symbol of pain</i></i> simply remains active for 10
      minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol
      of pain</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the
      Perception skill to find a <i>symbol of pain</i> and Disable Device to
      thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for <i>symbol of
      pain</i>.</p>
