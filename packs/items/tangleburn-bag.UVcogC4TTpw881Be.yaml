  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This sack contains tanglefoot bag materials and alchemical powders that
      burn at a high temperature. It functions like a tanglefoot bag, plus a
      direct hit on a creature deals 1d6 points of fire damage, and the creature
      must make a DC 20 Reflex save or catch on fire. If it catches on fire, for
      the next 2 rounds extinguishing the flames is a DC 25 Reflex save instead
      of a DC 15 save, and using water to extinguish the flames creates a burst
      of burning material equivalent to alchemistâ€™s fire making a direct hit on
      the target (including splash damage). After the initial 2 rounds, the
      flames may be extinguished as normal. Crafting this item is a DC 30 Craft
      (alchemy) check.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p>Craft (Alchemy) DC 30</p>
