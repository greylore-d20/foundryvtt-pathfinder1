      "value": "<p>Once per day while under the effects of his mutagen, the alchemist can split into two identical copies of himself as an immediate action after being damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon. Each copy has an ooze-like complexion, most often manifesting as a slimy sheen to his skin. The alchemist splits his current hit points evenly between the copies. The copies use the same statistics, share the same resources, and have identical equipment (except artifacts, which only one copy has). Similarly, if one of the copies expends a charge or daily use from a magic item that a copy has, the charge or daily use is expended from both copies. If one copy drops or gives away an item, the duplicate item disappears from the other copy as well.<br><br>The two copies act independently and each one has a full set of actions. At the end of the alchemist’s next turn, he selects one of the copies, which loses its ooze-like complexion as it becomes the alchemist; the other copy dissolves into a fine mist and dissipates. If one of the copies is destroyed before this happens, the remaining copy immediately becomes the alchemist, and he gains 1 permanent negative level. If both copies are destroyed simultaneously (such as from a @Compendium[pf1.spells.6oq1wcryviik9ice]{Fireball}), both copies collapse into formless goo; the alchemist can only be restored to life via @Compendium[pf1.spells.thh46ghi51lrl3cl]{Resurrection}&nbsp;or similarly powerful magic.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 12th level before he can select this discovery.</p>"
