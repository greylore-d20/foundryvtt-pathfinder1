  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target of this spell grows the fangs of a vampire, as well as a
    thirst for blood. For the duration of this spell, the target gains the
    ability to drain an opponent's blood during a grapple; if the target
    establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
    Constitution damage. Each round it drains blood in this way, the target
    heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for the duration of the
    spell (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full
    normal hit points). If the target does not drain blood in this way while
    under the effects of this spell, it becomes exhausted at the end of the
    spell's duration.</p>
