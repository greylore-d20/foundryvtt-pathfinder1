  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whispering in the dense, information-rich machine language of the First
      Ones, you bring a destroyed construct back to operational status for a
      short time, restoring it to 1 hit point. The construct can be further
      healed with spells like <i>make whole</i>, but it returns to its destroyed
      state as soon as this spell's duration expires or it is brought to 0 hit
      points, whichever comes first. As long as the construct is active, it
      obeys your commands to the best of its ability, fighting on your behalf
      and carrying out tasks that it is capable of performing.</p><p>Constructs
      with more than twice as many Hit Dice as your caster level cannot be
      targeted by this spell.</p>
