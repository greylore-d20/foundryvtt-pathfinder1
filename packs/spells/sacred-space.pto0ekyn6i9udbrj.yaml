  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell sanctifies an area with heavenly power. The DC to resist
      spells or spell-like abilities with the good descriptor or channeled
      energy that damages evil outsiders (as when using Alignment Channel)
      increases by +2. In addition, evil outsiders take a -1 penalty on attack
      rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and they cannot be called or
      summoned into a <i>sacred space</i>. If the <i>sacred space</i> contains
      an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity,
      pantheon, or good-aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are
      doubled. You cannot cast <i>sacred space</i> in an area with a permanent
      fixture dedicated to a deity other than yours.</p>
