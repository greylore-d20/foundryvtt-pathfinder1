      <p>As @Compendium[pf1.spells.25bv1s6jwr8imm1o]{Insect Spies}, but you can
      also borrow the senses of the summoned insects. As a move action, you can
      choose to receive sensory input from one of the insects, seeing what it
      sees and hearing what it hears. While doing so, you are treated as being
      blind and deaf. You can change to another insect, or return to your own
      senses, with another move action.</p>
