      <p><i>Summon laborers</i> summons one humanoid petitioner per caster
      level. These petitioners hail from one plane of your choice and perform
      tasks at your direction. The petitioners cannot fight or travel to
      dangerous lands, but do assist your downtime activities (<i>Pathfinder RPG
      Ultimate Campaign</i> 8 4) w ithin a s ettlement, increasing the effect of
      Influence or Labor you spend by 50%, to  a maximum of 1 additional point
      of Influence or Labor for every 2 caster levels you possess. This stacks
      with any increase to the effect of Influence or Labor that you receive
      from your followers within the settlement where the downtime activity
      takes place (if any). <i>Summon laborers</i> is a spell of the same
      alignment type as the plane from which the summoned petitioners hail
      (chaotic and evil for the Abyss, lawful and good for Heaven, and so on).
      Effects that increase the number of creatures summoned by a spell (such as
      Superior SummoningUM) do not affect <i>summon laborers</i>.</p>
