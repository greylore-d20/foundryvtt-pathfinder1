      "value": "<p>You can attempt a Charisma check to entice a target that could be sexually attracted to you into letting you speak for up to 1 minute when it would otherwise be unwilling to consider your words. The DC of this Charisma check is equal to 10 + the targetâ€™s Wisdom modifier. If successfully used in combat, this ability instead functions as a successful feint and the target cannot take any actions that would attack you as long as it is denied its Dexterity bonus against you.</p>"
