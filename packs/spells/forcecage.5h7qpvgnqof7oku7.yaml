      <p>This spell creates an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of
      either bars of force or solid walls of force (your
      choice).</p><p>Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless
      they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically
      fails.</p><p>Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a
      means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal
      Plane, blocking ethereal travel.</p><p>Like a <i>Wall of Force</i>, a
      <i>forcecage</i> resists <i>dispel magic,</i> although a mage's
      disjunction still functions. The walls of a <i>forcecage</i> can be
      damaged by spells as normal, except for <i>disintegrate,</i> which
      automatically destroys it. The walls of a <i>forcecage</i> can be damaged
      by weapons and supernatural abilities, but they have a Hardness of 30 and
      a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a
      <i>sphere of annihilation</i> or <i>rod of cancellation</i> instantly
      destroys a <i>forcecage</i>.</p><p>Barred Cage: This version of the spell
      produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a <i>Wall of
      Force</i> spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch
      gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small
      space can escape; others are confined within the barred cage. You can't
      attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit
      between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar
      ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and
      breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.</p><p><i>Windowless
      Cell</i>: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in
      and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.</p>
