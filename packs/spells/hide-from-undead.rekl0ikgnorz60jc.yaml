      <p>Undead cannot see, hear, or smell creatures warded by this
      spell.</p><p>Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such
      as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate
      warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures (such as skeletons or
      zombies) are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures
      are not there. An intelligent undead creature gets a single Will saving
      throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of the warded creatures. If
      it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, however, it can
      attempt to find or strike them. If a warded creature attempts to channel
      positive energy, turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or
      attacks any creature (even with a spell), the spell ends for all
      recipients.</p>
