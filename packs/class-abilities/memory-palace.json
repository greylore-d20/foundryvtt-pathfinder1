      "value": "<p>At 13th level, you mentally construct an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing the volumes of lore you’ve studied. This ability functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.kqftgm3bi2dqj92l]{Mage's Magnificent Mansion}, with the following adjustments: the memory palace is limited in size to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your psychic level; your memory palace doesn’t contain any furniture other than bookcases and a few desks and sofas where you and your visitors can study; and there is no food within, though the memory palace does contain a number of unseen servants equal to 1/2 your psychic level, which function solely as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you summon it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating. You can reshape the memory palace in your mind, so it doesn’t need to currently be in effect for you to alter it. You can create your memory palace once per day.<br><br>Choose one type of Knowledge skill when you gain this ability. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within—including you—a +4 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks of that type, and the memory palace counts as an extensive library for people attempting Knowledge checks of that type untrained. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on checks with the chosen skill when you’re not consulting the palace (including when the palace isn’t in effect).</p>\n<p>At 14th level and at each additional level thereafter, choose another Knowledge skill to which your memory palace’s library bonuses apply.</p>"
