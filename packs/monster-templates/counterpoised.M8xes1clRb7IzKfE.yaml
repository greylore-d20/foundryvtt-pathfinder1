      Monster<p>Counterpoised creatures dwell in the Outer Planes where balance
      between elements or ideologies is paramount, but they can be summoned
      using spells such as summon monster and planar ally. A counterpoised
      creature’s CR increases by 1 only if the base creature has 5 or more Hit
      Dice. A counterpoised creature’s quick and rebuild rules are the
      same.<p><b>Rebuild Rules:</b> Senses gains darkvision 60 ft.; Defensive
      Abilities gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the table; SR gains
      SR equal to new CR +5; Special Attacks smite bias 1/day as a swift action
      (adds Cha bonus to attack rolls and damage bonus equal to HD against a foe
      that is chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good; smite
      persists until the target is dead or the counterpoised creature
      rests).</p>
