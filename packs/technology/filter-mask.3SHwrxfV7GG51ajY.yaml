      charge/hour</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A filter mask is a clear plastic
      shield worn over the entire face. The mask has ionized filters and
      scrubbers that purify the air the user breathes in and give the mask an
      unintentionally fearsome look. While the mask has power, the wearer is
      completely immune to inhaled toxins or diseases. Even when the mask has no
      power, it grants the wearer a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws
      made to resist airborne toxins and
      diseases.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 24;
