      "value": "<p>Whenever the magus scores a critical hit against an opponent with a melee attack, he can gain preternatural insight into his foeâ€™s strengths and weaknesses as though he had rolled a natural 20 on a Knowledge check to identify the creature struck. Any bonuses or penalties the magus normally applies to such a Knowledge check are applied to this ability, including his Intelligence modifier, ranks in the requisite Knowledge skill, and other applicable modifiers. Depending on the final calculated outcome of this ability and the CR of the creature struck, the magus may still be unable to glean information about his enemy. This ability works even if the magus has already attempted a Knowledge check to identify the creature.</p>"
