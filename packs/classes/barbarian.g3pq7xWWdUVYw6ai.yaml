      <p>For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury
      of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal
      souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques,
      they are not soldiers or professional warriors—they are the battle
      possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians,
      these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of
      warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before
      them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They
      possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all
      that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of
      life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such
      philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms
      the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess
      and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With
      rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors,
      barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in
      their way.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: Any non-lawful</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d12</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>
