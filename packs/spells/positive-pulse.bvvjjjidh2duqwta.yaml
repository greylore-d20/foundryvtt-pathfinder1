  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell causes a wave of positive energy to spread from a point you
    designate, damaging foes vulnerable to positive energy and bolstering living
    creatures. Each creature damaged by positive energy in the area (such as
    undead) must succeed at a Will save or take 1d6 points of damage, plus 1
    point for every 2 caster levels (maximum +5). Haunts manifesting in the
    spell's area also take this damage.  This spell does not heal creatures
    healed by positive energy; such creatures instead gain a +2 bonus on saving
    throws against death effects, energy drain, negative energy, and effects
    directly caused by haunts. This bonus lasts for 1 round.</p>
