      <p>Your mind is able to correlate information effectively. When attempting
      an Appraise, Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft check, you can roll
      twice and take the higher result. If you have an ability that allows you
      to roll twice, you cannot use that ability and this benefit on the same
      roll.</p><p>The spell is discharged once you have used its benefit a
      number of times equal to your caster level.</p>
