      <p>This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant
      creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive
      your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as
      friendly). They will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to
      give a subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to
      convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not
      allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful
      orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth
      doing.</p><p>You can affect a number of plant creatures whose combined
      level or HD do not exceed twice your level.</p>
