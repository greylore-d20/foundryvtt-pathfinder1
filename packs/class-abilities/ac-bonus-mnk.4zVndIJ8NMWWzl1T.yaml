  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if
      any) to his AC and his CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and
      CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels
      thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. </p><p>These bonuses to
      AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He
      loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any
      armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy
      load.</p>
