      <p>At 12th level, once per day when an attack or spell that deals damage
      would result in your death, you can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If you
      succeed, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point; if you succeed and
      already have less than 1 hit point, you instead take no damage.</p>
