  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can inspire a living creature with a touch by
      expending 1 point of mental focus. The creature receives a morale bonus on
      attack rolls equal to 1 + 1 for every 6 occultist levels you possess (to a
      maximum bonus of +4 at 18th level). This bonus also applies on saving
      throws against fear effects. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.</p>
