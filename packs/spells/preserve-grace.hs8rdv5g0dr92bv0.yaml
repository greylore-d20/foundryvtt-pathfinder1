      <p>The Lantern Bearers must often make difficult decisions during their
      missions, such as determining what to do with captured enemies-should they
      be executed, imprisoned, set free, or given a chance to mend their ways?
      With this spell, you grant a creature the ability to foresee moral
      consequences, as if the creature were wearing a <i>phylactery of
      faithfulness</i>. The spell's guidance focuses on the protection of beauty
      and encourages peaceful resolution and mercy.</p>
