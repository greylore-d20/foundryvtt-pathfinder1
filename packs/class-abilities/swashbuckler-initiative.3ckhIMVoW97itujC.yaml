    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she
      gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, if she has the Quick
      Draw feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and she has any single
      light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that isn't hidden, she can draw
      that weapon as part of the initiative check.</p>
