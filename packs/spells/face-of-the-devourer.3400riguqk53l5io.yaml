      <p>You transform the target's face into a hideous shape, such as a
      half-melted visage with insect legs instead of teeth, seeping pits instead
      of eyes, and suckered tongues dangling from its misshapen mouth. You do
      not choose what shape the target's face takes, and the shape is different
      every time you cast the spell. This transformation does not interfere with
      the target's senses or its ability to breathe, though it might prevent it
      from speaking. The target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate
      checks.</p><p>If the target does not normally have a bite attack, it gains
      a bite attack as a natural weapon for the duration of the spell. This bite
      attack deals 1d6 points of damage if the target is Medium, 1d4 points of
      damage if the target is Small, or 1d8 points of damage if the creature is
      Large. The target may use this bite as a primary attack or a secondary
      attack.</p>
