    <p>This spell functions like
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.ik9u3eel5vfwrtb5]{Grease}, except as noted here. When
    you use this spell to cover a solid surface with slippery <em>grease</em>,
    the 10-foot squares must form a continuous area, each part of which must be
    within the spell's range. When you use this spell to create a greasy coating
    on items, no two of the targeted items can be more than 30 feet apart. You
    cannot target both items and surfaces with a single casting of this
    spell.</p>
