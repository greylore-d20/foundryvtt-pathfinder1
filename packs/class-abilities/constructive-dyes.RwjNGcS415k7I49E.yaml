    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist’s dyes congeal and solidify, allowing him to make
      physical objects from them. The alchemist can expend two uses of his daily
      bombs to create a nonmagical object, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.jsvjsax2eabrlx8g]{Minor Creation}, using his
      alchemist level as the spell’s caster level. The alchemist must be at
      least 8th level and have the divine inks discovery before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
