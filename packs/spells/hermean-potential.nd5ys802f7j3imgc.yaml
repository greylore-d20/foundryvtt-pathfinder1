    value: >-
      <p>You gift the target with the ability to perfect its actions via mental
      clarity. On the next attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or
      sk<i>ill</i> check the target attempts, it rolls twice and takes the more
      favorable result. For every 5 caster levels you have, the target can roll
      twice on an additional attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or
      sk<i>ill</i> check (to a maximum of 5 rolls at 20th level). <i>Hermean
      potential</i> is countered and dispelled by <i>ill</i> omenAPG, but does
      not itself counter or dispel <i>ill</i> omen.</p>
