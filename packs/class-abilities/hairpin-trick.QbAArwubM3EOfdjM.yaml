      <p>The rogue is skilled at making do with anything she can find. She takes
      no penalty on Disable Device checks for using improvised tools, and can
      attempt such checks without any tools at a –4 penalty. She treats all
      non-improvised thieves’ tools as masterwork and doubles the bonus she gets
      from masterwork thieves’ tools from +2 to +4.</p>
