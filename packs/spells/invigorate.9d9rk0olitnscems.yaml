      <p>This spell banishes feelings of weariness. For the duration, the
      subject takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions. The
      effect of <i>invigorate</i> is merely an illusion, however, not a
      substitute for actual rest or respite. When the spell ends, the subject
      takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, along with the return of the
      original condition(s). A creature can be under the effects of only one
      <i>invigorate</i> spell at a time; if it is cast a second time on that
      creature, the first immediately ends.</p>
