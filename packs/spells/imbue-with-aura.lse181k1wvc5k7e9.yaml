    value: >-
      <p>You infuse another creature with your divine aura, causing the target
      to radiate an aura identical to your own clerical aura. The target's
      actual alignment is not changed, but spells like <i>detect evil</i> or
      <i>detect good</i> detect only the aura, not the creature's actual
      alignment. For the duration of this spell, effects influenced by the
      target's alignment function according to the imposed aura, not the
      creature's actual aura. When the spell ends, the target's aura returns to
      normal, and alignmentaffecting magic affects it according to its actual
      alignment.</p>
