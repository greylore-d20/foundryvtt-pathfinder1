(The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled&nbsp;<em>spell storing&nbsp;</em>weapon has a 50% chance of having a spell stored in it already. This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;<em>spell storing&nbsp;</em>weapon emits a strong aura of the evocation school, plus the aura of the spell currently stored.</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\"><strong>Construction</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong>&nbsp;Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a caster of at least 12th level;&nbsp;<strong>Price</strong>&nbsp;-</p>"
