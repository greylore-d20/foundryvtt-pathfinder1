    value: >-
      <p>You summon an illusory swarm of angry wasps that fills a
      10-foot-diameter sphere. You can summon it so that it shares an area with
      other creatures, and you can move it up to 40 feet each round as a move
      action. Creatures caught inside the swarm's area of effect cannot use
      skills that require patience or concentration. Additionally, spellcasters
      within the area must succeed at a caster level check (DC =  20 + level of
      spell to be cast) in order to cast spells. On a failed caster level check,
      the spell is lost. While the buzzing is unpleasant, it is not so loud as
      to drown out other noises or make communication difficult.</p>
