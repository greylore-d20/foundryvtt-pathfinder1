      <h3>Statistics</h3><p><b>Damage</b> 1d10 (small), 1d12 (medium);
      <b>Critical</b> 19-20/x2; <b>Range</b> 120 ft.; <b>Type</b>
      P</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The gastraphetes, sometimes called a "belly
      bow," is an oversized crossbow reloaded by pressing one end against the
      ground, the other against one's abdomen, and locking the string in place
      through ratchet action. Reloading takes a full-round action, uses two
      hands, and requires that the wielder be standing. Wielding a gastraphetes
      requires two hands, and due to the weapon's bulk, firing it while standing
      without support (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imposes a -4
      penalty on attack rolls; you take no penalty for firing a gastraphetes
      while prone. A Large or larger creature can use a gastraphetes one size
      smaller than itself without any support, but takes the normal penalty for
      firing an inappropriately sized weapon.</p>
