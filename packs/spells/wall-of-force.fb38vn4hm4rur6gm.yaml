  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A <i>Wall of Force</i> creates an invisible wall of pure force. The
      wall cannot move and is not easily destroyed. A <i>Wall of Force</i> is
      immune to <i>dispel magic</i>, although a mage's disjunction can still
      dispel it.</p><p>A <i>Wall of Force</i> can be damaged by spells as
      normal, except for <i>disintegrate</i>, which automatically destroys it.
      It can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but a <i>Wall of
      Force</i> has hardness 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per
      caster level. Contact with a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> or <i>rod of
      cancellation</i> instantly destroys a <i>Wall of Force</i>.</p><p>Breath
      weapons and spells cannot pass through a <i>Wall of Force</i> in either
      direction, although <i>dimension door</i>, <i>teleport</i>, and similar
      effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as
      material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent the wall
      by going around it, through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks
      can operate through a <i>Wall of Force</i>.</p><p>The caster can form the
      wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square
      per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its
      surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell
      fails.</p><p><i>Wall of Force</i> can be made permanent with a
      <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
