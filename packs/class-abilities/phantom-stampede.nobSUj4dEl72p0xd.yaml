  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman summons a host of ghostly herd beasts to trample a single
      creature. These phantom beasts affect only the target creature, which is
      buffeted and pummeled by their passing. The creature takes no damage from
      the ability, but takes a –4 penalty to its CMD against bull rush, overrun,
      and trip attempts. Additionally, spellcasters under the effect of this
      ability take a –4 penalty on concentration checks. The target receives no
      saving throw to negate this effect.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s level.</p>

      <p>The creature can’t be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
