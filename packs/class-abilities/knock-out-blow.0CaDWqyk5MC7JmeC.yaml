    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, the rogue can forgo her sneak attack damage to attempt to
      knock out an opponent. She must declare the use of knock-out blow before
      she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage, but
      instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and instead of any effect that
      triggers when the rogue deals sneak attack damage), the target falls
      unconscious for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this
      effect to staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2
      the rogue’s level + the rogue’s Intelligence modifier.</p>
