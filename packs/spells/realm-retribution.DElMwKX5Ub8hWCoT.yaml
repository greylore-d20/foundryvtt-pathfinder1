      <p>All attacks made by the target match your alignment, counting as either
      chaotic, evil, good, or lawful as appropriate. If your alignment includes
      multiple alignment components, such as lawful good, you select one
      alignment component to impart to the target. Whenever the target confirms
      a critical hit against or takes damage from a creature, that creature must
      attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the creature is sent to the Outer
      Plane matching your alignment, as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.q3st18udsalnyz5v]{plane shift}, and the spell ends.
      A warpriest treats this spell as a 6th-level cleric spell for the purposes
      of preparing the spell, determining DCs, and so forth.</p>
