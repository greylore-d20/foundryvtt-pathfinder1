Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, the target must make a Will save or be unable to spend any points from its ki pool for a number of rounds equal to the ninja's Charisma modifier. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. The number of points in the target's ki pool is unaffected, and abilities that do not require the subject to spend ki still function.</p>"
