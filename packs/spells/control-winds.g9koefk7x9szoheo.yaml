      <p>You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind
      blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease
      its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell
      ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires
      concentration. You may create an "eye" of calm air up to 80 feet in
      diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to
      limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full
      limit.</p><p><i>Wind Direction</i>: You may choose one of four basic wind
      patterns to function over the spell's area.</p><p></p><ul> <li> A
      downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all
      directions.<p></p><p></p></li><li> An updraft blows from the outer edges
      in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward
      before impinging on the eye in the center.<p></p><p></p></li><li> Rotation
      causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise
      fashion.<p></p><p></p></li><li> A blast simply causes the winds to blow in
      one direction across the entire area from one side to the
      other.</li></ul><p></p><p><i>Wind Strength</i>: For every three caster
      levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each
      round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or
      suffer the effect of being in the windy area. See Environment for more
      details.</p><p>Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.</p><p>A
      severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.</p><p>A
      windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots
      small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and
      endangers ships.</p><p>Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden
      buildings, uproot large trees, and cause most ships to founder.</p><p>A
      tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots
      large trees.</p>
