  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, a samurai can make a last stand once per day whenever he
      makes a challenge. While this challenge is in effect, all melee and ranged
      weapons deal the minimum amount of damage to the samurai, unless the
      attack scored is a critical hit. In addition, the samurai remains
      conscious and is not staggered while he is below 0 hit points. While using
      this ability, the samurai cannot be killed by melee or ranged weapons
      unless they are wielded by the target of his challenge. Attacks made by
      opponents that are not the target of his challenge deal no damage when
      samurai has 0 or fewer hit points. This ability has no effect on spells,
      environmental effects, supernatural abilities, or any other source of
      damage other than melee and ranged weapons. Such sources of damage affect
      him normally and can kill him (although they do not cause him to fall
      unconscious or to become staggered if they reduce his hit points below 0).
      This effect lasts until the challenge ends or the samurai takes an
      offensive action against a target other than the target of his
      challenge.</p>
