You can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier, but only to use the selected feat. You can take other feats to add to this ability, such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.pgRX4VpFemwv9R0E]{Extra Channel}&nbsp;and @Compendium[pf1.feats.1HfwfBOSWtdxFQ2s]{Improved Channel}, but not feats that alter this ability, such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.f5rgOsdDlseGr4o5]{Elemental Channel}&nbsp;and @Compendium[pf1.feats.ieww7CP6JK5pwtpg]{Alignment Channel}. The DC to save against these feats is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. At 20th level, undead cannot add their channel resistance to the save against this ability.</p>"
