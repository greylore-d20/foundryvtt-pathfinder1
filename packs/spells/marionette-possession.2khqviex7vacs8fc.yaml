  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You project your soul out of your body and into the body of a willing
    creature. This possession is blocked by <i>Protection from Evil</i> or a
    similar ward. The target's soul shares its body with you; it is helpless but
    can still use its senses. You and the target's soul can communicate
    telepathically as if using a common language.</p><p>You keep your
    Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save
    bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength,
    Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and natural attacks
    (such as a bite or sting). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to
    make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You
    can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary, spell-like, or
    supernatural abilities.</p><p>As a standard action, you can return to your
    own body, ending the spell. While your soul is possessing the target, your
    body is helpless. If the host body is slain, you return to your own body if
    it is within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is slain). If
    the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host
    die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p>
