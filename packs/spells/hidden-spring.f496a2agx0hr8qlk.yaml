  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You spend 1 hour in quiet meditation, holding the focus component in both
    hands and walking around a natural area. You are simultaneously drawn to
    areas of natural moisture while drawing that moisture closer. As the spell's
    casting time concludes, you thrust the focus component into the ground. From
    that point, a fresh, clean water trickles forth at a rate of 1 gallon every
    10 minutes. You cannot cast this spell inside a building or in an area of
    worked stone, but you can cast it underground. You cannot cast this spell
    within 1 mile of an existing <i>hidden spring</i>.</p>
