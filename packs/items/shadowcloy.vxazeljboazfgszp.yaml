      <p>This thin black liquid is stored in airtight flasks because it
      evaporates quickly when exposed to air. Its cloying vapors cling to a
      target, obscuring vision for a short period of time. You can throw a
      shadowcloy flask as a <em>splash weapon</em> with a range increment of 10
      feet. A direct hit means the target treats the ambient light as one
      category darker than normal, with a creature already in natural darkness
      treating it as <em>supernatural</em> darkness. This effect lasts for 1
      round. A thrown shadowcloy flask has no effect on adjacent creatures or if
      it misses.</p>
