  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and
      enshrouds that creature in mist. This grants the creature concealment as
      the @Compendium[pf1.spells.18kryvj2dfuymk9d]{Blur} spell. The mist
      dissipates after it causes an attack to miss because of concealment or
      after 1 minute, whichever comes first.</p>

      <p>At 8th and 16th levels, the mist lasts for one additional attack.</p>

      <p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24
      hours.</p>
