  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The character can use his performance to foster a sense of growing
      dread in his enemies, causing them to take become
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.JournalEntry.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.XxLUswkCuXnXmA5T]{shaken}.
      To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear
      the bardâ€™s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is
      within 30 feet and the bard continues the performance. The performance
      cannot cause a creature to become
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.JournalEntry.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.uqpJ7ZMnWF5qjOTl]{frightened}
      or
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.JournalEntry.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.nGTsTfpWcJTTU3rk]{panicked},
      even if the targets are already <em>shaken</em> from another effect. Dirge
      of doom is a mind-affecting <em>fear</em> effect, and it relies on audible
      and visual components.</p>
