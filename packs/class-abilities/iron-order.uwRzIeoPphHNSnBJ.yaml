      <p>Once per day, you can issue an order as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zqj5qzyl46af27v0]{Suggestion}. Any creature of
      chaotic alignment has difficulty defying your command, taking a –4 penalty
      on its saving throw to resist it.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, your command function as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.52v3fogun1n9jzum]{Suggestion, Mass}. If you are
      wearing Hellknight plate or a signifer mask, your command’s target takes
      an additional –2 penalty on its saving throw to resist the order
      (regardless of the target’s alignment; this stacks with the penalty
      chaotic creatures take).</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
