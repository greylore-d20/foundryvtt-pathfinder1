  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can cause fire to erupt around you. You can
      create one 10-foot cube of fire per oracle level. These cubes can be
      arranged in any pattern you desire, but each cube must be adjacent to
      another and one must be adjacent to you. Any creature caught in these
      flames takes 1d6 points of fire damage per oracle level, with a Reflex
      save resulting in half damage. This fire lasts for a number of rounds
      equal to your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability once per
      day.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
