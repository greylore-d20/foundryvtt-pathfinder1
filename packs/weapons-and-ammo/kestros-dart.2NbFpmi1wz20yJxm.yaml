    value: >-
      <p>This dart, meant to be thrown using a kestros, consists of a heavy
      metal point about 9 inches long attached to a shaft of wood about 12
      inches long, fletched with feathers for stability. If used as a melee
      weapon, it is a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and
      deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier x2). Kestros
      darts come in a quiver that holds 10 darts.</p>
