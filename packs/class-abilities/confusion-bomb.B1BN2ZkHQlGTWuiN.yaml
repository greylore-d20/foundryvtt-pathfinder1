    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist’s bombs twist the target’s perception of friend and foe.
      A creature that takes a direct hit from a confusion bomb takes damage from
      the bomb and is under the effect of a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.n0bsyxchnigkkuqo]{Confusion} spell for 1 round per
      caster level of the alchemist. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by
      the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage
      deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead).</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
