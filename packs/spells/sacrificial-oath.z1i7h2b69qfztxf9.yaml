  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create a powerful bond between yourself and a single creature. Until
    the end of the spell's duration, each time the target is hit with an attack
    or fails a saving throw, you can take the full damage of that attack and any
    other effects that creature suffers. If you choose not to take on the damage
    and effects, you instead take a number of points of damage equal to your
    Constitution score as backlash. Any resistances or immunities you have are
    applied normally, but you cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or
    effects of either the transfer or the backlash. If you or the subject of the
    spell move out of line of sight, the spell ends.</p>
