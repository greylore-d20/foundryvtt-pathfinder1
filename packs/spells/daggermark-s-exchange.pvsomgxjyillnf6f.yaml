      <p>You swallow a dose of poison with no effect and regurgitate a dose of a
      different poison (your choice) into the old container (or another you have
      on hand). Attempt a Craft (alchemy) check against the new poison's DC. If
      you succeed, you create a dose of your chosen poison. If you fail, the
      poison you regurgitate is inert. If you roll a natural 1, you expose
      yourself to the original poison (although you remain immune to that poison
      if you have venom immunity or a similar class feature or ability). The new
      poison's price must be the same as or less than the original poison's
      price.</p>
