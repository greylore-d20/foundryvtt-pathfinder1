      <p>This spell transforms a creature into a Medium or smaller animal or
      humanoid of no more than 1 Hit Die. If you use this spell to cause the
      target to take on the form of an animal, the spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.774kmgcb7ygviht0]{beast shape II}. If the
      form is that of a humanoid, the spell can function as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.kouqz0pm1xl8xilm]{alter self},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.42ddkxklxocbodnb]{youthful appearance},
      or both, such that you can transform a creature into a generic,
      <em>youthful</em> humanoid of any type. Any creature that interacts with
      the target of this spell must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the DC
      of the spell) or view the target in the most innocuous possible light. On
      a failed saving throw, the creature views all of the target's actions as
      inoffensive and no cause for concern unless the target becomes an obvious
      threat. The creature can otherwise act normally, and feels no compunction
      to obey or ignore the target; it simply assumes none of the target's
      actions are dangerous or malicious unless shown evidence that proves
      otherwise.</p>
