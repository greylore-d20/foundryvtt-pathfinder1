      <p>This functions as <i>thought shield III</i>, but any creature that
      tries to read your thoughts while this spell lasts must succeed at a Will
      save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Additionally, if you succeed at your
      save against a <i>psychic crush</i> spell, you take no damage. This spell
      can be undercast.</p>
