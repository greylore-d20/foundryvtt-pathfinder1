As an immediate action, you can gain a morale bonus equal to half your psychic level (minimum 1) on a single ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. You must declare that you are using this ability before attempting the roll in question. If you succeed at the check, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>"
