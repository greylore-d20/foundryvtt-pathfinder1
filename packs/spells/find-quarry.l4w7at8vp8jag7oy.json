You also discern whether the creature is moving, and its direction, speed, and mode of movement. The radius you can sense increases by 5 miles for every two caster levels you have above 10th (to a maximum of a 45-mile radius at 20th level). Anything that would prevent <i>locate creature</i> from finding a creature also prevents <i>find quarry</i> from doing so.</p>"
