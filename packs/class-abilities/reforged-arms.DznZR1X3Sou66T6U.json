      "value": "<p>The forgeâ€™s fire turns earthen ore into useful metal, and you can hone weapons in the same way. As a standard action, you can touch a metal or stone weapon and transform it into a masterwork equivalent if it is not already a masterwork or magical weapon.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can also have the weapon act as if it were made of alchemical silver or cold iron (your choice when you activate this ability) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the weapon gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus, though this bonus does not stack with any enhancement bonus the weapon already has.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, you can have the weapon act as if it were made of adamantine rather than of alchemical silver or cold iron.</p>\n<p>This effect lasts for 1 minute per oracle level, and you can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>"
