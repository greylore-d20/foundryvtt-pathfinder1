The pantograph is anchored, then fitted with a stylus and a writing implement such as chalk, an ink pen, or a pencil. As the stylus is traced over the drawing or other item to be duplicated, the pantograph reproduces the motions, creating a copy. While handy for making quick, accurate copies of ancient carvings, runes, and drawings, a pantograph is unable to produce a convincing forgery. More elaborate and expensive pantographs allow even larger or smaller copies to be made, or multiple copies to be made at the same time.</p>\r\n<h4><span id=\"Printing_Press\"><a name=\"TOC-Printing-Press\"></a>Printing Press</span></h4>\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO9410</em></p>\r\n<p>A hand-cranked press uses a plate on which all of the text on a page is carved in reverse. Changing the plate is a simple process, but creating a new one is expensive and labor-intensive. The press prints one page at a time, at a rate of about five pages per minute. A stationer then needs to cut and trim the pages and bind the book.</p>\r\n<h4><span id=\"Quill_Poisoned\"><a name=\"TOC-Quill-Poisoned\"></a>Quill, Poisoned</span></h4>\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> PPC:P&amp;P</p>\r\n<p><b>Price</b> 30 gp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>\r\n<p class=\"divider\">DESCRIPTION</p>\r\n<p>This long pen is made from a delicate feather and has a thin and unusually long nib. The quill is typically white in color, though variations that are crimson, onyx, or some combination of these colors also exist. A hidden compartment inside the nib allows the quill to hold a single dose of <em>poison</em> that is dispensable with a small squeeze. Additionally, this provides a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Sleight of Hand</em> checks to conceal poisons inside the quill. If this quill is used with vector ink, it increases the DC of a poison mixed with the ink by 1.</p>\r\n<p>This quill can be used as a small shiv to deal 1d3 points of damage and deliver its contained poison. However, because of the fragility of the nib, using the quill in this way destroys it.</p>\r\n<h4><span id=\"Wax_Sealing\"><a name=\"TOC-Wax-Sealing\"></a>Wax, Sealing</span></h4>\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1110</em></p>\r\n<p>Solid wax used for sealing scroll tubes or <em>scrolls</em> together.</p>                                          <div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments\">\r\n    \r"
