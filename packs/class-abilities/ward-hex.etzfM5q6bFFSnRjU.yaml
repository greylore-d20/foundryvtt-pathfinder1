      <p>A witch can use this hex to place a protective ward over one creature.
      The warded creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2
      resistance bonus on saving throws. This ward lasts until the warded
      creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A witch knows when a warded
      creature is no longer protected. A witch can have only one ward active at
      a time. If the witch uses this ability again, the previous ward
      immediately ends.</p>

      <p>A witch cannot use this ability on herself.</p>

      <p>At 8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this ward increase
      by +1.</p>
