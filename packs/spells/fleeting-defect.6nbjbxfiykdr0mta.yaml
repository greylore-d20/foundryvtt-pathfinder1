  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You cause a single object to temporarily gain the broken condition. The
    target must be a single solid object, regardless of its composition,
    weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Attended objects are allowed a
    Fortitude save. When this spell ends, the object reverts to its original
    quality. An item destroyed while under the effects of this spell remains
    destroyed when this spell ends.  This spell can be cast on a single
    construct to disrupt its animating force. A construct that fails its saving
    throw takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill
    checks, and ability checks for the duration of the spell.</p>
