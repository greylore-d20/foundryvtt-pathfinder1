      "value": "<p>A cavalier belonging to this order specializes in hunting down large monsters and protecting communities from them. Cavaliers of this order tend to value bravery, dedication, and single-minded determination.<br><br><strong>Edicts: </strong>The cavalier must choose an area, whether itâ€™s a settlement or nation, and vows to slay any monster threatening that area. He must fulfill any pledge he makes to slay a beast, tracking it to its lair if necessary, and forsaking any new quarry until his current target is slain. The cavalier must attempt to ensure that no lasting damage is dealt to his domain in the pursuit of his prey.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the hero cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on melee damage rolls against the target of his challenge if it is at least one size category larger than he is. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 cavalier levels he has.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the hero cavalier adds Knowledge (arcana) (Int) and Knowledge (nature) (Int) to his list of class skills. In addition, whenever an order of the hero cavalier uses a Knowledge check to identify a monster, he gains a bonus on this check equal to half his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>"
