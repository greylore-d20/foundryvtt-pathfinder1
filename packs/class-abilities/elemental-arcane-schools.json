      "value": "<p>Instead of specializing in a focused arcane school of magic, a wizard can choose to specialize in one of the&nbsp;<em>elemental schools of magic</em>. Like a normal arcane school, an elemental school grants a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental schoolâ€™s spell list. Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school (<em>air</em>&nbsp;opposes&nbsp;<em>earth</em>,&nbsp;<em>fire</em>&nbsp;opposes&nbsp;<em>water</em>). He does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.</p>"
