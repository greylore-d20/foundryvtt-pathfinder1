      <p>You are surrounded by a soporific aroma that causes living creatures
      that begin their turn or end their movement within 5 feet of you to fall
      asleep for 1 minute. Creatures must save each time they begin their turn
      or end their movement within the <i>cloak of dreams</i>, even if they have
      previously saved against the effect. Sleeping creatures are helpless but
      can be awakened with a standard action or after being
      wounded.</p><p>Creatures with the scent special quality have a -4 penalty
      on their saves.</p>
