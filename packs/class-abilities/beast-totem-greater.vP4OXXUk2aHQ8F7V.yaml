      <p>While raging, the barbarian gains the pounce special ability, allowing
      her to make a full attack at the end of a charge. In addition, the damage
      from her claws increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) and the claws deal Ã—3
      damage on a critical hit. A barbarian must have the beast totem rage power
      to select this rage power.</p>
