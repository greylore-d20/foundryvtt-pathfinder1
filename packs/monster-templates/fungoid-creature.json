This template can be applied to any living, non-plant creature. A fungoid creature’s quick and rebuild rules are the same.<p><strong>Rebuild Rules: </strong>The creature’s type changes to plant, and it gains all of the traits of the plant type. The creature gains telepathy 100 ft. with other fungoid creatures. Its alignment changes to chaotic evil.</p>"
