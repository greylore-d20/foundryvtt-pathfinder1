      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements: </strong>Aberrant or protean subtype; summoner level 9th.</p>\n<p>The eidolon’s mind is dangerously incomprehensible to mortals who contact it. Nonaberrations that read the eidolon’s mind or make mental contact with it take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if you use the sanity rules from&nbsp;Horror Adventures). This contact also includes communication via telepathy—an eidolon that has telepathic capability must initiate this particular contact as a swift action against a single target in order to force its alien consciousness on another creature. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eidolon’s HD + the eidolon’s Charisma modifier) halves the damage. Once a creature has been subjected to the eidolon’s alien consciousness, it is immune to further damage from that eidolon’s alien consciousness for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The eidolon’s summoner is immune to his own eidolon’s alien consciousness, but he can still be affected by other eidolons’ alien consciousnesses. This is a mind-affecting effect.&nbsp;</p>"
