  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This scythe has a spring-loaded blade that folds down into the weapon's
      handle. Opening the scythe blade is a swift action, and closing it again
      is a standard action. You can use Bluff or Sleight of Hand to treat a
      closed switchscythe as a hidden weapon; the apparatus can be disguised
      with 1 minute of work, which grants a +5 bonus on such checks. This
      disguise is ruined when the weapon is opened and must be reapplied to hide
      the weapon again. Any effects that apply to a scythe also apply to a
      switchscythe.</p>
