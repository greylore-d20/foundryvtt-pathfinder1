      <p>When the orange petals of this plant are cured and left to steep in hot
      water, the leaves make a mild, aromatic tea that facilitates restful
      sleep. When taken before sleeping, this tea grants the drinker the
      benefits of a full 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep in only 6 hours. One
      dose of Dreamer's star makes enough tea to serve six.</p>
