      "value": "<p>A number of times per day equal to your <em>Intelligence</em> modifier, you can publicly declare that your next spell is guided by prophecy. When you do, the next spell you cast has a 20% chance of fizzling (1–20 on a d%). If the spell does not fail, treat the spell as if it had been modified by the @Compendium[pf1.feats.77gXSucrxfrE9yWk]{Empower Spell} feat, even if you do not have that feat. At 12th level, the chance that the spell fizzles is reduced to 15% (1–15 on a d%). At 16th level, the chance is reduced to 10% (1–10 on a d%).</p>"
