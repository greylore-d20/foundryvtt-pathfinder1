      "value": "<p>Starting at 5th level, you can spend a full-round action once per day to harness and channel the power of your cybernetic implants into your psychic spellcasting. This increases the saving throw DCs of your psychic spells by 1, and the increase lasts a number of minutes equal to your psychic level. You must have at least one piece of cybertech (Technology Guide&nbsp;35) implanted in you to use this ability.</p>\n<p>Additional implants do not increase the duration or the number of uses of this discipline ability.</p>"
