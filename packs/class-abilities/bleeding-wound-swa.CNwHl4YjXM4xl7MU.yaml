  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, when the swashbuckler hits a living creature with a
      light or one-handed piercing melee weapon attack, as a free action she can
      spend 1 panache point to have that attack deal additional bleed damage.
      The amount of bleed damage dealt is equal to the swashbuckler's Dexterity
      modifier (minimum 1). Alternatively, the swashbuckler can spend 2 panache
      points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed
      damage instead (swashbuckler's choice). Creatures that are immune to sneak
      attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.</p><hr
