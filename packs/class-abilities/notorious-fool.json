      "value": "<p>While in his social identity, the vigilante can feign absentmindedness, clumsiness, drunkenness, or eccentricity very convincingly. When he fails an opposed Sleight of Hand or Stealth check while in his social identity, he can immediately attempt a Bluff check opposed by the onlookersâ€™ Sense Motive checks to appear as though he had only blundered or stumbled in a spectacular fashion. If he succeeds at this Bluff check, the onlookers do not realize the vigilante was attempting the action that prompted him to attempt a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, although being in the wrong place or behaving in an inappropriate manner may still have negative consequences.</p>\n<p>This talent is ineffective against any onlooker who has already witnessed the vigilante faking a blunder within the last 24 hours.</p>"
