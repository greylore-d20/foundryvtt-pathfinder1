If multiple types of alchemical items are poured in, all the contents are ruined. The flask can be thrown as a normal <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon\">splash weapon</a>, and when it breaks, it releases all of the contained <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon\">splash weapons</a> in the same space, and the <i>focusing flask</i> is destroyed. If the items held within the flask normally allow a saving throw to reduce or negate the effects, the target of a <i>focusing flask</i> needs to succeed at only a single saving throw, regardless of the number of items held within the <i>focusing flask</i>. The DC of the saving throw increases by 2 if the flask contains two alchemical items, or by 4 if it contains three items.</p> \n<p class=\"divider\">CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p> \n<p><b>Feats</b> <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/craft-wondrous-item-item-creation\">Craft Wondrous Item</a>; <b>Spells</b> <a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shrink-item\">shrink item</a>; <b>Cost</b> 350 gp</p> \n"
