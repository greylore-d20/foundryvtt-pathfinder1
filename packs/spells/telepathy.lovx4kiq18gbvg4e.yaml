      <p>You can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet
      that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once
      telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more
      than one creature at a time is just as difficult as speaking and listening
      to multiple people simultaneously.</p>
