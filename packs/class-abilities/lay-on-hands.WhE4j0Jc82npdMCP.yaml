  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of
      others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times
      equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her <em>Charisma</em> modifier. With
      one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for
      every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard
      action, unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift
      action. Despite the name of this ability, a paladin only needs one free
      hand to use this ability.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to
      undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the
      paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful
      melee touch attack and doesnâ€™t provoke an <em>attack of opportunity</em>.
      Undead do not receive a <em>saving throw</em> against this damage.</p>
