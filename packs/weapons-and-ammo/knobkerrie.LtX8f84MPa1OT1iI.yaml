      B</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A knobkerrie, or iwisa, is carved from a
      single piece of hardwood with a shaft 2 to 4 feet long surmounted by a
      bulbous knob. The knobkerrie is a traditional hunting weapon among the
      Zenj people of the Mwangi, but it's also used as a symbol of authority.
      Many tribal elders use decorated knobkerries as scepters or canes. A
      knobkerrie is thrown end-over-end. If you are proficient, you gain a +1
      bonus on ranged attack rolls with a knobkerrie against opponents using
      bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields. If you aren't proficient with a
      knobkerrie, treat it as a club.</p>
