    value: >-
      <p>This simple jinx causes a target's hair or fur to fall out in patchy
      clumps, leaving the creature disheveled and less commanding. A jinxed
      creature takes a -2 penalty on all Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform
      checks until the hair begins to regrow 1 week later, or until the damage
      can be concealed with a successful Disguise or Heal check (the DC is equal
      to the original save DC of the spell). A successful <i>break
      enchantment</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or similar effect instantly regrows
      the target's hair or fur and removes the spell's effects.</p>
