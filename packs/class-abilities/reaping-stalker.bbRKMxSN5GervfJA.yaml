  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Some slayers prefer weapons with grim symbolism of lives cut short and
      can wield such weapons with unparalleled lethality. A slayer with this
      talent treats any sickle or scythe he wields as though it were one size
      larger for the purpose of determining its damage dice. In addition, the
      slayer increases the critical threat range of any sickle or scythe he
      wields by 1; this does not stack with other effects that alter a weaponâ€™s
      threat range.</p>
