  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You bind spirits of ill fate to an object, focusing their wrath onto
      the next creature that touches the object. When a creature touches the
      target object, it can attempt a Will save to negate the spell's effect.
      Although a successful save prevents the creature from becoming haunted,
      the haunt still resides within the object, and targets either the next
      creature to touch the object or the same creature again if it still holds
      the object after 24 hours. The haunt remains within the object until a
      creature fails its save or the spell's duration ends.  Once a creature is
      affected by the haunt, it begins noticing a large, black mastiff with
      ominous green eyes watching and following it from a distance, always just
      beyond the range of focus or interaction. The grim stalker terrorizes the
      creature's sleep, affecting it as per <i>nightmare</i> every night during
      the spell's duration (Will negates for one night). Each time the creature
      takes hit point damage, the grim stalker lunges closer, causing the
      creature to become shaken for 1 round (Will negates). Each time the
      creature is reduced to less than one-tenth of its maximum hit points, the
      grim stalker lunges at the creature as an immediate action, affecting it
      as per <i>phantasmal killer</i>.  Each time the grim stalker lunges at the
      affected creature, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that
      round. Alternatively, a haunted creature can attempt to force the grim 
      stalker to manifest using a simple ritual that requires a successful
      Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Spellcraft check; occult
      reagents costing 450 gp (which are consumed as part of the ritual); and a
      full-round action. The DC for this check equals the spell's save DC.
      Successfully performing the ritual causes the grim stalker to manifest as
      a Nessian warhound (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 173) in an available
      square 20 feet away from the victim, save that its only subtype is
      extraplanar, its alignment is neutral, its bite and breath weapon deal
      negative energy damage instead of fire damage, and it has negative energy
      affinity instead of fire immunity and vulnerability to cold. The grim
      stalker immediately attacks the affected creature, persisting until either
      it or the creature is slain, at which point the spell effect (and the
      warhound) disappears.</p>
