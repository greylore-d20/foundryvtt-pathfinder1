  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a medium can use his familiarity with spirits to assist
      him when dealing with haunts. He can always act on the surprise round
      against a haunt, and his touch funnels a portion of the haunt into
      himself, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the haunt per 2 medium levels he
      possesses as if via positive energy and allowing the medium to ask the
      haunt a single question. The haunt can answer the question however it
      chooses. Additionally, the medium can forgo his saving throw against a
      haunt’s effects to funnel the haunt entirely into himself. If he does so,
      the medium suffers the haunt’s full effect, but the haunt doesn’t affect
      anyone else (even if it normally would). The haunt then gains control of
      the medium’s body for 24 hours. Once per minute, the medium can attempt to
      end this possession early by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 the
      medium’s class level).</p>
