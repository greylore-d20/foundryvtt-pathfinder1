When performing a bull rush as part of a charge, if you push the target at least 5 feet, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature as a free action. You are not tripped if you fail this check by 10 or more.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can bull rush or trip creatures two size categories larger than you; for every 4 levels you gain beyond 7th, you can bull rush or trip creatures an additional size category larger.</p>"
