      <p>Your kinetic blast erupts from the ground in a pillar centered anywhere
      within 120 feet of you. The pillar affects all creatures and objects in a
      10-foot-radius cylinder that extends 40 feet above the ground. An energy
      blast infused with eruption deals its normal damage to each target, while
      a physical blast deals half its normal amount of damage. The saving throw
      DC is Dexterity-based.</p>
