    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates a special mystical connection between you and your
      companion creature-animal companion, bonded mount, eidolon, or
      familiar-which allows you to transfer its wounds to you. The creature
      gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on
      saves.</p><p>As an immediate action when your companion takes damage, you
      can take that damage yourself to prevent your companion from being harmed
      (similar to @Compendium[pf1.spells.menqakfoa1ftvi3f]{shield other}, except
      the damage is not split between you and the target). Forms of harm that do
      not involve the loss of hit points, such as charm effects, temporary
      ability damage, level drain, and death effects, are not affected. If the
      creature suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution
      score, you cannot take that damage on behalf of your companion creature
      because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, damage directed
      to you by the spell is not reassigned to the subject.</p><p>If you and
      your companion move out of range of each other, the spell ends.</p>
