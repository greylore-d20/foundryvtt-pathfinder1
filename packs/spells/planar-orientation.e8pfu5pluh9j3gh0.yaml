  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell helps creatures accustomed to the concrete reality of the
      Material Plane to navigate within the confusing realities of other planes.
      When cast, it functions as <i>know direction</i>, save that instead of
      revealing true north, it reveals the direction of the palace or demesnes
      most associated with that plane or demiplane's ruling god or demigod, as
      well as a brief and generic vision of that entity's appearance or holy
      symbol. The spell functions only within whatever plane or demiplane you
      are located in at the time; for instance, if cast within a specific demon
      lord's Abyssal realm or on a given layer of Hell, it would point to the
      seat of power for that demon lord or archdevil, not Lamashtu or Asmodeus.
      If a plane or demiplane has multiple gods or rulers, such as the Eldest of
      the First World or Heaven's various Empyreal Lords and deities, it reveals
      the directions of the closest three, allowing for triangulation.  This
      spell reveals the location of the god or demigod's official seat of power
      only, not the entity itself, and if such a location is deliberately hidden
      via magic of any sort, the spell automatically fails. It does not function
      on the Material Plane.</p>
