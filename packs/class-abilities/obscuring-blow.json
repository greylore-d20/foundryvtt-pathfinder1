      "value": "<p>Once per day, the rogue can forgo her potential to deal sneak attack damage to attempt to cloud an opponent’s vision. She must declare the use of obscuring blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage but, instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and any effect that triggers when the rogue deals sneak attack damage), the target treats all other creatures as if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to half the rogue’s level. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces this effect to 1 round. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue’s level + the rogue’s Intelligence modifier.</p>"
