  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse
    ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands
    free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet and
    a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb
    checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A
    <i>spider climbing</i> creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class
    (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks
    against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.</p>
