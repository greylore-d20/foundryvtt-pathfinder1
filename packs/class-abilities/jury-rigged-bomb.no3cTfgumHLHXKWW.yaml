      <p>Unlike normal bombs, jury-rigged bombs can be created from whatever
      materials the alchemist has on hand; this makes them particularly handy in
      situations where the alchemist might find himself imprisoned or stripped
      of his equipment. Jury-rigged bombs can be crafted and thrown as a swift
      action (this counts against the alchemist’s daily use of bombs), and they
      deal only 1d4 points of damage + additional damage equal to half the
      alchemist’s Intelligence modifier on a direct hit. This damage increases
      by 1d4 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Despite being useful in
      a pinch, jury-rigged bombs are nonetheless crudely crafted and highly
      unstable; if the alchemist’s attack roll results in a natural 1, the bomb
      explodes as he is creating it, and he takes damage as if he had taken a
      direct hit.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p><hr /><p><strong>Usage</strong>: link charges to
