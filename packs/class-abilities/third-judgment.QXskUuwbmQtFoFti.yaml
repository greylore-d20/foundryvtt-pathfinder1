  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she
      selects three different judgments, instead of just two. This only consumes
      one use of her judgment ability. As a swift action, the inquisitor can
      change one of these judgments to another type.</p>
