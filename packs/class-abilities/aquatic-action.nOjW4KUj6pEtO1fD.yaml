  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante uses weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes in
      aquatic environments as though under the effect of freedom of movement,
      including when making melee attacks against targets in the water while the
      vigilante is on land. The vigilante ignores limitations and penalties on
      ranged attacks, including thrown weapons, imposed by being underwater for
      the first 15 feet. (See Underwater Combat on page 432 of the Pathfinder
      RPG Core Rulebook for more information.)</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 8th level to select this talent.</p>
