  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman turns the air frigid around a target within 30 feet for a
      number of rounds equal to the shamanâ€™s Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The
      target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw at the beginning of each turn
      or be damaged by exposure to the extreme cold. On a failed save, the
      target takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. On a successful save, the
      effect ends immediately.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the initial save is successful, the creature cannot be
      the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>
