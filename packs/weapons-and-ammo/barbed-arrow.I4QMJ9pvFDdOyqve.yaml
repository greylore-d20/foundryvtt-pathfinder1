      <p>The head of a barbed arrow resembles that of a harpoon.</p>

      <p>When a barbed arrow is attached to a length of silk rope and fired from
      a bow, the arrow's range increment is reduced to 30 feet, but it gains the
      <b>grapple special weapon quality</b> (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate
      Equipment</em> 22).</p>

      <p>Barbed bolts exist for crossbows.</p>
