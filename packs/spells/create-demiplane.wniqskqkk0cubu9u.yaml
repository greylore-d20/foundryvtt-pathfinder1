  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>create lesser demiplane</i>, except the area
      is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this
      spell to expand a demiplane you created with <i>create lesser
      demiplane</i> (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this
      spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively,
      when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the
      following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in
      which case it has an instantaneous duration.</p><p>Alignment: Your plane
      gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned
      alignment trait (see Alignment Traits, <i>GameMastery Guide</i> 187). You
      cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not
      have.</p><p>Bountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology,
      with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough
      plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one
      Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane
      does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology
      can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring
      watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material
      decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has
      ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is
      a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants
      adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.</p><p>Elemental: Your
      plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water-elemental dominant trait
      (see Elemental and Energy Traits, <i>GameMastery Guide</i>
      186).</p><p>Gravity: By default a demiplane's gravity is normal and
      oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the
      Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane's gravity is heavy,
      light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional (see
      Gravity, <i>GameMastery Guide</i> 184).</p><p>Seasonal: The demiplane has
      a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on
      the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your
      demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4
      hours, and so on).</p><p>Shape: By default, the demiplane has a fixed
      shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane
      self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge
      (see Shape and Size, <i>GameMastery Guide</i> 185). You may designate
      areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a
      pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire
      plane.</p><p>Structure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical
      structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and
      so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without
      having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you
      need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).</p><p>You can make
      this spell permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell, at a cost of 20,000
      gp. If you have cast <i>create demiplane</i> multiple times to enlarge the
      demiplane, each casting's area requires its own <i>permanency</i>
      spell.</p>
