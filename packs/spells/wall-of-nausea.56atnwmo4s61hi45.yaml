      <p>You create a transparent, shimmering wall through which creatures and
      objects appear to be wildly distorted to viewers. Any creature that passes
      through the wall is immediately assailed by overwhelming vertigo, becoming
      nauseated for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save; if
      nauseated, the creature must also succeed at a DC 12 Acrobatics check or
      fall prone. Creatures gain partial concealment (20% miss chance) against
      creatures on the other side of the wall.</p><p>The wall must be vertical
      and rectangular. It need not touch the ground. The wall must be continuous
      and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or
      creature when it is cast, the spell fails.</p>
