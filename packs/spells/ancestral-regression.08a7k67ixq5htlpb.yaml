      <p>The target drow transforms into a surface elf. The drow loses her
      darkvision and light-blindness racial traits and gains the low-light
      vision racial trait in their place. The alignment and personality of the
      drow are not affected by the transformation, but the spell conceals her
      alignment as an <i>undetectable alignment</i> spell. The spell grants the
      target a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as an elf, though she
      appears to be an elven analog of herself and can be recognized as such by
      other drow who know her.</p>
