  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can touch a willing creature with divine power,
      giving it a saving throw against each effect currently affecting it, using
      the original saving throw DC of the effect. Each successful saving throw
      ends the related effect. The creature can choose not to make a save
      against an effect. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level,
      plus one additional time per day at 14th and 20th level.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Aura of Protection power of the Protection
      Domain.</p>
