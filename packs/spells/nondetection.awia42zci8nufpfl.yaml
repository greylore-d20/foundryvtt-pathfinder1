      <p>The warded creature or object becomes difficult to <i>detect</i> by
      divination spells such as <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate
      object,</i> and <i>detect</i> spells. <i>Nondetection</i> also prevents
      location by such magic items as <i>crystal ball</i>s. If a divination is
      attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the
      divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)
      against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast
      <i>nondetection</i>. If you cast <i>nondetection</i> on yourself or on an
      item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster
      level.</p><p>If cast on a creature, <i>nondetection</i> wards the
      creature's gear as well as the creature itself.</p>
