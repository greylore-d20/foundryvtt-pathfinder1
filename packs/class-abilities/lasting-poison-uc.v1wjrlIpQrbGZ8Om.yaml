  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a weapon in such a way
      that it is effective for a number of successful attacks equal to her
      Dexterity modifier (minimum two) instead of one. This poison has a reduced
      effect, however, and saves made against the poison gain a +2 circumstance
      bonus.</p><p>Applying poison in this way is a full-round action, or a
      standard action if the rogue has the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.25YEZqTGeFCUSF3L]{swift poison}
      rogue talent.</p>
