    value: >-
      <p><em>You can make additional attacks of
      opportunity.</em><p><b>Benefits</b><br>You may make a number of additional
      attacks of opportunity per round equal to your Dexterity bonus. With this
      feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while
      flat-footed.<p><b>Normal</b><br>A character without this feat can make
      only one attack of opportunity per round and can't make attacks of
      opportunity while flat-footed.<p><b>Special</b><br>The Combat Reflexes
      feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability more than once
      per round.<p><b>Combat Trick</b><br>When you miss with an attack of
      opportunity, you can spend 5 stamina points to make a second attack for
      the same provoking action. That second attack of opportunity takes a -5
      penalty on the attack roll and costs one of your attacks of opportunity
      for the round.</p>

      <p><b>Usage</b>: spend 1 charge after use.</p>
