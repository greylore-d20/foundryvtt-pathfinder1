      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>These large siege engines are typically wheeled or attached to vehicles
      that can transport them to the battlefield. This apparatus fires gouts of
      alchemist's fire in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone (siege crew
      leader's choice). Targets in the area take 6d6 points of fire damage (DC
      15 Reflex save halves); those who fail their saves also catch on fire.</p>

      <p>A firedrake with the broken condition that suffers a further mishap
      explodes, dealing its damage to all creatures within a 20-foot blast (DC
      15 Reflex save halves). Firedrakes have a hardness of 10 and 70 hit
      points.</p>

      <p>One use of firedrake ammunition costs 200 gp and weighs 20 pounds.</p>
