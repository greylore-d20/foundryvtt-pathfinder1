      <p>To use this spell, you first touch the intended recipient, creating a
      sympathetic field of healing energies between you.</p><p>Once the spell
      has been cast, you and the target may cast conjuration (healing) spells
      with a range of touch upon each other so long as you are within close
      range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Should either you or the target remove
      your bracelet, the spell immediately ends.</p>
