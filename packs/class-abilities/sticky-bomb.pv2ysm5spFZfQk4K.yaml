  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The effects of the alchemist's bombs are persistent and continue to
      damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take
      a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later.
      Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead
      have those effects occur 2 rounds later.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
