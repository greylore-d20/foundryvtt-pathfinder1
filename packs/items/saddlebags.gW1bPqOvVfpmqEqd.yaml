      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>These sturdy, weatherproof bags are draped over a saddle to add extra
      carrying capacity. Each side of a saddlebag can typically carry 20 pound
      of items that can fit in the bags. Saddlebags do not increase the amount
      of weight a mount can carry; they merely give riders a place to stow their
      equipment.</p>
