You can reload such weapons quickly.</em></p>\n<p><b>Prerequisite</b></p>\n<p>Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).</p>\n<p><b>Benefit</b></p>\n<p>The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<p>If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.</p>\n<p><b>Normal</b></p>\n<p>A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.</p>\n<p><b>Special</b></p>\n<p>You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.</p>"
