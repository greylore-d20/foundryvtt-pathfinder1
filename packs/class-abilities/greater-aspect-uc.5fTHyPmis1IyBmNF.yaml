  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon's evolutions
      to himself. This ability functions as the
      @Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.Zy94TROPC7Es6yA7]{aspect} ability, but the
      maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6.
      In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2
      points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1
      point from the evolution pool for each point diverted.</p>
