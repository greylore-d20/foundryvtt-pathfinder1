      <p>Bloody mandrakes grow from the corpses of intelligent creatures who had
      <em>supernatural</em> powers in life. This <em>plant's</em> unsettlingly
      <em>humanoid</em>-shaped tuber-like roots increase fertility and vitality.
      Gather DC 20; <b>Yield</b> 1d4 doses</p>

      <p><b>Terrain</b> any plains or swamps</p>

      <p><b>Preparation</b> A bloody mandrake must be pulped so that its sticky
      red sap can be gathered, skimmed, and then refined into an even stickier
      paste; this process requires a successful DC 15 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy)
      check and 1d4 hours of work per yield.</p>

      <p><b>Use</b> One dose of bloody mandrake paste smeared on the lips (this
      is a <em>free action</em>) during spellcasting can be used as an
      additional material component when casting spells that remove afflictions
      and conditions or that provide a <em>morale bonus</em>. Doing so grants a
      +1 bonus to the spell's effective <em>caster level</em>.</p>
