      <p>Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak
      any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is
      allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the
      creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of
      this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which
      they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as
      they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the
      area are free to speak as they choose.</p>
