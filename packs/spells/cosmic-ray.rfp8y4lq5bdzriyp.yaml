  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You fling a ray of deadly cosmic energy at the target creature. If you
    succeed at a ranged touch attack with the ray, the target takes 1d6 points
    of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and must make a Fortitude save. On
    a failed save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round per caster level and
    emits toxic cosmic energy for as long as it is sickened; any creature that
    comes within 5 feet of the affected target must succeed at a Fortitude save
    (DC = spell's DC) or become sickened for 1 round per 2 caster levels.</p>
