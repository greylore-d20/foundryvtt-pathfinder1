  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can make the water in a 10-foot radius around her sludgy and
      viscous for 1 minute, causing it to function as difficult terrain for all
      swimming creatures except herself. This also provides partial cover
      against physical effects that pass through the affected area.</p>
