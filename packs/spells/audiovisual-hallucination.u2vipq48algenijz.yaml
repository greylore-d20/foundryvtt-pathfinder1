      <p>This spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.uab18yhecv8djvbg]{auditory hallucination}, except
      that you can include the image of any object, creature, or force you
      imagine or identify for the targets to imagine. You can move the image
      while you concentrate. After you cease concentration, you can define
      simple movements or changes for the phantasm to perform that can be
      explained in 25 words or fewer.  The image disappears when struck by an
      opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately or instruct
      it to do so. Its AC is equal to 10 + the level of this spell.</p>
