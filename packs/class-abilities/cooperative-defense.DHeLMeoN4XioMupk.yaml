    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, whenever a spell or effect targets you and one or more
      allies within 30 feet, you can use this ability to allow your allies to
      use your saving throw against the effect in place of their own. Each ally
      must make this choice individually before the rolls are made. Using this
      ability is an immediate action. You can use this ability once per day at
      8th level, and one additional time per day for every four wizard levels
      beyond 8th.</p>
