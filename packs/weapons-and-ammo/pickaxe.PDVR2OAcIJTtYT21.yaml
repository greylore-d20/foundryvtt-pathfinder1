  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A two-handed version of the heavy pick, the brutal pickaxe is equally
      effective at breaking up earth and stone as it is at sundering flesh and
      bone. Often a weapon of convenience for commoners, the pickaxe is also a
      favorite among brutes and thugs who value the intimidation factor afforded
      by the immense weapon.</p>
