  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, a character with this talent can craft simple but
      effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The character needs 1
      minute to prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is good for the
      rest of the day or until the character fails a saving throw against an
      area effect spell that deals fire, cold, or acid damage, whichever comes
      first. The character gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks while within
      terrain that matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability
      cannot be used in areas without natural foliage.</p>
