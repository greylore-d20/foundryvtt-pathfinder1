      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, the cavalier does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she attacks foes while unarmed so long as she is dealing nonlethal damage. In addition, the cavalierâ€™s unarmed strikes deal more nonlethal damage than usual; she is treated as having a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Monk\">monk levels</a>&nbsp;equal to her cavalier level for the purpose of determining how much nonlethal damage her unarmed strikes deal. For example, a 12th-level cavalier of the order of the hammer would deal 2d6 points of nonlethal damage with her unarmed strike. The cavalier must still select the @Compendium[pf1.feats.2aTFNMs3pW6nUBlr]{Improved Unarmed Strike}&nbsp;feat if she wants to deal lethal damage with her unarmed strike, and lethal damage dealt with her unarmed strike is not increased by this ability.</p>"
