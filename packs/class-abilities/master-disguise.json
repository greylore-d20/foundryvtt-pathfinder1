      "value": "<p>A ninja with this trick can take on the appearance of other creatures and individuals. Whenever the ninja uses the sudden disguise ninja trick, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level. Alternatively, the ninja can use the sudden disguise ninja trick to take on the appearance of a specific individual that the ninja has seen before for 1 minute per level. Creatures that are familiar with the individual receive a Will saving throw to see through the illusion. The DC of this saving throw is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. This illusion also changes the ninja's speech, if she has heard the individual talk and can speak his language.</p>\n<p>The ninja must have the sudden disguise ninja trick before selecting this trick.</p>"
