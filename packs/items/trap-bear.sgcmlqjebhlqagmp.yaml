      <p>Bear Trap CR 1</p>

      <p><b>Price</b> 2 gp; <b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.</p>

      <p><b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Locate</b> <em>Perception</em> DC 15;
      <b>Disarm</b> <em>Disable Device</em> DC 20; <b>Trigger</b> location;
      <b>Reset</b> manual</p>

      <p><b>Effect</b> Atk +10 melee (2d6+3); sharp jaws spring shut around the
      creature's ankle and halve the creature's base speed (or hold the creature
      immobile if the <em>trap</em> is attached to a solid object); the creature
      can escape with a DC 20 <em>Disable Device</em> check, DC 22 <em>Escape
      Artist</em> check, or DC 26 <em>Strength</em> check.</p>

      <p>Although intended for trapping large <em>animals</em>, bear traps work
      as well for trapping <em>humanoids</em> or monsters. The hinged jaws of
      the <em>trap</em> are attached to a chain, which in turn is secured to a
      spike driven into the ground to ensure that the victim cannot simply crawl
      away. Prying open the jaws or pulling the spike from the ground requires a
      DC 20 <em>Strength</em> check.</p>

      <h5>Offset Bear Trap CR 1/2</h5>

      <p><b>Weight</b> 10 lbs.; <b>Price</b> 3 gp</p>

      <p><b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Notice</b> <em>Perception</em> DC 15;
      <b>Disable</b> <em>Disable Device</em> DC 20</p>

      <p><b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Reset</b> manual</p>

      <p><b>Effect</b> Atk +10 melee (1d6+2); jaws spring shut around the
      creature's ankle and hold the creature immobile; the creature can escape
      with a DC 20 <em>Disable Device</em> check, DC 24 <em>Escape Artist</em>
      check, or DC 28 <em>Strength</em> check.</p>

      <p>An offset <em>bear trap</em> is a specialized variety of a <em>bear
      trap</em> constructed with offset jaws coated in resin.</p>

      <p>It inflicts less damage on captured creatures but holds them more
      securely, and is therefore primarily used by <em>trappers</em> or bounty
      <em>hunters</em> who do not want to risk killing their prey. Offset bear
      traps are almost always secured to the ground by a heavy spike and
      <em>chain</em> so the captured creature can't wander far.</p>

      <h5>Sawtooth Bear Trap CR 5</h5>

      <p><b>Weight</b> 20 lbs.; <b>Price</b> 1,800 gp</p>

      <p><b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Notice</b> <em>Perception</em> DC 25;
      <b>Disable</b> <em>Disable Device</em> DC 25</p>

      <p><b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Reset</b> manual</p>

      <p><b>Effect</b> Atk +15 melee (3d6+9); serrated jaws spring shut around
      the creature's ankle and halve the creature's base speed (or hold the
      creature immobile if the <em>trap</em> is attached to a solid object); the
      creature can escape with a DC 25 <em>Disable Device</em> check, DC 28
      <em>Escape Artist</em> check, or DC 32 <em>Strength</em> check.</p>

      <p>A sawtooth <em>bear trap</em> has vicious jaws and tighter springs.</p>

      <p>Used primarily against <em>humanoids</em> or monsters rather than
      <em>animals</em>, sawtooth bear traps are often painted in camouflaged
      colors to <em>blend</em> in with the <em>trap</em> site. Most include
      locking plates over the spring mechanisms to prevent tampering by
      intelligent victims.</p>
