  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions as <i>mental barrier <i>II</i>I</i>, but if you
      are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 25% chance that
      the additional damage is negated (as <i>light</i> fortification). This
      does not stack with similar effects that negate the additional damage from
      a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to <i>mind
      thrust I</i> and <i>II</i>, and you take half damage from <i>mind thrust
      I</i><i>II</i>, <i>I<i>V</i></i>, and <i>V</i> (reduced to one-quarter on
      a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.</p>
