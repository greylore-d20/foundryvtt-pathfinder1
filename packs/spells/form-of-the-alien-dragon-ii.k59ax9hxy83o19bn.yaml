      <p>This spell functions as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.g3d29t4amz91ewy5]{Form of the Alien
      Dragon I}, except it also allows you to assume the form of a Large
      esoteric or outer dragon. Psychics can choose from the esoteric dragon
      (astral, dream, etheric, nightmare, or occult) forms only. You gain the
      following abilities: a +6 size bonus to your Strength, a +4 size bonus to
      your Constitution, a +6 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 90 feet
      (poor), darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a breath weapon, damage
      reduction 5/magic, and resistance to one form of energy or effect. You
      also gain one bite attack (2d6), two claw attacks (1d8), a tail slap
      attack (1d8), and two wing attacks (1d6). All breath weapons deal 6d8
      points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve
      the normal damage. Line breath weapons increase to 80-foot lines and cones
      increase to 40-foot cones.</p>
