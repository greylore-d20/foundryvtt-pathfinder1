    value: >-
      <p>You create a crackling lash of unholy lightning that flickers and
      flashes in your hand like a whip, shifting color in response to your mood
      and will. Once per round, you can make a melee touch attack with the
      <i>lightning lash</i> against a target within 15 feet. If the attack is
      successful, it deals 1d6 points of electricity damage and 1d6 points of
      damage from divine power (similar to <i>flame</i> strike), and allows you
      to attempt a trip combat maneuver check as a free action against your
      target (using your caster level as your CMB).</p>
