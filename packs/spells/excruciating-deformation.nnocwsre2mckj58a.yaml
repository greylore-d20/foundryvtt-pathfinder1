  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your touch attack causes your target to become painfully malformed. Its
      limbs twist and buckle, while its body contorts uncontrollably, shifting
      and warping. Each round the target suffers excruciating pain and takes 2d6
      points of nonlethal damage, 1 point of Dexterity damage, and 1 point of
      Constitution damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. Once per round
      as a free action on its turn, the target can attempt a new Fortitude
      saving throw to resist the spell for 1 round.</p>
