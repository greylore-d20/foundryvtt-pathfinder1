      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Both<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes<p>“Half-dragon” is an inherited or
      acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature
      (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-dragon retains all
      the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted
      here.<p><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature + 2 (minimum
      3).<p><b>Type:</b> Creature type changes to dragon. Do not recalculate HD,
      BAB, or saves.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> Nat. armor improves by
      +4.<p><b>Special Qualities and Defenses:</b> A half-dragon gains
      darkvision 60 feet; low-light vision; and immunity to sleep, paralysis,
      and energy of the same type as its breath weapon.<p><b>Speed:</b> A
      half-dragon has wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed,
      the half-dragon can fly at twice the creature's base land speed (average
      maneuverability).<p><b>Melee:</b> A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a
      bite attack. If the base creature can use manufactured weapons, the
      half-dragon can as well. A new claw or bite attack deals damage as
      appropriate for the half-dragon's size (see Natural Attacks.)<p><b>Special
      Abilities:</b> A half-dragon retains all the special attacks of the base
      creature and gains a breath weapon usable once per day based on the dragon
      variety (see below). The breath weapon deals 1d6 hit points of damage per
      racial HD possessed by the half-dragon (Reflex half; DC 10 + 1/2
      creature's racial HD + creature's Con modifier).</p>
