      <p><strong>Slot</strong> none</p><p>This round, rainbow-hued glass flask
      allows up to three alchemical <em>splash weapons</em> of the same type to
      be poured into it, concentrating them such that they never increase its
      weight noticeably. If multiple types of alchemical items are poured in,
      all the contents are ruined. The flask can be thrown as a normal
      <em>splash weapon</em>, and when it breaks, it releases all of the
      contained <em>splash weapons</em> in the same space, and the <em>focusing
      flask</em> is destroyed. If the items held within the flask normally allow
      a saving throw to reduce or negate the effects, the target of a
      <em>focusing flask</em> needs to succeed at only a single saving throw,
      regardless of the number of items held within the <em>focusing flask</em>.
      The DC of the saving throw increases by 2 if the flask contains two
      alchemical items, or by 4 if it contains three items.</p><p>CONSTRUCTION
