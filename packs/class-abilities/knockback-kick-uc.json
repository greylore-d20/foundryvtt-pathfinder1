      "value": "<p>The monk attempts to knock his foe back with a powerful kick. If the attack hits, the monk can attempt a free combat maneuver check against the foe (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). If the check is successful, the foe is knocked 10 feet directly away from the monk. This distance increases by 10 feet for every 5 by which the check exceeds the foe’s CMD, to a maximum distance equal to the monk’s fast movement bonus.</p>\n<p>This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The foe stops moving if it strikes another creature, barrier, or otherwise solid object. The creature is not knocked prone by this movement.</p>\n<p>The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.</p>"
