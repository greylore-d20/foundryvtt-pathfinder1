      "value": "<p>Sabriune has passed on the secret of swiftly manufacturing drow poison. Once per day, the rogue can create 1 or more doses of drow poison by spending 25 gp per dose; this process takes 30 minutes of work, regardless of the number of doses she creates. She can create no more than 1 dose for every 3 rogue levels she has (minimum 1 dose). Creating drow poison in this way does not require a skill check, but the created poison spoils if not used within 24 hours. (This spoilage means that selling doses of this poison for a profit to unsuspecting merchants might well result in unwanted repercussions and reprisals!)</p>"
