      <p>Prized among those who seek to monitor the attention paid to them, this
      spell is said to be used by Arazni to identify those followers who dare
      refer to her as "the Harlot Queen" so she might summarily dismiss them.
      When you cast this spell, designate a word, phrase, or name. If a creature
      within 1 mile of you uses that word, phrase, or name to refer to you, you
      immediately learn that creature's name, appearance, and location. This
      discharges the spell.</p>
