  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, as a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack
      against a foe to conjure icy restraints around its ankles, reducing its
      base speed to 5 feet and dealing it an amount of cold damage at the
      beginning of its turn equal to your Intelligence modifier. The manacles
      have AC 10, hardness 0, and 30 hit points, and a creature can destroy them
      with a successful Strength check (DC = 10 + half your wizard level + your
      Intelligence modifier) as a standard action. The icy shackles melt away
      after 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
      to your Intelligence modifier.</p>
