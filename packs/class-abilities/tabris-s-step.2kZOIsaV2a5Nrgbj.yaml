    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, a magus can spend 1 point from his arcane pool and
      gain the effects of a water walk spell for 10 minutes per magus level. If
      he expends 2 points from his arcane pool, he can affect a total number of
      touched creatures equal to his magus level.</p>
