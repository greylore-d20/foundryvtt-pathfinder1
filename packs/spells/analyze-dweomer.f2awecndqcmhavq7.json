In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.</p><p>An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other <i>analyze dweomer</i> spells for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Analyze dweomer</i> does not function when used on an artifact.</p>"
