  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You give a creature the ability to redirect a portion of its innate
      toughness away from its own defense and toward the amount of damage it
      deals with natural attacks. Each round, as a swift action at the start of
      its turn, the creature can choose to reduce some or all of its natural
      armor bonus to AC and gain an enhancement bonus on all damage rolls for
      natural attacks equal to that amount. The reduction to natural armor, and
      thus the enhancement bonus on damage rolls, cannot exceed 1 point per 3
      caster levels, to a maximum penalty/bonus of -5/+5 at 15th level. A
      creature cannot reduce its natural armor bonus to less than 0 with this
      spell.</p><p>All attacks directed against the creature use its adjusted AC
      until the start of its next turn, at which time it can choose to modify
      its AC again or keep it at its current level. Creatures make this decision
      without any need for conscious thought or reflection; even creatures with
      no Intelligence score can benefit from this spell, although they always
      opt for the maximum possible reduction and bonus, regardless of any
      tactical advantage they might lose.</p>
