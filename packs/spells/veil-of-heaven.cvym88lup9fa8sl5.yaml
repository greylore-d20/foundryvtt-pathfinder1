      <p>You surround yourself with a veil of positive energy, making it harder
      for evil outsiders to harm you. For the duration of this spell, you gain a
      +2 sacred bonus to AC and on saves. Both of these bonuses apply only
      against attacks or effects created by outsiders with the evil subtype. You
      can dismiss this spell as a swift action to deal 1d8 points of damage + 1
      point per paladin level to all such outsiders within 5 feet. A Will save
      halves this damage.</p>
