The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage.</p>\n<p>If the mesmerist is 12th level or higher, the subject takes only half damage if she fails her save. The benefits of this trick donâ€™t stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.</p>"
