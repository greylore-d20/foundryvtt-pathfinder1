      "value": "<p><b>Holy Text</b> This is the religious text of a particular religion, with a title, text, and detailed rites specific to that faith. The cheap variety is a small, light book with no illustrations, printed or written on thin paper, and with a cover made of <em>canvas</em> or thin leather. A typical <em>holy text</em> for an experienced adventuring priest is durable, with a leather cover, chapter illustrations, quality paper; it costs 25 gp and weighs 2 pounds. The most expensive versions have detailed illustrations, gilded initials and border decorations, covers made of fine leather, wood, or even metal, and are often oversized and difficult to carry around. <b>Price</b> 1-100 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1-20 lbs.</p>"
