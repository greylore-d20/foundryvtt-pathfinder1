  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian gains a bite attack. If used as part of a
      full attack action, the bite attack is made at the barbarian's full base
      attack bonus â€“5. If the bite hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage (assuming
      the barbarian is Medium; 1d3 points of damage if Small) plus half the
      barbarian's Strength modifier. A barbarian can make a bite attack as part
      of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. This attack is
      resolved before the grapple check is made. If the bite attack hits, any
      grapple checks made by the barbarian against the target this round are at
      a +2 bonus.</p>
