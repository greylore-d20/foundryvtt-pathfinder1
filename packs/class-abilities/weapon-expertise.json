      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, a samurai gains an unparalleled expertise with his chosen weapons. At 3rd level, the samurai selects either the katana, longbow, naginata, or wakizashi. The samurai can draw the selected weapon as a free action as if he had the @Compendium[pf1.feats.WKIVfdosc5SqYzmP]{Quick Draw} feat. In addition, whenever he threatens a critical hit with the selected weapon, he gains a +2 bonus on the confirmation roll. Finally, his samurai levels count as fighter levels and stack with any fighter levels he possesses for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites for feats that specifically select his chosen weapon, such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.YLCvMNeAF9V31m1h]{Weapon Specialization}.</p>"
