  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An alchemical cartridge is a prepared bundle of black powder with a
      bullet or pellets, sometimes with more exotic material added, which is
      then wrapped in paper or cloth and sealed with beeswax, lard, or tallow.
      There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the
      paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a
      bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the
      time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard
      action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes
      a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a
      weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each
      entry.</p><p><strong>Gray Dust Shot</strong>: This version of the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.weapons-and-ammo.Item.W7fsZRvBkO02fsEz]{gray dust
      cartridge} can be loaded only into a weapon with the scatter quality. It
      functions similarly to a gray dust cartridge, except upon impact it bursts
      into a 20-foot-radius cloud. Creatures within the cloud take a -5 penalty
      on concentration checks to cast spells. This cloud dissipates in 1d6
      rounds in still air. Light wind disperses the cloud in 1 round.</p>
