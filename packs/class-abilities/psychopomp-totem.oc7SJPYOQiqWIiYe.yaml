    value: >-
      <p>The first time each round a creature with regeneration or fast healing
      is struck by the barbarian while she is raging, the creature must succeed
      at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the barbarian's level + the barbarian's
      Strength modifier) or that ability is suppressed for 1 round.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the lesser psychopomp totem rage power and be at
      least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
