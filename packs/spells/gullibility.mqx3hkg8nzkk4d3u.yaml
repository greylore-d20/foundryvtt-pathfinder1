      <p>You befuddle the target's mind, making it more willing to believe even
      the most outlandish tales. The target takes a -10 penalty on Sense Motive
      checks for the spell's duration. In addition, creatures that attempt to
      lie to or deceive the target gain a +10 bonus on their Bluff checks, as if
      the target wanted to believe them and was drunk or impaired
      simultaneously. Furthermore, the believability of any lie told to a
      creature under the effects of <i>gullibility</i> increases by one step; an
      impossible lie seems far-fetched, a far-fetched lie seems unlikely, and an
      unlikely lie seems believable.  A creature gains no benefits from
      <i>glibness</i> on B luff checks to lie to or deceive a creature that is
      under the effects of <i>gullibility</i>; in effect, <i>gullibility</i> r
      enders a t arget s o w illing t o believe what others say that
      <i>glibness</i> cannot make their words any more believable.</p>
