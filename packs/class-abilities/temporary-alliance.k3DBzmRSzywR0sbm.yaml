  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, an order of the eel cavalier gains the ability to create
      a meaningful, if temporary, alliance with another individual. As a
      full-round action, the cavalier enters into an alliance with a willing
      creature that has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The creature
      thereafter receives a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls against targets
      the cavalier threatens and on saving throws against spells and effects
      generated by those targets. These bonuses last for 1 hour for every 2
      cavalier levels the order of the eel cavalier has or until the cavalier
      creates a new alliance with a different creature. A cavalier can have only
      one alliance active at a time; if he creates a new alliance while under
      the effects of an existing alliance, the existing alliance immediately
      ends and the new one takes effect.</p>
