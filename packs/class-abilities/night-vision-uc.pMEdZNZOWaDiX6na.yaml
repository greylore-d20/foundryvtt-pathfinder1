  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarianâ€™s senses grow incredibly sharp, and she gains darkvision
      out to a range of 60 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range of
      that darkvision increases by 60 feet.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have a darkvision racial trait, low-light vision
      racial trait, or the low-light vision rage power to select this rage
      power.</p>
