      <p>As a standard action, you can command a creature within 30 feet to
      refrain from committing a particular action (including any referenced in
      the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.mmdypasgl5us00wb]{Forbid Action}). If the
      creature performs the named action before the beginning of your next turn,
      it takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every 2 cleric levels you
      possess and the effect ends. This is a language-dependent effect. You can
      use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.<p>If you have the spell rune domain power, you can attach a
      spell effect to the prohibition as if it were the spell rune domain
      ability; the spell takes effect if the creature performs the named action.
      This spell must be of at least 1 level lower than the highest-level cleric
      spell you can cast, and it must target one or more creatures. Regardless
      of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it affects only
      the creature that triggers the rune. Attaching a spell in this way extends
      the duration of the prohibition by a number of rounds equal to the spellâ€™s
      level, or until it is discharged.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Touch of Law power of the Law Domain or the
      Blast Rune power of the Rune Domain.</p>
