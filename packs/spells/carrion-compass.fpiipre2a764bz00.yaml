      <p>You animate one of the target's fetid organs so that it leads you to
      the undead creature's most recent controller or the cause of the
      creature's undeath.</p><p>The organ (typically the heart, the brain, or an
      eyeball) floats in front of you at chest level and slowly leads you to the
      undead creature's most recent controller at a rate of 30 feet per round,
      always staying within your range of vision. If the creature from which the
      organ originated had no controller, but rather was created deliberately by
      another creature, the organ instead leads you to that creator.</p><p>If
      the undead was animated by an effect or event at a particular location,
      the organ leads you to that location.</p><p>If the creature was animated
      by none of the methods above, if it was self-created, or if the creature's
      most recent controller no longer exists, the spell fails. Once the organ
      is within 10 feet of its intended destination, the spell ends, and the
      organ falls to the ground.</p><p>The organ cannot engage in combat or
      execute any other task aside from leading you to its intended target. It
      may pass through small slits and crevices, though it will not leave your
      range of vision. The organ cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot
      where you cast the spell. If the undead creature to which the organ
      belonged is destroyed, the spell ends and the organ falls to the
      ground.</p>
