Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature were two sizes larger than it actually is (see page 302 of the <i>Pathfinder Bestiary</i> for more information). If the creature is already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt by each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually change the creature's size; all of its statistics except the amount of damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged.</p>",
