By spending 1 minute setting the cast and waiting for it to dry, you can copy footprints, allowing others to examine them without traveling to the scene, and preventing the DC of the <em>Survival</em> check to analyze them from increasing because of time or weather. <b>Price</b> 2 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1129</em></p>\r\n"
