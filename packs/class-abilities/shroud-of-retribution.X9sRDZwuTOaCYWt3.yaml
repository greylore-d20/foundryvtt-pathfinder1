  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As an immediate action, you can summon a shroud of spirits that
      reflects your attackersâ€™ damage back onto them. Any creature that strikes
      you deals normal damage to you, but at the same time the attacker takes
      1d8 points of force damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels you possess
      (maximum +10). This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
      at 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>
