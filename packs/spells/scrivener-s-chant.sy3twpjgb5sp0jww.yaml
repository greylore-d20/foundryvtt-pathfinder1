  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell imbues a quill with animate energy and rapidly transcribes
    words from one page to another. The quill copies a written work at the rate
    of one normal-sized page per minute.</p><p>The Linguistics skill can be used
    to make a convincing copy, but otherwise the reproduction is written in the
    hand of the caster.</p><p>You must concentrate upon the material being
    duplicated for the spell's duration and provide new blank pages as
    required.</p><p>The <i>scrivener's chant</i> requires blank paper and a
    quill or other writing materials, in addition to the material
    components.</p><p>This spell cannot duplicate magical writing (including
    spells and magical scrolls), though it can duplicate non-magical writing
    from a magical source.</p>
