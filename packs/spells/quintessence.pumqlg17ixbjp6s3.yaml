      <p>You draw forth the idealized image of the target creature or object,
      masking any flaws or damage. An injured or ill creature appears healthy,
      and a damaged object or one with the broken condition appears intact.
      However, a corpse  masked by <i>quintessence</i> remains obviously dead,
      and a completely destroyed object can't be made to seem whole. This
      illusion has visual and tactile components. Careful examination of or
      handling the target grants a saving throw to disbelieve, but casual
      observation does not. Using a broken object for its intended purpose
      automatically reveals the deception. Appraise checks to assess the value
      of an object affected by <i>quintessence</i> estimate the value as an item
      of its type in perfect condition, unless the appraiser disbelieves the
      illusion.  Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them with
      successful Will saves or with spell resistance. Those who interact with
      the target can attempt Will saves to see through the glamer, but spell
      resistance doesn't apply. <i>Quintessence</i> counters and dispels
      <i>decrepit disguise</i>.</p>
