  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian grows a pair of large horns, gaining a gore
      attack. This attack is a primary attack (unless she is also attacking with
      weapons, in which case it is a secondary attack) and is made at the
      barbarian’s full base attack bonus (–5 if it is a secondary attack). The
      gore attack deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (1d6 if Small) plus the
      barbarian’s Strength modifier (1/2 if it is a secondary attack).</p>
