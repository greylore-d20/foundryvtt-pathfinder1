      disposable</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Ion tape is a ribbon of material
      tightly wound around a spindle. A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a
      hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet
      of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. When
      wrapped around an object, it has a weak adhesive that keeps it in place.
      When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a
      jolt from a zip stick), the tape bonds together into a single mass of
      plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 30 hit points. When used to
      bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful
      DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source
      causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon condition, at which point
      it can be torn free easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of
      weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip
      can support up to 300 pounds of weight. The uses for ion tape are many-it
      can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes,
      bind prisoners, and so
      on.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 14;
