      disposable</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Goo tubes are a form of preserved
      food. A single goo tube is a malleable cylinder with a cap on one end;
      when it's opened and squeezed, the colorful, goopy contents are extruded.
      Although the texture and appearance of this goo is unappetizing, the paste
      is actually quite tasty, and comes in a mind-boggling assortment of
      flavors. A symbol on the side of the tube often grants a clue as to what
      flavor may be contained within, but these symbols can sometimes be
      counter-intuitive. The contents of a single goo tube can provide
      nourishment for a day for one Medium-size
      creature.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 14;
