  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can loose a deafening blast of sonic energy by expending 1
      point from her arcane reservoir and succeeding at a ranged touch attack
      against any one target within 30 feet. The blast deals an amount of sonic
      damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier, plus an additional
      1d6 points of sonic damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of
      10d6 at 19th level). The target is also deafened for 1 minute. The target
      can attempt a Fortitude save to halve the damage and negate the
      deafness.</p>
