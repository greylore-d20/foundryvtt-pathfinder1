      <p>The vivid and thorny dragon rose is admired for its hardiness but is
      difficult to cultivate.</p>

      <p><b>Gather</b> DC 18; <b>Yield</b> 1 dose</p>

      <p><b>Terrain</b> any forests or mountains</p>

      <p><b>Preparation</b> The petals of a dragon rose must be delicately
      removed from the stem and then soaked in a mixture brewed from the flower
      stalk's sap for 2 hours; this requires a successful DC 15 <em>Craft</em>
      (alchemy) check.</p>

      <p><b>Use</b> A dose of prepared dragon rose petals crushed in the hand
      and then smeared on a weapon (this is a <em>standard action</em>) infuses
      the weapon with a <em>magic aura</em>. For 1 hour, the weapon can bypass
      <em>DR</em>/magic, although it doesn't gain any bonus on attack or damage
      rolls.</p>
