  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You must succeed on a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points
      of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit
      points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the
      subject's current hit points + the subject's Constitution score (which is
      enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour
      later.</p>
