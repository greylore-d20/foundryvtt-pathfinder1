    value: >-
      <p>Once per rage, the barbarian can reroll one ability check, skill check,
      or saving throw she just made. She must take the second result, even if
      itâ€™s lower. She must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled
      but before results are revealed.</p><p>A greater blood rage power can be
      taken only by a barbarian of 10th level or higher who already has the
      middle blood rage power.</p>
