  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You remove all ongoing radiation effects, both primary and secondary, on
    a single target if you succeed at a caster level check (DC = the Fortitude
    DC associated with the radiation effect). In addition, you immediately
    restore 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Strength drain
    caused by radiation-this spell cannot restore ability damage or drain caused
    by other sources. When cast on an area, a single casting of <i>remove
    radioactivity</i> removes radiation from a 20-foot-radius area around the
    point you touch. This spell has no power to negate naturally radioactive
    materials, and as long as such materials remain in an area, the radiation
    that was removed may return.</p>
