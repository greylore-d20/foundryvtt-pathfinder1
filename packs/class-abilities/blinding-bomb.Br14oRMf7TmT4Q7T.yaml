  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose for it to detonate
      very brightly. Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are
      blinded for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Creatures in
      the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1
      minute. This is a light effect.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
