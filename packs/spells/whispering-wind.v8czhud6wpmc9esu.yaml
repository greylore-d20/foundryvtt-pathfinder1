    value: >-
      <p>You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The
      <i>whispering wind</i> travels to a specific location within range that is
      familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A
      <i>whispering wind</i> is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it
      reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other
      sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is
      present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.</p><p>You can prepare the
      spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to
      deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the <i>whispering
      wind</i> seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause
      the <i>whispering wind</i> to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as
      quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.</p><p>When the spell reaches its
      objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered.
      As with magic mouth, <i>whispering wind</i> cannot speak verbal
      components, use command words, or activate magical effects.</p>
