    value: >-
      <p>Using the powers of necromancy, you can determine the condition of
      creatures near death within the spell's range. You instantly know whether
      each creature within the area is dead, fragile (alive and wounded, with 3
      or fewer hit points left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit
      points), healthy, undead, or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct).
      <i>Deathwatch</i> sees through any spell or ability that allows creatures
      to feign death.</p>
