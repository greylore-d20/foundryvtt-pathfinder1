    value: >-
      <p>With a thrust of tectonic energy, you split the earth. Each creature
      standing in the area where the fissure opens must succeed at a Reflex
      saving throw to avoid falling into the rift. Those standing adjacent to
      the fissure when it is created must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked
      prone by tremors. This spell is effective only when cast on an area of
      dirt, earth, sand, or stone.</p>
