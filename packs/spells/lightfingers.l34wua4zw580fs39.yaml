  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A flutter of subtle, telekinetic force causes your target to drop a
      single nonmagical carried item weighing no more than 1 pound per caster
      level, such as a coin purse, a key ring, or a loose object in its pocket.
      The target must succeed at a Perception check against the spell's save DC
      to notice the dropped item. You select what item the target drops as long
      as you can see both your target and the item you wish to affect. This use
      of the spell can't cause a target to lose a held item or anything it is
      wearing, including jewelry.  You can instead cast <i>lightfingers</i> to
      attempt a single disarm or stealAPG combat maneuver, using your caster
      level instead of your base attack bonus, and using your Charisma,
      Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier, whichever is highest, instead of your
      Strength modifier. This disarm or steal attempt does not provoke attacks
      of opportunity and cannot be affected by feats or other means of altering
      a combat maneuver's effects. This use of the spell is immediately
      obvious.</p>
