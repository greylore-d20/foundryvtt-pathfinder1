      "value": "<p>A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can worsen the attitude of a character toward any governmental officer or leader acting against your religion. This likewise reduces that officer’s or leader’s influence with that character. The persuasion requires enough conversation to attempt a Diplomacy check (usually 1 minute) and you attempt a Diplomacy check as normal to influence the target’s attitude. However, if you fail the check, the target is subject to a mind-affecting compulsion that alters its attitude for a number of days equal to your inquisitor level. The target can resist the compulsion with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your inquisitor level + your Wisdom modifier). If the target is under a mind-affecting effect from that officer or leader, the effect is automatically suppressed for 1 minute.</p>"
