  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman gains a swim speed equal to her base land speed, as well as
      the ability to breathe underwater. In addition, she can unleash a torrent
      of ice and water from her hands in a 15-foot cone as a standard action.
      This torrent deals 1d4 points of cold damage per 2 shaman level she
      possesses, and pushes affected creatures back 5 feet directly away from
      the shaman.</p>

      <p>A successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage and negates the
      push.</p>

      <p>The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait
      1d4 rounds between each use.</p>
