      <p>A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite
      ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to
      hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and
      can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20
      pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to
      8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack
      always weighs only 5 pounds. While such storage is useful enough, the pack
      has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific
      item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is
      ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific
      item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the
      attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually
      does.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong>
