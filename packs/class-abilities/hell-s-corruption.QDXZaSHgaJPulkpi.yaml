  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can cause a creature to become more susceptible to corruption as a
      melee touch attack. Creatures touched take a â€“2 penalty on all saving
      throws and must roll all opposed skill checks twice, taking the worse
      result. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric
      level (minimum 1). You can use this ability for a number of times per day
      equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Touch of Evil power of the Evil Domain.</p>
