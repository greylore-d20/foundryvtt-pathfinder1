      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes<p>An endless variety of beings exist
      within and below the Pyramid of Kamaria. Among the most unique denizens of
      the pyramid, however, are the dream eaters. Created by the Gem of Dreams
      (see page 43), these onetime humans have been warped by nightmares into
      deformed creatures. The Rovagug cultists themselves have built a strange
      mythology for themselves around this practice—they believe the Gem of
      Dreams to be a gift sent them by their god. According to their myths, once
      the Rough Beast emerges from the Dead Vault and destroys Golarion, the
      corpse world left behind would be populated only by those Rovagug has
      chosen for survival. It is through this magical gem’s capacity to
      transform dreamers into monsters that they believe they are being so
      selected.<p>“Dream Eater” is an acquired template that can be added to any
      living intelligent creature through contact with the artifact known as the
      Gem of Dreams—but once a creature becomes a dream eater, it cannot gain
      this template again. CR: Same as base creature +2.

      <p><b>CR:</b> Same as base creature +2.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment:</b> Chaotic evil—most dream eaters become worshipers of
      Rovagug, demon lords, or other chaotic evil deities.</p>

      <p><b>Senses:</b> The base creature gains darkvision 60 ft.; if the base
      creature already possesses darkvision, the range of that ability increases
      by 60 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Immunity:</b> The base creature becomes immune to mind-affecting
      effects.</p>

      <p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A dream eater gains two special attacks, as
      detailed below. Both of these special attacks have save DCs equal to 10 +
      1/2 the dream eater’s Hit Dice + the dream eater’s Charisma modifier.</p>

      <p><em>Dream Eating (Su): </em>As a full-round action that provokes
      attacks of opportunity, a dream eater can consume a creature’s
      subconscious dreams if the victim fails to resist with a Will save. A
      sleeping victim takes a –2 penalty on saving throws against this ability,
      but automatically wakens if the save is successful. On a failed save, the
      victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage, and the dream eater gains a
      number of psychic points equal to the Charisma drained, to a maximum
      amount of psychic points equal to the dream eater’s Hit Dice.</p>

      <p><em>Psychic Assault (Su): </em>As a swift action, a dream eater can
      imbue any melee attack he makes with a psychic assault, infusing the mind
      of the creature struck with hideous nightmare visions and hallucinations.
      The magnitude of the effect depends on how many psychic points the dream
      eater spends in the assault. By expending 1 point, the dream eater can
      cause the victim to become dazzled for 1d6 rounds. By expending 3 points,
      he can make a victim become staggered for 1d6 rounds. By expending 5
      points, he can make the victim nauseated for 1d6 rounds. By expending 7
      points, he can make the victim confused for 1d6 rounds. And by expending 9
      points, he can stun the victim for 1d6 rounds. The victim can resist the
      psychic assault entirely by making a Will saving throw.</p>

      <p><b>Special Abilities:</b> A dream eater gains telepathy with other
      dream eaters to a range of 30 feet.</p>

      <p><b>Ability Scores:</b> Str +6, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha
      +4.</p>

      <p><b>Skills:</b> A dream eater gains a +4 racial bonus on Perception and
      Stealth checks. He also gains a +8 racial bonus on Knowledge (religion)
      and Knowledge (planes) checks, and these two skills are now always
      considered class skills for the creature.</p>
