    value: >-
      <p>You overstimulate the target with alternating flashes of light and
      shadow within its eyes, causing its pupils to rapidly dilate and contract.
      While under the effects of this spell, the target is racked by splitting
      headaches and unable to see clearly, becoming nauseated for the spell's
      duration. Each round, the target's pupils randomly become dilated or
      contracted for 1 round. During any round that its eyes are dilated, the
      target is blinded if exposed to bright light or dazzled if exposed to
      normal light. During any round its eyes are contracted, the target is
      blinded if exposed to darkness  or dazzled if exposed to dim light. In
      addition, any creature can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from
      the target, even if the creature lacks cover or concealment.</p>
