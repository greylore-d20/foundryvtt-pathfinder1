      <p>Category Alchemical Weapons</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Holy water
      damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A
      flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.</p><p>Treat this
      attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask
      breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it
      against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy
      water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature
      with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch
      attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>A direct hit by
      a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or
      an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the
      flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.</p><p>Temples to good
      deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit). Holy water is made
      using the @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.cyzbticmitktat5v]{bless water}
      spell.</p>
