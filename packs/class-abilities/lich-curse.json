Normally, one must expend years and tens of thousands of gold pieces to research this deeply personalized method of attaining immortality. Yet, in a rare few cases, chance and ill fortune can conspire against an unsuspecting spellcaster. You have unknowingly) fulfilled most (but not all) of the ritualistic components to achieve lichdom. You have yet to turn into an undead creature, but you are close. You take damage from positive energy and heal from negative energy as if you were undead.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.wkp8u7xl1dgpk362]{Control Undead} to your list of 2nd-level oracle spells known.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, add @Compendium[pf1.spells.atml1a51o9w777w7]{Undead Anatomy I} to your list of 3rd-level oracle spells known and @Compendium[pf1.spells.joj6h1croepb9itx]{Undead Anatomy II} to your list of 5th-level oracle spells known.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you are immune to death effects.</p>"
