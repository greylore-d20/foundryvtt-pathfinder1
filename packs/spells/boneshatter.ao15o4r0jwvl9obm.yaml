  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target's bones (or exoskeleton) splinter, dealing 1d6 points of
    damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to the target, which is also
    exhausted for 1 minute per caster level from the pain and exertion of the
    transformation.  If the target succeeds at its save, it takes half damage
    and is fatigued rather than exhausted. Objects made of bone, chitin, or
    similar material take half again as much damage (+50%) from this spell. This
    spell has no effect on a creature that has neither a skeleton nor a hard
    carapace.</p>
