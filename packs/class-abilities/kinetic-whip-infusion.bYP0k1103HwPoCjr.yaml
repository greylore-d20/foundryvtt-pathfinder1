      <p>You form a long tendril of energy or elemental matter. This functions
      as kinetic blade but counts as a reach weapon appropriate for your size.
      Unlike most reach weapons, the kinetic whip can also attack nearby
      creatures.</p>

      <p>The kinetic whip disappears at the beginning of your next turn, but in
      the intervening time, it threatens all squares within its reach, allowing
      you to make attacks of opportunity that deal the whipâ€™s usual damage.</p>
