    value: >-
      <p>The effects of the alchemistâ€™s change alignment infusion become
      permanent and can only be reversed by
      a@Compendium[pf1.spells.nnj51dwfkwd15ngj]{Wish} or
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.suel7sgnztenv551]{Miracle}. A permanent, forced
      change of alignment may be devastating, and some believe it is little
      better than zealous slavery or mind control. Others consider a good
      alignment brought about by any means but purity of heart an affront to
      freedom. This discovery remains controversial at best.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must take the change alignment discovery and the infusion
      discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>
