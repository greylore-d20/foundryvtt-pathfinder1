If you use this ability while on the&nbsp;<em>Astral Plane</em>&nbsp;or on any plane whose enhanced magic trait allows you to cast a spell as if&nbsp;<em>augmented</em>&nbsp;by @Compendium[pf1.feats.wFoLrh5FeeqBXsQ8]{Quicken Spell}, you can instead choose to augment the spell as though you had applied the @Compendium[pf1.feats.77gXSucrxfrE9yWk]{Empower Spell}&nbsp;or @Compendium[pf1.feats.J1yi4hFKYdXqZE3h]{Maximize Spell}&nbsp;<em>metamagic feats</em>&nbsp;instead.</p>"
