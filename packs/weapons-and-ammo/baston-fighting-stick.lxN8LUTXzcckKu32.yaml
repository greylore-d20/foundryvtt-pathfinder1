  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These weapons are treated sticks of wood, either left bare or covered
      in elaborate decorative designs. Baston fighting sticks vary in length
      from 2 to 4 feet, with thicknesses varying between 1 to 3 inches. In most
      applications, these weapons are similar to clubs or quarterstaffs, but in
      the hands of a trained expert, they truly shine. A creature with the
      Combat Reflexes feat treats the weapon as having the blocking and
      performance weapon special features (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate
      Equipment</em> 22).</p>
