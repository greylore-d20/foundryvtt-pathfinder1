  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This pair of hammers is linked by a loose chain. While the two hammers
      are balanced to wield in melee together, the chain is long enough that you
      can throw one hammer a short distance and then pull it back; pulling the
      chain to retrieve the thrown hammer is a move action. The chain-hammer's
      maximum throwing range is 10 feet. Dwarf rangers are fond of using
      chain-hammers, often using a locked gauntlet to make sure one of the
      hammers remains secure.</p>
