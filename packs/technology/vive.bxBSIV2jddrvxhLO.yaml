      <p>Vive revitalizes the body at the cost of mental acuity. This
      pharmaceutical has an onset time of 1 minute. It eliminates fatigue and
      exhaustion and heals 1d4 points of ability damage to a physical ability
      score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) of the target's choice. The
      first dose taken in a 24-hour period deals 1d2 points of ability damage to
      Intelligence and Wisdom; additional doses in that period deal 1d4 points
      of ability damage instead. Vive can be resisted with a successful DC 12
      Fortitude saving throw.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong>
