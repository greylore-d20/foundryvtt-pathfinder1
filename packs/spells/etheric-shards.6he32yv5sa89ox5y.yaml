    value: >-
      <p>You harden interpenetrated ethereal substance into deadly
      transdimensional razors that are invisible to normal sight. Movement
      through an area of <i>etheric shards</i> is halved, even for incorporeal
      creatures, and creatures entering a 5-foot cube filled with <i>etheric
      shards</i> take 1d8 points of piercing and slashing damage and must
      succeed at a Reflex save or take 1 point of bleed damage. This bleed
      damage stacks with itself and other sources of bleed damage. A creature
      standing within an area of <i>etheric shards</i> takes no damage as long
      as it remains completely motionless, but even the minor movements involved
      in attacking or defending in combat force a stationary creature to attempt
      a Reflex save. If a stationary creature succeeds at this save, it avoids
      damage completely for that round, but if it fails, it takes hit point
      damage and bleed damage as though it had moved through the square.  A
      creature forcibly moved through an area of <i>etheric shards</i>, such as
      by a bull rush or drag combat maneuver, takes a -4 penalty on its saving
      throw, but a creature able to see invisible or ethereal objects gains a +4
      bonus, and damage to it is completely negated on a successful Reflex save.
      <i>Etheric shards</i> are considered a magical trap, and a creature with
      trapfinding can use Perception to find them. The DC of this check is equal
      to 25 + the spell's level. <i>Etheric shards</i> can't be disabled with
      the Disable Device skill.</p>
