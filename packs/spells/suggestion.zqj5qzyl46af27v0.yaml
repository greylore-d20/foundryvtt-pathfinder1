      <p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course
      of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The <i>suggestion</i> must be
      worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking
      the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the
      effect of the spell.</p><p>The suggested course of activity can continue
      for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a
      shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked
      to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special
      activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell
      duration expires, the activity is not performed.</p><p>A very reasonable
      <i>suggestion</i> causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or
      -2).</p>
