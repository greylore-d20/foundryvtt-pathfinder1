    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.ugQyUpqPBDsqLyra]{Spring
      Attack} as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. At 10th level and
      every 4 levels thereafter, the vigilante can designate one additional
      creature when he uses Spring Attack. The  vigilanteâ€™s movement this round
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity from any of these secondary
      creatures.</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</p>
