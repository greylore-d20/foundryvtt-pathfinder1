  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an outsider
      (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice. If you serve no particular deity,
      the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your
      philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you
      may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though
      you might get a different creature anyway).</p><p>You may ask the creature
      to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range
      from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the
      creature called in order to bargain for its services.</p><p>The creature
      called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a
      variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple,
      to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your
      part that matches the creature's alignment and goals.</p><p>Regardless,
      this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any
      services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the
      creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p><p>A task taking up to 1
      minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the
      creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the
      creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one
      requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per
      HD.</p><p>A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment,
      while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if
      any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called
      creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature).
      However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may
      halve or even waive the payment.</p><p>At the end of its task, or when the
      duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane
      (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and
      possible).</p><p><i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell that calls an
      air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a
      spell of that type.</p>
