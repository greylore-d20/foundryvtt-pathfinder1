  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 12th level, whenever a samurai declares a challenge, his target must
      pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the
      threatened area of the samurai, it takes a â€“2 penalty to its AC on attacks
      made by anyone other than the samurai.</p>
