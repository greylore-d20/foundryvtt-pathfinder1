In such an area, it automatically defaults to the ambient natural light level, and then reduces it one step.</p>\r\n<p class=\"source\">[<a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj/faq#35v5748eaic9ne9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source</a>]</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1110</em></p>\r\n<p>This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck as a <em>standard action</em>. It sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A sunrod does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.</p>\r\n<p>The <em>Equipment Trick</em> feat provides a number of options for using this item in combat.</p>\r\n"
