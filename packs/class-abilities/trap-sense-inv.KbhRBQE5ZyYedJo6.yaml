    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him
      to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on <em>Reflex</em> saving
      throws to avoid traps and a +1 <em>dodge bonus</em> to AC against attacks
      by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses
      increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p>
