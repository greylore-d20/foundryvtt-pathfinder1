      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can surround yourself with a 10-foot-radius cloud of ash, which functions as an&nbsp;obscuring mist&nbsp;spell, except you can see through it clearly. The cloud is stationary, and remains for 1 round per oracle level. Using this ability again causes your previous cloud to fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, your ash cloud fills with embers. All creatures in the cloud except you take 1d6 points of fire damage per round and must succeed at Fortitude saves to avoid choking, as though they were breathing in heavy smoke (Core Rulebook&nbsp;444).</p>"
