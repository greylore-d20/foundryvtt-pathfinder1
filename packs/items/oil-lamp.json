You can also use a flask of lamp oil as a <em>splash weapon</em>. Use the rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a <em>full-round action</em> to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.</p>\n<p>You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.</p>"
