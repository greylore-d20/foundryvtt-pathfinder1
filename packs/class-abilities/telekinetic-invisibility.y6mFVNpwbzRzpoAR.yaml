      <p><b>Element</b> aether; <b>Type</b> utility (Sp); <b>Level</b> 3;
      <b>Burn</b> 0</p>

      <p>You weave strands of aether, bending light and dampening sound; this
      works as invisibility except that the aetheric bending is easier to notice
      than normal invisibility, so your bonus on Stealth checks is halved (+10
      while moving and +20 while perfectly still). However, the dampened sound
      allows you to avoid automatic detection via sound-based blindsense and
      blindsight, but you do not receive the bonus on Stealth checks from this
      wild talent against a creature with such abilities.</p>
