    value: >-
      <p>While subject to this spell, the targets find that forested areas
      become helpful instead of hindering. The targets suffer no hindrances to
      movement and suffer no penalties on Acrobatics and Stealth checks from
      undergrowth in forested terrain. Furthermore, forested overgrowth imposes
      a miss chance 10% lower than normal. When moving in and among trees, those
      subject to the spell gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks and
      Climb checks. Rangers in their favored terrain can also add their favored
      terrain bonus on such Acrobatics and Climb checks.</p>
