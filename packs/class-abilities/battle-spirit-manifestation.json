      "value": "<p>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of battle. As a full-round action, she can make a full attack and move up to her speed (either before or after the attacks). Whenever she scores a critical hit, the attack ignores damage reduction. She gains a +4 insight bonus to AC for the purposes of confirming critical hits against her. If she is reduced to below 0 hit points, she does not die until her negative hit point total exceeds double her Constitution score.</p>"
