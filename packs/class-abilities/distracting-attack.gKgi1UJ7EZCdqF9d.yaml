  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this talent can make sneak attacks with subtle
      flourishes that disorient and distract her enemy. When she hits a creature
      with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo the
      additional damage to cause the creature to become flat-footed against one
      target of her choosing until the beginning of her next turn. The character
      cannot designate herself as the creature gaining the benefit of this
      talent. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to distracting attack.</p>
