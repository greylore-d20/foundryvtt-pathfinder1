  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The target creature becomes stronger, hardier, and imbued with the
    courage of the greatest megafauna of the tundra. The spell grants a +8
    enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, immunity to fear, a +4
    morale bonus to Will saves, and doubles the critical threat range of all its
    attacks against creatures of the dragon type (this does not stack with
    Improved Critical, <i>keen edge</i>, or similar effects).</p>
