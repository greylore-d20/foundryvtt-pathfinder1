  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The ground attempts to pull creatures beneath its surface as if hungry
      for the flesh of mortals.  Immediately, and at the beginning of each of
      your turns, every creature touching the ground within the area of the
      spell is the target of a grapple combat maneuver. Creatures that enter the
      area of effect are also automatically attacked. The ground does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity. The earth's CMB is equal to 5 + your
      caster level for the purpose of this combat maneuver check. Attempt the
      combat maneuver check only once each round and apply the result to all
      creatures in the area of effect.  Each time the ground succeeds at a
      combat maneuver check to grapple a foe, it drags the creature farther
      down, eventually forcing the creature below its surface. With the first
      successful check, the target gains the grappled condition. Grappled
      opponents can't move without first breaking the grapple (doing so requires
      a successful DC 20 combat maneuver or Escape Artist check). The ground
      receives a +5 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple opponents it is
      already grappling. After the second successful grapple combat maneuver
      check, the grappled creature is pulled to the ground and becomes prone. On
      the third successful grapple combat maneuver check, the creature is fully
      buried and must hold its breath or begin suffocating.  A buried creature
      can't attempt to escape unless the effect ends or it breaks the grapple.
      The DC to escape the grapple increases to 25 for a creature that has been
      pulled beneath the earth.</p>
