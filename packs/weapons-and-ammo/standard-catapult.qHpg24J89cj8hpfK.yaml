      Engine</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Catapults are stone-throwing siege
      engines powered by winched arms that run through torsion skeins, and hold
      their payload in a cup that swings up and over the weapon when released.
      Catapults can hurl a variety of different types of ammunition (the damage
      given is for stone projectiles; other types of ammunition can be found
      later in this chapter). They are indirect-fire siege
      engines.</p><p><em>Light</em>: These catapults are Large and often mounted
      on wheels. The targeting DC of a light catapult is 15. Light catapults
      have a hardness of 5 and 50 hit points. Light catapult stones cost 10 gp
      and weigh 50 pounds each. <em>Standard</em>: These Huge siege engines are
      too large to be transported to the battlefield in one piece, and require
      assembly. They typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target
      (targeting DC 20). Standard catapults have a hardness of 5 and 100 hit
      points. Standard catapult stones cost 15 gp and weigh 75 pounds each.
      <em>Heavy</em>: These Gargantuan siege engines are too large to be
      transported to the battlefield in one piece, and require assembly. They
      typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 25).
      Heavy catapults have a hardness of 5 and 200 hit points. Heavy catapult
      stones cost 25 gp and weigh 90 pounds each.</p>
