    value: >-
      <p>The witch fills an ally with the safety he feels at home or inflicts
      pangs of homesickness to hamper an enemy’s defenses. She chooses a target
      for the hex within 30 feet. If she chooses an ally, that ally gains a +2
      dodge bonus to AC against traps and on Reflex saves against traps. If she
      chooses an opponent, that opponent takes a –2 penalty to AC against traps
      and on Reflex saves against traps. Either way, the effects last for 1
      minute. The target can attempt a Will save to negate the effects of the
      hex.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 4.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 6.</p>

      <p>A creature targeted by this hex cannot be targeted again by this hex
      for 1 day.</p>
