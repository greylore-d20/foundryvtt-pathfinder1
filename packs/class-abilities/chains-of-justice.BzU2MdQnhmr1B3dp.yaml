  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, once per day, you can bind an opponent within 60 feet to
      you with spectral chains (Will negates). When you take damage from an
      enemy, the bound target takes this damage as well. Whenever the bound
      target takes damage from you or one of your allies, you take this damage
      as well. You and the target are not physically bound to each other, and
      either can end the connection by breaking the line of effect or exceeding
      the ability's range. You may dismiss the chains as a standard action.</p>
