      roller nearly 10 feet wide. Handles or a harness project from the axle,
      allowing four orcs or one Large beast to push the crushing wheel from
      behind. As a full-round action, its crew can roll the crushing wheel over
      creatures in front of it. This functions as the trample monster ability
      except as noted here. Creatures that are overrun fall prone and take 4d6
      points of damage. Targets that succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw take
      only half damage and avoid falling prone. A crushing wheel has a hardness
      of 10 and 100 hit points.</p><p>A crushing wheel is a Large siege
      engine.</p>
