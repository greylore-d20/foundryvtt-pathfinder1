  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, an inquisitor can use mental and physical resiliency to
      avoid certain attacks. If she makes a Fortitude or Will saving throw
      against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she
      instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can only be used if the
      inquisitor is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless
      inquisitor does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>
