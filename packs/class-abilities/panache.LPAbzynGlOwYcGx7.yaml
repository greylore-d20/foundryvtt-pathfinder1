    value: >-
      <p>More than just a lightly armored warrior, a swashbuckler is a daring
      combatant. She fights with panache: a fluctuating measure of a
      swashbuckler’s ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start
      of each day, a swashbuckler gains a number of panache points equal to her
      Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Her panache goes up or down throughout the
      day, but usually cannot go higher than her Charisma modifier (minimum 1),
      though feats and magic items can affect this maximum. A swashbuckler
      spends panache to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains panache in the
      following ways.<p><em>Critical Hit with a Light or One-Handed Piercing
      Melee Weapon: </em>Each time the swashbuckler confirms a critical hit with
      a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she regains 1 panache point.
      Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or a creature
      that has fewer Hit Dice than half the swashbuckler’s character level
      doesn’t restore panache.<p><em>Killing Blow with a Light or One-Handed
      Piercing Melee Weapon: </em>When the swashbuckler reduces a creature to 0
      or fewer hit points with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon
      attack while in combat, she regains 1 panache point. Destroying an
      unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer
      hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the
      swashbuckler’s character level to 0 or fewer hit points doesn’t restore
      any panache.</p>
