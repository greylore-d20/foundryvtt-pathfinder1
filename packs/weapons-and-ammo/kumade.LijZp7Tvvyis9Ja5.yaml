  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Adapted from a garden rake, the kumade consists of a wood or bamboo
      pole topped with a metal claw. The rake head doubles as a grappling hook.
      When a kumade is secured to a surface, such as a rafter or window sill,
      its handle can be climbed as a 5-foot length of rope.</p>
