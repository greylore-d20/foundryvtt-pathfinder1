          <p>This type includes insects, arachnids, other arthropods, worms, and
          similar invertebrates.</p>

          <h2>Features</h2>

          <p>Vermin have the following features.</p>

          <ul>

          <li>d8 Hit Die.</li>

          <li>Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (medium
          progression).</li>

          <li>Good <em>Fortitude</em> saves.</li>

          <li>Skill points equal to 2 + Int modifier (minimum 1) per Hit Die.
          Most vermin, however, are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.
          Vermin have no class skills.</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>Traits</h2>

          <p>Vermin possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a
          creature’s entry).</p>

          <ul>

          mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns,
          and phantasms). A vermin-like creature with an <em>Intelligence</em>
          score is usually either an animal or a magical beast, depending on its
          other abilities.</li>

          <li><em>Darkvision</em> 60 feet.</li>

          <li>Proficient with its natural weapons only.</li>

          <p>A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so
          it is not subject to <em>critical hits</em> or <em>flanking</em>. A
          swarm made up of <em>Tiny</em> creatures takes half damage from
          <em>slashing</em> and <em>piercing</em> weapons. A swarm composed of
          <em>Fine</em> or <em>Diminutive</em> creatures is immune to all weapon
          damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or less causes it to break
          up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability
          to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never
          @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.JournalEntry.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.TTp8q9Vb2PNAujWu]{staggered}
          or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be
          <em>tripped</em>,
          @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.JournalEntry.NSqfXaj4MevUR2uJ.JournalEntryPage.i4gHNAVajJWs4cFI]{grappled},
          or <em>bull rushed</em>, and they cannot <em>grapple</em> an
          opponent.</p><p>A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets
          a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as
          disintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms,
          compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms) if the swarm has
          an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as
          much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as
          splash weapons and many evocation spells.</p><p>Swarms made up of
          <em>Diminutive</em> or <em>Fine</em> creatures are susceptible to high
          winds, such as those created by a gust of wind spell. For purposes of
          determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a
          creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm
          rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized
          and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its
          nonlethal damage.</p>

      description:
        value: >-
          <p>Creatures with the swarm subtype don't make standard melee attacks.
          Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they
          occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm
          attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A
          swarm's statistics block has "swarm" in the Melee entries, with no
          attack bonus given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its
          Hit Dice, as shown below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Swarm
          HD</th><th>Swarm Base
          Damage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>1d6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6-10</p></td><td><p>2d6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11-15</p></td><td><p>3d6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16-20</p></td><td><p>4d6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>21
          or more</p></td><td><p>5d6</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A swarm's
          attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm's description states
          otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack's
          damage to 0, being incorporeal, or other special abilities usually
          give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to damage from a
          swarm. Some swarms also have acid, blood drain, poison, or other
          special attacks in addition to normal damage.</p><p>Swarms do not
          threaten creatures, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their
          swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy,
          as described below.</p><p>Swarms possess the
          @UUID[Compendium.pf1.monster-abilities.Item.WMwjQfyTC5BCoZlf]{distraction}
          universal monster rule. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within
          the area of a swarm requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell
          level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires
          a DC 20 Will save.</p>
