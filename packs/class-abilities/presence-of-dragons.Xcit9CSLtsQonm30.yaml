      <p>Those who would oppose you must overcome their fear of dragons or be
      struck with terror at your draconic majesty. As a swift action, you can
      manifest an aura of draconic might around yourself. Enemies within 30 feet
      who can see you when you activate this ability must attempt a Will save.
      Success means that the creature is immune to this ability for the
      following 24 hours. On a failed save, the opponent is shaken for 2d6
      rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p>You can use this
      ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th
      level and for every 5 levels beyond 5th.</p>
