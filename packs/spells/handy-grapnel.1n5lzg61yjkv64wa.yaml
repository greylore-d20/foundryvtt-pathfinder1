    value: >-
      <p>You cause the target rope to shrink and reshape itself into an arrow,
      bolt, or similar piece of ammunition, which you can shoot at any Medium or
      larger object. With a successful attack roll against an AC equal to 5 plus
      the hardness of the target object, the <i>handy grapnel</i> strikes and
      embeds itself in that object with the strength of an iron grappling hook. 
      As a move action, you can command the rope to extend from the arrow. If
      you are within a distance equal to the length of the rope and have a hand
      free, the end of the rope swings directly into your hand. With another
      move action, you can command the <i>handy grapnel</i> to retract itself up
      to the grappling hook, pulling up any creature or object supported by the
      rope at a speed of 50 feet per round.  Once embedded, the rope can be used
      for climbing or any other purpose a rope could serve, and it can bear up
      to 200 pounds per level of the caster at a time (maximum 1,000 pounds). If
      this weight limit is exceeded, the <i>handy grapnel</i> comes loose and
      any creature or object supported by the rope falls.</p>
