    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you can rally your allies to fight together. For 1
      minute, whenever you make a successful melee or ranged attack against a
      foe, allies within 10 feet of you gain a +2 insight bonus on attacks of
      the same type you made against that foeâ€”melee attacks if you made a melee
      attack, or ranged attacks if you made a ranged attack. If you score a
      critical hit, this bonus increases to +4 until the start of your next
      turn.</p>
