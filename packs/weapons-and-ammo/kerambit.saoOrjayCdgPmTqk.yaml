  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This small, curved pull dagger has a metal loop at the base of its
      handle, allowing it to be secured with a pinky or worn on a string tied in
      the hair. While relatively small, the curved blade can create brutal
      wounds. Easily concealed (you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks
      made to conceal a kerambit on your body), it is a favorite weapon of ninja
      and assassins.</p>
