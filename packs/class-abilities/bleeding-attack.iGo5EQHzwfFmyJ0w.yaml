  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A character with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by
      hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1
      additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue's sneak
      attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that
      amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The
      bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any
      effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does
      not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any damage reduction the
      creature might possess.</p>
