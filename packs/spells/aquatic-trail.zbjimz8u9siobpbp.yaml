  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You use divination magic to enhance the underwater trails in the area
    around you, allowing you to track creatures through the water as if across
    soft ground as long as they passed through the area less than 1 week ago
    (this lets you notice trails that are much older than normal underwater
    trails). The spell's area moves with you, so you can follow the trail
    through the water over long distances. Other creatures can also follow the
    trail as long as they move with you. Because of the plethora of sea
    creatures in the higher zones, it's possible that the trail that most
    interests you will be covered by the trails of other aquatic creatures,
    making this spell even more useful than normal in the Abyssal and Abaddonian
    zones.</p>
