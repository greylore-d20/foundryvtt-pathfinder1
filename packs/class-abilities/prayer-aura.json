      "value": "<p>At 13th level, as a free action, you can extend an aura around you to bolster your allies and make your enemies less effective. You can use this aura for a number of rounds per day equal to your psychic level. These rounds don’t need to be consecutive. This functions as the @Compendium[pf1.spells.hu8179fdqfkl0bqj]{Prayer} spell, granting your allies a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks and imposing a –1 penalty on your enemies’ rolls of those types.</p>\n<p>If you are chaotic, lawful, good, or evil, the penalty from your aura changes to –2 against creatures of an opposing alignment. The penalty doesn’t change further for a creature that opposes you on two alignment axes (such as a chaotic evil creature fighting a lawful good psychic).</p>"
