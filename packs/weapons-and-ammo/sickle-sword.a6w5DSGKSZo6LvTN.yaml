      residents of Irrisen with no talent for witchcraft, this exotic blade
      curves multiple times along its 3-1/2 feet. The sickle-sword's hilt is
      long and curved, and its blade bears a small secondary grip partway up its
      length. These allow a wielder with a free hand to rapidly twist the sword
      in unpredictable ways. When wielding a sickle-sword in one hand and
      nothing in the other, you can spend a swift action to gain a +2 bonus on
      your next attack roll before the end of your turn.</p>
