  description:
    value: >-
      <p>These subtle blades can only be used by catfolk with the cat's claws
      racial trait. Bought in a set of five, they fit over the wearer's claws on
      one hand. The blades grant the wearer a +1 enhancement bonus on claw
      attack rolls with that hand and change the weapon type from a natural
      weapon to a light slashing weapon. Catfolk with the cat's claws racial
      trait are proficient with this weapon. The claw blades can be enhanced
      like a masterwork weapon for the normal costs. The listed cost of the item
      is for one set of five claws for one hand.</p>
