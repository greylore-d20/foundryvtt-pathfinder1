An implementation of the first edition of Pathfinder for Foundry Virtual
Tabletop (http://foundryvtt.com).

## Installation

Install the following game system in FoundryVTT's game system tab:

[https://gitlab.com/foundryvtt_pathfinder1e/foundryvtt-pathfinder1/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/system.json](https://gitlab.com/foundryvtt_pathfinder1e/foundryvtt-pathfinder1/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/system.json)

If you wish to manually install the system, you must extract a built version into the `Data/systems/pf1` folder.
You may do this by downloading a `pf1.zip` archive from the [Releases Page](https://gitlab.com/foundryvtt_pathfinder1e/foundryvtt-pathfinder1/-/releases).
Be careful not to download a source code archive, as those will not work within Foundry.

## Building

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Change directory to the repository root and run `npm ci`.
3. Run `npm run build` to create a `dist` directory containing all files necessary to use the system in Foundry.
   Alternatively, you can run `npm run build:serve` to build the system and start a Vite development server.

For additional information regarding the build process, see the [Setup](CONTRIBUTING.md#setup) section of the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## API

This system provides module and macro developers with an API, including the ability to listen to system-specific hook events and extending the system's functionality.
Its automatically generated documentation can be found in the [API documentation](https://foundryvtt_pathfinder1e.gitlab.io/foundryvtt-pathfinder1/index.html).

## User Documentation

While running the system in Foundry, you can find a Help browser in the Settings tab.
An English mirror of that information can also be found in [this repository's wiki](https://gitlab.com/foundryvtt_pathfinder1e/foundryvtt-pathfinder1/-/wikis/Help/Home) in the `System reference sheet / Help` section.

The rest of [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/foundryvtt_pathfinder1e/foundryvtt-pathfinder1/-/wikis/home) also includes [FAQs](https://gitlab.com/foundryvtt_pathfinder1e/foundryvtt-pathfinder1/-/wikis/FAQs) and some other helpful content.
