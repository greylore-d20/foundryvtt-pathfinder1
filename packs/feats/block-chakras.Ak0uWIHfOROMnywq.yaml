    value: >-
      <p><em>You’ve learned how to block the lower chakras of your
      foes.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Psychic Sensitivity or
      levels in an occult class, brawler’s flurry or flurry of blows class
      feature, ki pool.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action,
      you can spend 1 ki point to make a single unarmed strike that attempts to
      block one of the target’s chakras. If you hit the target and deal damage,
      you can select either the root, sacral, or navel chakra, as long as you
      can open that chakra yourself. The target suffers a specific effect based
      on the chosen chakra (see below), though it can reduce these effects with
      a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + the
      ability modifier you use to calculate your ki pool).</p><ul><li><p>Root:
      The target’s DR is reduced by 10 for 1 minute. If the target has multiple
      forms of DR, you choose which DR is reduced. On a successful save, the
      target’s DR is instead reduced by 5 for 1 round.</p></li><li><p>Sacral:
      The target can’t use any of its speeds except its land speed (or swim
      speed for an aquatic creature) for 1 round, and it moves at half speed for
      1 minute. If it was flying, the target can attempt a Fly check to fall
      safely. On a successful save, the target instead moves at half speed for 1
      round.</p></li><li><p>Navel: The target takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls
      and damage rolls, and it reduces the DCs of its spells and abilities by 2
      for 1 minute. On a successful save, the penalty and reduction is halved
      and lasts for 1 round.</p></li></ul>
