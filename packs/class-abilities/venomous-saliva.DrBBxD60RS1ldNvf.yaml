    value: >-
      <p>Just as certain serpents can spray poison from their fangs, as a swift
      action, you can spit a gout of life-stealing venom onto a weapon you are
      wielding. The poison lasts for 1 minute or until you make an attack with
      that weapon that injures a foe. Life-Stealing Venom: Injury; save Fort DC
      10 + half your class level + your Wisdom modifier; frequency 1/round for 3
      rounds; effect 1 Con damage; cure 1 save. You can use the venomous saliva
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Venomous Stare power of the Scalykind
      Domain.</p>
