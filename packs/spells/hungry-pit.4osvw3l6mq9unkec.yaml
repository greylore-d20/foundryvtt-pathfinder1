  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>create pit</i>, except that the pit has the
    ability to squeeze and crush any creature trapped within it and has a
    maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the hole take falling
    damage as normal. In addition, anyone within the pit, not just those on the
    bottom, takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round as the pit
    contracts and then returns to its normal size (a successful Reflex save
    halves this damage). The ever-shifting walls of the pit are quite difficult
    to scale and have a Climb DC of 35.</p>
