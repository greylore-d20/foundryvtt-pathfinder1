When the trick is triggered, the subject suppresses the fear effect that triggered the trick for 1d4 rounds, and any creature that caused this effect must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 1 round. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering fear effect still count against the effect’s duration.</p>\n<p>If the duration of the reflect fear trick is longer than the fear effect lasts, the subject isn’t affected by the fear effect at all.</p>"
