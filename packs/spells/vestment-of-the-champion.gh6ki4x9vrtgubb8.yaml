      <p>This functions as <i>magic vestment</i>, except it only affects armor
      or a shield you are wearing or carrying. If the armor or shield is worn or
      carried by anyone other than you, the spell has no effect, but resumes its
      effect when you are wearing or carrying it again.</p>
