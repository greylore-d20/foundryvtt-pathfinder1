      "value": "<p>You infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, causing it to separate from your body and act as an independent creature. This ability functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.9u4mn2uxm862cpbb]{Shadow Projection} except as follows. Your shadow has the outsider type and the phantom subtype instead of the undead type. As a result, this ability does not have the evil descriptor and your shadow cannot be turned or affected as undead (though it can be affected as an outsider). You can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to half your oracle level. These hours don’t need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-hour increments. Your shadow’s hit points are not replenished between uses, although your shadow can be healed in the same manner as any other outsider. When this ability isn’t in use, any healing done to you also heals your shadow for an equal amount.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 7th level to choose this revelation.</p>"
