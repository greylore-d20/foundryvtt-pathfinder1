  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You pass judgment on your enemies' intentions and punish them with holy
    power. Each creature in the spell's area takes 1d8 points of damage per
    spell level, determined by the most powerful effect with the evil descriptor
    either affecting that creature or in its spell repertoire. A caster who
    prepares spells takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell he
    prepared that day, even if he already cast that spell. A spontaneous
    spellcaster takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell she
    knows, even if she has no remaining spell slots available to cast that
    spell. A creature with evil spell-like abilities takes this damage based on
    the highest-level evil spell-like ability it can use. A creature who doesn't
    cast spells but is the willing beneficiary of evil spells takes this damage
    based on the highest-level evil spell currently affecting it, including
    spells that affect an area such as <i>desecrate</i>. A creature subject  to
    the harmful effects of an evil spell are unaffected unless it voluntarily
    accepted the spell's effects.</p>
