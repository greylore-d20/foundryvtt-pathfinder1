      <p>Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine. Called
      paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle
      against evil. Knights, crusaders, and law-bringers, paladins seek not just
      to spread divine justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous
      deities they serve. In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to
      ironclad laws of morality and discipline. As reward for their
      righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in
      their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the
      faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with
      the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of
      faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting
      to bring about a brighter future.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: Paladins serve as beacons for their allies within the
      chaos of battle. While deadly opponents of evil, they can also empower
      goodly souls to aid in their crusades. Their magic and martial skills also
      make them well suited to defending others and blessing the fallen with the
      strength to continue fighting.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: Lawful good</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d10</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175 gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>

      <h2>Class Skills</h2>

      <p>The paladin’s class skills are Craft (Int),
      Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha),
      Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nobility)
      (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int),
      Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex),
      Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft
      (Int).</p>
