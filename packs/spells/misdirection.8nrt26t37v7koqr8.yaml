  shortDescription: >-
    <p>By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination
    spells that reveal auras (detect <i>evil, detect magic, discern lies,</i>
    and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range.
    For the duration of the spell, the subject of <i>misdirection is</i>
    detected as if it were the other object. Neither the subject nor the other
    object gets a saving throw against this effect. Detection spells provide
    information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of
    the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save.
    For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within
    range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment,
    and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic
    (augury, <i>detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance,</i> and the
    like).</p>
