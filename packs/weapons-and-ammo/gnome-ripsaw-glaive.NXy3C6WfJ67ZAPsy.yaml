  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The blade of this glaive is serrated and mounted on an axle, around
      which a heavy cord is wrapped. When the cord is pulled as a move action,
      the blade spins rapidly for a number of rounds equal to your Strength
      bonus. While the blade is spinning, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls
      with the weapon. When the blade is not spinning, treat this weapon as a
      glaive.</p>
