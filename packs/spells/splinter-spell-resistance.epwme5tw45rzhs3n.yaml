  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You create an aura around the target weapon that weakens a foe's magical
    defenses. The first time each round the weapon damages a creature with spell
    resistance, that creature's spell resistance is reduced by 5 for 1 round.
    This reduction is not cumulative for multiple attacks within the same round,
    even if the target is struck by different weapons, each affected by a
    different casting of <i>splinter spell resistance</i>. However, the same
    creature's spell resistance can be reduced on multiple rounds by subsequent
    hits.</p>
