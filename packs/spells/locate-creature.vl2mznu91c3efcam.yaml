  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>locate object,</i> except this spell
      locates a known creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in
      the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range.
      You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.</p><p>The
      spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature
      known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind
      of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet)
      at least once.</p><p>Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect
      objects. It can be fooled by <i>mislead, nondetection</i>, and
      <i>polymorph</i> spells.</p>
