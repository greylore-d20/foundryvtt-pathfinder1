  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, an antipaladin's weapons are treated as evil-aligned for
      the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Any attack made against an
      enemy within 10 feet of him is treated as evil-aligned for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while the
      antipaladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
