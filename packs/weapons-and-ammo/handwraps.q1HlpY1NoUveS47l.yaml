  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Many unarmed fighters wrap their hands in cloth to minimize injuries to
      their fists. Some martial artists also weave small coins or metal bars
      into their handwraps, adding special material effects as well. Handwraps
      don't alter the damage a character's unarmed attacks deal. However,
      masterwork handwraps can be enchanted as weapons, providing their benefits
      on unarmed attacks the character makes with her hands. A character can't
      benefit from both handwraps and other items that provide enhancement
      bonuses or weapon special abilities (such as an <em>amulet of mighty
      fists</em>) on the same attack.</p>
