    value: >-
      <p>The witch can partially transform an enemy into a pig. The effects of
      the transformation are mostly cosmetic and do not change the creature’s
      size category or overall shape, but the affected creature takes a –2
      penalty on Will saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the witch’s
      Intelligence modifier (Will negates).</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the affected creature’s hands (or paws) turn into hooves,
      preventing it from using claw attacks or taking any action that would
      require the creature to use its fingers.</p>
