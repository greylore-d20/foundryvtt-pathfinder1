      <p>A <em>lesser geas</em> places a magical command on a creature to carry
      out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as
      desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to
      understand you. While a <em>geas</em> cannot compel a creature to kill
      itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause
      almost any other course of activity.</p><p>The <em>geas</em>ed creature
      must follow the given instructions until the <em>geas</em> is completed,
      no matter how long it takes.</p><p>If the instructions involve some
      open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own
      actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster
      level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</p><p>If the
      subject is prevented from obeying the <em>lesser geas</em> for 24 hours,
      it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2
      penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced
      to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24
      hours after the subject resumes obeying the <em>lesser geas</em>.</p><p>A
      <em>lesser geas</em> (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by
      <em>break enchantment</em>, <em>limited wish</em>, <em>remove curse</em>,
      <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish</em>. <em>Dispel magic</em> does not affect
      a <em>lesser geas</em>.</p>
