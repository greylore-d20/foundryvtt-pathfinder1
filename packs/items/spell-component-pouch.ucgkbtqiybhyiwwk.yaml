      <p>A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the
      material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for
      components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that
      wouldnâ€™t fit in a pouch. Most spell component pouches are waterproof and
      can be strung onto a belt or bandolier.</p>
