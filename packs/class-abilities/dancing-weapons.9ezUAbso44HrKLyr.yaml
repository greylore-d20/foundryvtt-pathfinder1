      description: >-
        <p>As a standard action, a dancing weapon can be loosed to attack on its
        own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who
        loosed it and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of
        opportunity, and the activating character it is not considered armed
        with the weapon. The weapon is considered wielded or attended by the
        activating character for all maneuvers and effects that target items.
        While dancing, the weapon shares the same space as the activating
        character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack
        opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon accompanies the
        activating character everywhere, whether she moves by physical or
        magical means. If the activating character has an unoccupied hand, she
        can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action; when so
        retrieved, the weapon canâ€™t dance (attack on its own) again for 4
        rounds. This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons.</p>
