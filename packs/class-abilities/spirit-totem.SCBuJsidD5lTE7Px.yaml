  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the spirits that surround the barbarian make it difficult
      for her enemies to see her. The spirits grant the barbarian a 20% miss
      chance against ranged attacks and melee attacks made by creatures that are
      not adjacent to the barbarian (typically due to reach).</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the lesser spirit totem rage power to select this
      rage power.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
