      <p>While in the accurate stance, the barbarian ignores the miss chance for
      concealment and treats total concealment as concealment. She also ignores
      cover penalties except those from total cover.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must have the accurate stance rage power and be at least
      8th level to select this rage power.</p>
