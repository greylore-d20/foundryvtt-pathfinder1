    value: >-
      <p>The shaman transforms herself into another form for a number of minutes
      per day equal to her level, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.kouqz0pm1xl8xilm]{Alter Self}. This duration does
      not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments.
      Changing form (including changing back) is a standard action that doesnâ€™t
      provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
