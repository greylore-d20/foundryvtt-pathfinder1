These discreet tools, made of a metal alloy that springs straight once the tool is removed from the band, are sufficient to attempt <em>Disable Device</em> checks without penalty, and long enough to pick locks on manacles fastened around the wearer's hands (once she slips off the ring). The wearer gains a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Sleight of Hand</em> checks made to conceal the ring's nature from anyone searching her.</p>"
