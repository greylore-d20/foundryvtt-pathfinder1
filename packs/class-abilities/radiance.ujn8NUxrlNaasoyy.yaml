  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can touch a weapon to cause it to glow with
      light by expending 1 point of mental focus. The weapon produces light like
      a torch. For the purpose of darkness spells and abilities, this effect
      counts as a light spell of level 0, plus 1 additional spell level for
      every 2 occultist levels you possess. This light lasts for 1 minute per
      occultist level you possess. In addition, whenever the weapon scores a
      critical hit against a foe, the wielder can choose to end the effect,
      causing the foe to be surrounded by the radiance for 1d4 rounds.</p>

      <p>While illuminated in this way, the target canâ€™t benefit from
      concealment or invisibility, nor can it attempt Stealth checks to avoid
      being seen. All attack rolls made against an illuminated foe receive a +2
      circumstance bonus.</p>
