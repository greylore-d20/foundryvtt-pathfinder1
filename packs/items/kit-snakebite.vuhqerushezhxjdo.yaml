      <p>This kit contains three pliable suction cups, a constrictor strap, a
      tiny razor, and several vials of <em>snake</em> antivenom. When suffering
      a <em>poison</em> that was delivered by the bite attack of a
      <em>snake</em> (or other ophidian creature, such as a
      <em>serpentfolk</em>), as a <em>full-round action</em>, you can use this
      kit to gain a +4 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on the ongoing
      <em>Fortitude</em> saving throws against that <em>poison</em>. A snakebite
      kit is <em>exhausted</em> after 10 uses.</p>
