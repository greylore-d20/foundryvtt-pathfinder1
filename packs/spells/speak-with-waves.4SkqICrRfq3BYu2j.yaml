      <p>This spell functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.wgm8mm1za909pwch]{stone
      tell} but allows conversations only with a body of standing or flowing
      fresh water at least as large as you are. Flowing water can generally
      speak about events happening upstream but not events happening
      downstream.</p>
