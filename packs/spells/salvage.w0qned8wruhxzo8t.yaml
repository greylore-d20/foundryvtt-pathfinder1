      more, and sails re-weave themselves as the rigging snakes across the

      At the end of the duration, an air bubble forms around the repaired ship.
      If submerged, the ship shoots to the surface, erupting with a great splash
      before settling on the water.<p></p><p>Though the spell requires time to
      repair the ship, its effects are instantaneous. A <i>salvaged</i> ship
      cannot be dispelled to return it to a shipwreck. However, before the
      spell's duration ends and while the ship is still being repaired,
      <i>salvage</i> can be dispelled to interrupt the repair process. The ship
      remains in the condition it was in when the spell was interrupted until a
      new <i>salvage</i> spell is cast (but continues to age normally and
      suffers the effects of its environments). A new <i>salvage</i> spell's
      duration is modified by any repairs already begun.</p>
