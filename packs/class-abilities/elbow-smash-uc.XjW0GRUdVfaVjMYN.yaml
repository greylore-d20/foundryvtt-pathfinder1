  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The monk follows up a punch with a strike from his elbow. If the attack
      hits, the monk can make an additional attack using the same attack bonus
      as the punch at a â€“5 penalty. If this second attack hits, it deals damage
      as normal, but all of the damage is nonlethal.</p>

      <p>The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.</p>
