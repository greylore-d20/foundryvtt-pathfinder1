  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your connection to the skies above is so strong that your feet barely
      touch the ground. At 1st level, you no longer leave tracks.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, you can hover up to 6 inches above the ground or even
      above liquid surfaces, as if levitating.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to fly, as per the spell, for a
      number of minutes per day equal to your oracle level. This duration does
      not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute
      increments.</p>
