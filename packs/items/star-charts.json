While some go on long sojourns to the wilderness, others spend their evenings on high, lonely rooftops, gazing at the stars. These lonely souls use star charts to track the movement of the stars and other celestial bodies. Anyone referencing one of these charts on a clear night can attempt a DC 20 <em>Knowledge</em> (geography) check to determine her approximate location and the month. In addition, these charts grant a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Survival</em> checks made to avoid getting lost at night with a clear sky.</p>\r\n"
