  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarianâ€™s form becomes infused with chaos. She
      gains a +4 bonus on Escape Artist checks and has a 25% chance to ignore
      extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks. A barbarian must have
      the lesser chaos totem rage power to select this rage power.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>
