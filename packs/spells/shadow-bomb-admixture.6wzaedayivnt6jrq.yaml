      <p>Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a
      significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all
      bombs you create and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on
      your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to
      modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula
      with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you
      drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end
      and the new one becomes active.  When you throw a bomb and hit a direct
      target, a shadowy substance is released from the bomb covering the direct
      target and up to three creatures that take damage from the bomb's splash
      (alchemist's choice). The affected creatures must successfully make a
      Fortitude saving throw, or they gain concealment but treat all other
      creatures as having concealment for the duration of the <i>shadow bomb
      admixture</i>. This effect does not ignore spell resistance.</p>
