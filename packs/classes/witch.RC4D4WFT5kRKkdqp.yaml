      <p>Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through
      blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown.
      Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact
      made with an otherworldly power. Communing with that source, using her
      familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a
      number of strange abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she
      might learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully
      unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it might be
      or where its true purposes lie.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of
      civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of
      witches’ spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles,
      from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that
      are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater
      knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide
      them.</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: Any.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d6.</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>
