      <p>This spell creates a 1-foot-long spike of cold iron that you fling at
      your target as a ranged touch attack. The stake is treated as a magic and
      cold iron weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, and deals
      1d6 points of piercing damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum
      10d6 at 20th level). Additionally, if a creature with DR/cold iron takes
      damage from this spell, it is sickened for 1 round and must attempt a
      Fortitude save. If it fails, for a number of rounds equal to your caster
      level, it must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to any
      normally required concentration checks) to use any spells or spell-like
      abilities it has-the DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell's
      level. If the creature fails this concentration check, its spell is
      wasted.</p>
