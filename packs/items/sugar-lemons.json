If, within 8 hours of consuming a <em>meal</em> seasoned with Sugar lemons, you gain the <em>confused</em> condition, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the result from the result of your d% roll to determine what action you take for the first round in which you are <em>confused</em>. This benefit does not stack with itself.</p>\n<p>The price and weight listed represent a jar containing enough preserved lemons to season 10 meals.</p>"
