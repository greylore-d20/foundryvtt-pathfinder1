      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.smbkd2yobhshbpqf]{charm monster}, except
      that mass charm monster affects a number of creatures whose combined HD do
      not exceed twice your level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If
      there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one
      at a time until you must choose a creature with too many HD to affect.</p>
