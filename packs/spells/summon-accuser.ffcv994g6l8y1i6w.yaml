  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell summons a single accuser devil from Hell to do the
      spellcaster's bidding, similar to how <i>summon monster</i> spells
      function. Accuser devils, known to diabolists as zebubs, are hideous
      flying creatures with the torso of a plump human infant and the body and
      wings of an enormous fly. They make excellent spies, for they have the
      ability to grant visions of what they have witnessed to others-the Queen's
      Hands sometimes use summoned zebubs to observe suspects from afar. Accuser
      devils are detailed on page 84 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
      2</i>.</p>
