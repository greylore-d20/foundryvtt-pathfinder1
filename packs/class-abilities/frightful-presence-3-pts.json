      "value": "<p>An eidolon becomes unsettling to its foes, gaining the frightful presence ability. The eidolon can activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or attack. Opponents within 30 feet of the eidolon must make a Will save or become shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Charisma modifier. If the eidolon has at least 4 more Hit Dice than an opponent, that opponent becomes frightened instead. Foes with more HD than the eidolon are immune to this effect.</p>\n<p>The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.</p>"
