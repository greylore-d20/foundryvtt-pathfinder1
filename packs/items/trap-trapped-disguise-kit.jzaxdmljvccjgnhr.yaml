  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This appears to be a normal disguise kit, except that if any of the
      makeup or false facial hair is applied, the victim is marked with a strong
      <em>scent</em>. This scent mark decreases the DC of tracking the victim by
      <em>scent</em> by 4. The mark can be washed off with vigorous scrubbing,
      but otherwise fades on its own over several days.</p>
