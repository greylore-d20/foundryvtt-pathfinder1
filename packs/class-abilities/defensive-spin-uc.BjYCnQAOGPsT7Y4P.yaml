  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The monk spins about, confounding his foe. If the attack hits, the monk
      gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC against any attacks made by the target of the
      style strike until the start of his next turn. This bonus does not stack
      with itself.</p>

      <p>The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.</p>
