      <p>At 1st level, with a successful melee touch attack you can steal the
      breath from an opponent’s lungs, leaving it unable to speak, use breath
      weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or do anything else requiring
      breath for 1 round. If the target fails at a Fortitude saving throw, it’s
      also staggered for 1 round as it catches its breath. If the target was
      attempting to hold its breath, it can no longer do so: it must breathe on
      its turn or risk suffocation and unconsciousness.</p>

      <p>Creatures that don’t need to breathe are unaffected.</p>

      <p>Regardless of whether it succeeds at its saving throw, the target is
      immune to further uses of your airless touch for 24 hours.</p>
