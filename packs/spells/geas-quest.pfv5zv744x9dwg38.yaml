      <p>This spell functions similarly to
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.ofw6gnp6r7t2wcba]{lesser geas}, except
      that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.</p><p>If
      the subject is prevented from obeying the <em>geas/quest</em> for 24
      hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day,
      another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can
      be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are
      removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the
      <em>geas/quest</em>.</p><p>A remove curse spell ends a <em>geas/quest</em>
      spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster
      level. <em>Break enchantment</em> does not end a <em>geas/quest</em>, but
      limited <em>wish</em>, miracle, and <em>wish</em> do.</p><p>Bards,
      sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as <em>geas,</em> while
      clerics call the same spell quest.</p>
