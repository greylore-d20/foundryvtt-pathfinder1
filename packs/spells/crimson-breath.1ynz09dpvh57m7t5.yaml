    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, your salivary glands transform and instantly
      fill with potent venom. Make a ranged touch attack against a single target
      in range; if you hit, the target is affected by a dose of breath of the
      mantis god (see page 158). The Fortitude save DC for this poison is the
      same as the spell's DC, not the standard save DC for the poison.</p>
