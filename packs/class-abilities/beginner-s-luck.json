      "value": "<p>The vigilante appears so harmless and innocent that onlookers dismiss his incredible abilities as nothing more than beginner’s luck. When the vigilante uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity, he can add the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise to his Disguise check to fool onlookers, so long as the number of onlookers witnessing him is no greater than his vigilante level. The vigilante’s PC allies do not count as onlookers (and at the GM’s discretion, a closely allied NPC might not count as an onlooker, either). He loses this bonus against onlookers who have already witnessed him using a vigilante talent in his social identity within the last week.</p>"
