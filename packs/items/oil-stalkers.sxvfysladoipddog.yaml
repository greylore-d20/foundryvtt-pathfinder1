    value: >-
      <p>This is a clear, viscous liquid that is typically kept in a frosted
      glass vial with an unassuming label and cork. The oil is used to reduce
      the sound armor and weapons make while moving.</p><p>Applying this oil to
      a single piece of equipment takes 1 minute and grants the wearer a +2
      <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Stealth</em> checks for 30 minutes. A
      <em>vial</em> of this oil is enough to coat one Medium piece of equipment,
      while a Large piece of equipment requires 4 vials. Two pieces of Small
      equipment can be covered with a single vial of oil. Exposure to or
      submersion in large amounts of water, such as swimming, immediately ends
      the effect of the oil.</p>
