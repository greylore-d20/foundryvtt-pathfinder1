      <p>A survival kit provides the necessary tools for day-to-day existence in
      a temperate wilderness. It typically contains a <em>flint and steel</em>,
      a <em>mess kit</em>, two waterskins (enough to hold water for 1 person for
      1 day), very basic maps showing major landmarks, and a small utility
      knife.</p>

      <p>A masterwork survival kit contains higher quality gear and a guide to
      identifying flora and fauna. It grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on
      Survival checks to get along in the wild, deal with severe weather, keep
      from getting lost, avoid natural hazards such as quicksand, and predict
      the weather.</p>
