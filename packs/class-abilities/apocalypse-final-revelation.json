Anytime you successfully cast a spell or use an ability that bestows 1 or more negative levels, the effect bestows 1d4 additional negative levels. Whenever you confirm a critical hit against a creature (including with a melee, ranged, or spell attack), as a swift action you can curse the target of your attack, as the bestow curse spell, except the target doesn’t receive a Will saving throw to negate the effects and spell resistance does not apply against this ability.</p>"
