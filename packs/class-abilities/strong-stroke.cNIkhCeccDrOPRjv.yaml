    value: >-
      <p>A rogue with this talent rolls twice when making Swim checks and takes
      the better result. If she already rolls twice while making a Swim check
      because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight bonus on both
      of those rolls instead. If the rogue is under the effect of a spell or
      ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse result, she
      only needs to roll 1d20 while making Swim checks.</p>
