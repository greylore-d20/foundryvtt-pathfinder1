      <p>You throw a volatile sphere of solid matter that shatters into
      countless shards. Attempt a ranged attack roll against a target within 120
      feet. If you hit, the target takes your kinetic blast damage with no
      saving throw. All other creatures and objects within a 20-foot burst take
      half the normal amount of damage and can attempt a Reflex save to reduce
      that damage by half again. If the attack misses its target, the blast has
      no effect. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p>
