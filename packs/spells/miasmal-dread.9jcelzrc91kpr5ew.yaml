      <p>A cloud of sickly green mist pours from your mouth and coalesces around
      creatures in the cone. Attempt a single Intimidate check to demoralize as
      part of casting the spell, comparing the result against the DC to
      Intimidate each foe within the area. You demoralize all foes whose DC you
