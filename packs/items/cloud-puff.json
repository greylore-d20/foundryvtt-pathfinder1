This requires a successful DC 12 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check.</p>\r\n<p><b>Use</b> By crushing a dried cloud puff and inhaling the spores, a creature becomes light-headed and its mind grows resistant to outside influences. For the next hour, the creature gains a +2 <em>alchemical bonus</em> on saving throws against <em>mind-affecting</em> effects but takes a -2 penalty on <em>Wisdom</em>-based skill checks.</p>\r\n"
