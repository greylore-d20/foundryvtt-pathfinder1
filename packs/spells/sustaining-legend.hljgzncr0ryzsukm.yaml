      <p>The rulers of Azlant are thought to have used this spell to amplify the
      mythic power of themselves and their most gifted lieutenants. You amplify
      the mythic power of the target creatures, bolstering them with healing
      energy each time they draw upon their mythic abilities. When a creature
      affected by this spell expends uses of mythic power for any ability, it
      immediately heals 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
      +25). In addition, the creature benefits from one of the following
      additional effects.</p><p></p><ul><li> Remove any one of the following
      conditions: dazzled, fatigued, shaken, sickened, or
      staggered.<p></p><p></p></li><li> Reduce the dazed or stunned condition to
      staggered.<p></p><p></p></li><li> Reduce the exhausted condition to
      fatigued.<p></p><p></p></li><li> Reduce the frightened condition to
      shaken, or the panicked condition to frightened.<p></p><p></p></li><li>
      Reduce the nauseated condition to sickened.</li></ul><p></p><p>A target
      can benefit from the effects of <i>sustaining legend</i> only once per
      round, even if the target expends multiple uses of mythic power during
      that time.</p>
