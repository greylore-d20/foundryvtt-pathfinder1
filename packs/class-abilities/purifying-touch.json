Each successful saving throw ends the related effect. The creature can choose not to make a save against an effect. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one additional time per day at 14th and 20th level.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Aura of Protection power of the Protection Domain.</p>"
