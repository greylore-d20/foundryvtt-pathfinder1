The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.0wamdkl9gp19l55w]{Planar Ally, Greater}. To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service).</p>\n<p>This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in the service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as a standard action, immediately removing the negative level.</p>"
