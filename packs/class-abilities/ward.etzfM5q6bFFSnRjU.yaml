      <p>The character can use this hex to place a protective ward over one
      creature. The warded creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a
      +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This ward lasts until the warded
      creature is hit or fails a saving throw. The character knows when a warded
      creature is no longer protected. The character can have only one ward
      active at a time. If the character uses this ability again, the previous
      ward immediately ends.</p><p>The character cannot use this ability on
      herself.</p><p>At 8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this
      ward increase by +1.</p>
