      <p>Targets in the area must succeed at a Will save or become deathly
      afraid of drowning. If the target is swimming or otherwise submerged in
      water, it must spend all of its efforts attempting to escape from the
      water. As long as an affected target remains in water, it takes 1d6 points
      of nonlethal damage each round as it thrashes about and swallows water.
      Even out of water, targets cannot imbibe potions or willingly interact
      with any fluids for the duration of this spell.</p>
