  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian who takes a drink of alcohol may attempt a
      new saving throw against one of the following conditions that may be
      affecting her: blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued,
      frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, or sickened. If she succeeds at
      the save, the effect is suppressed for the duration of the rage. She also
      may attempt a new saving throw if poisoned; a successful save counts
      against those required for a cure, but a failed save has no ill
      effect.</p>
