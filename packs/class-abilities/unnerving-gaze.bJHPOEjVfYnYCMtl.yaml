      <p>At 16th level, your foes begin to see flashes of the faces of dead
      loved ones when they look at your face. You gain a gaze attack with a
      range of 30 feet. All foes who fail a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your
      bloodrager level + your Charisma modifier) become shaken for 1d3
      rounds.</p>
