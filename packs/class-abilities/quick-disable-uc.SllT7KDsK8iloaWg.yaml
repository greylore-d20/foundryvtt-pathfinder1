  description:
    value: >-
      <p>It takes a rogue with this ability half the normal amount of time to
      disable a trap using the Disable Device skill (minimum 1 round). When she
      uses Disable Device to open a lock that would normally take a full-round
      action to open, she reduces the duration to a standard action.</p>
