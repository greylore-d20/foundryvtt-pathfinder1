      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> Yes<p>“Lich” is an acquired template that
      can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base
      creature), provided it can create the required phylactery. A lich retains
      all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted
      here.<p><b>CR:</b> Same as the base creature + 2.<p><b>Alignment:</b> Any
      evil.<p><b>Type:</b> The creature's type changes to undead. Do not
      recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.<p><b>Senses:</b> A lich gains
      darkvision 60 ft.<p><b>Armor Class:</b> A lich has a +5 natural armor
      bonus or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is
      better.<p><b>Hit Dice:</b> Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to
      d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead,
      liches use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead
      of Constitution).<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A lich gains channel
      resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and immunity to cold and
      electricity (in addition to those granted by its undead traits). The lich
      also gains the following defensive ability.<p><em>Rejuvenation (Su):</em>
      When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the
      lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately
      begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby. This process takes
      1d10 days—if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery
      merely starts the process anew. After this time passes, the lich wakens
      fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body),
      usually with a burning need for revenge against those who previously
      destroyed it.<p><b>Melee Attack:</b> A lich has a touch attack that it can
      use once per round as a natural weapon. A lich fighting without weapons
      uses its natural weapons (if it has any) in addition to its touch attack
      (which is treated as a primary natural weapon that replaces one claw or
      slam attack, if the creature has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its
      weapons normally, and can use its touch attack as a secondary natural
      weapon.<p><b>Damage:</b> A lich's touch attack uses negative energy to
      deal 1d8 points of damage to living creatures + 1 point of damage per 2
      Hit Dice possessed by the lich. As negative energy, this damage can be
      used to heal undead creatures. A lich can take a full-round action to
      infuse itself with this energy, healing damage as if it had used its touch
      attack against itself.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A lich gains the two
      special attacks described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich's HD
      + lich's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.<p><em>Fear Aura (Su):</em>
      Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must
      succeed on a Will save or become frightened. Creatures with 5 HD or more
      must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to
      the lich's Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
      again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear
      effect.<p><em>Paralyzing Touch (Su): </em>Any living creature a lich hits
      with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently
      paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free
      the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, with a DC equal to the
      lich's save DC). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a
      lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check
      reveals that the victim is still alive.<p><b>Abilities:</b> Int +2, Wis
      +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution
      score.<p><b>Skills:</b> Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense
      Motive, and Stealth checks. A lich always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly,
      Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense
      Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the
      same as the base creature.</p>
