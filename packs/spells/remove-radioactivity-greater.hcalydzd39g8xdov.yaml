  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>remove radioactivity</i>, save that it cures
    all ability damage and drain due to radioactivity that the target has taken.
    In addition, you can deplete a radioactive object as well, although because
    you must touch the object to affect it, you expose yourself to at least 1
    round of contact with the object's radiation. You must succeed at a caster
    level check (DC = 5 + the Fortitude DC associated with the radiation effect)
    in order to deplete the object. If you are successful, the object no longer
    emits radiation. In the case of a nuclear reactor or atomic warhead, this
    permanently renders the reactor or warhead inert and harmless.</p>
