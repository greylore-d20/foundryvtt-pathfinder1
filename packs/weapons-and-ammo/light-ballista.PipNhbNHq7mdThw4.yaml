      release. Ballistae are direct-fire weapons.</p><p><em>Light</em>: This

      Large, maneuverable, and often mounted atop towers or even vehicles. Light

      weighted quarrels with blunt metal tips. These are used as long-range
      battering rams, shot at walls or the gates of castles. When they hit a
      wooden structure, they have a critical range of 19-20/Ã—3. Gate breaker
      ballistae have a hardness of 5 and 200 hit points. Gate breaker ballista
      bolts cost 50 gp and weigh 30 pounds each.</p>
