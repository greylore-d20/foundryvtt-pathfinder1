  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can call upon fey to play a prank on a
      creature within 30 feet as a dirty trick combat maneuver. Resolve this
      attempt as normal, except that it doesnâ€™t provoke attacks of opportunity,
      you use your oracle level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you
      add your Charisma modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity
      modifier. No save is allowed against this attempt, but a creature affected
      by this revelation cannot be the target of this revelation again for 1
      day.</p>
