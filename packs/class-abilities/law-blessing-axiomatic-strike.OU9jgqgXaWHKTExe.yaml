    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with the essence
      of law. For 1 minute, this weapon glows blue, pale yellow, or white and
      deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against chaotic creatures. During
      this time, it’s treated as lawful for the purposes of overcoming damage
      reduction. This additional damage doesn’t stack with the additional damage
      from the axiomatic weapon special ability.</p>
