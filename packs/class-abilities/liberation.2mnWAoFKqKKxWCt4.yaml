  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You have the ability to ignore impediments to your mobility. For a
      number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level, you can move normally
      regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if you were
      affected by freedom of movement. This effect occurs automatically as soon
      as it applies. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
