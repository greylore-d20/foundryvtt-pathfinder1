    value: >-
      <p>When a character selects this talent, she must choose the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf-content.pf-class-abilities.Item.ztbBJa1juaYYOAWd]{confused},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf-content.pf-class-abilities.Item.iwpsiqOosVvH8Gp5]{shaken},
      or
      @UUID[Compendium.pf-content.pf-class-abilities.Item.dTseFA94lu1HcJJr]{sickened}
      condition. When the character has the selected condition and hits a
      creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the character
      no longer has that condition. A character can take this talent up to three
      times. Each time, she must select a different condition that she is able
      to remove from herself with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage.
      Even if the character has taken this talent multiple times, she can remove
      only a single effect on herself with each melee attack that deals sneak
      attack damage.</p>
