      <p>You fill the targets' minds with feelings of tranquility. Those
      attempting to commit violence become stricken with wracking pain and take
      3d6 points of nonlethal damage each round they attempt to harm another
      creature. If attacked, affected individuals can defend themselves and may
      participate in combat by using Combat Expertise, fighting defensively, or
      taking the total defense action without triggering the spell's nonlethal
      damage.</p>
