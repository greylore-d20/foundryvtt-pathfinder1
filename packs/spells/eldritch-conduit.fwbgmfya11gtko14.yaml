      <p>Originally created by a disciple of the archwizard Nex, this spell was
      used to turn enemy soldiers in Geb's undead armies into conduits capable
      of blasting spell energy back into the far reaches of the Gebite lines.
      Since then, it has become a favorite among arcane casters with an
      understanding of battlefield tactics.</p><p>If the target of this spell
      fails to resist its effects with a Will save, he becomes outlined in faint
      radiance, as if via <i>faerie fire</i>. At any time before the <i>eldritch
      conduit</i> expires, you may cast another spell with an area effect of
      cone, cylinder, line, or sphere and use the subject of the <i>eldritch
      conduit</i> as the point of origin for that spell. Doing so ends the spell
      immediately. The target must be within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2
      levels) in order for you to use the conduit-if the target moves out of
      range, the <i>eldritch conduit</i> effect persists but cannot be utilized
      by you until you get back within range.</p>
