      <p>The barbarian can leave herself open to attacks while preparing
      devastating counterattacks. Enemies gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage
      rolls against the barbarian while sheâ€™s in this stance, but every attack
      against the barbarian provokes an attack of opportunity from her, which is
      resolved prior to each provoking attack. This is a stance rage power. A
      barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage
      power.</p><hr><p><span class="notImp">This buff acts as a placeholder to
