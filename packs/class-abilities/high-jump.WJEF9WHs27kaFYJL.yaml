  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, a monk adds his level to all <em>Acrobatics</em> checks
      made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition,
      he always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using
      <em>Acrobatics</em>. By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a <em>swift
      action</em>, a monk gains a +20 bonus on <em>Acrobatics</em> checks made
      to jump for 1 round.</p>
