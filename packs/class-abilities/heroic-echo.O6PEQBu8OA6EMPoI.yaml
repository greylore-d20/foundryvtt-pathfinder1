  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, when you receive a <em>morale bonus</em> from any spell,
      <em>spell-like ability</em>, or magic item, including those you cast on
      yourself, that bonus increases by +1. At 9th level, this ability also
      applies to competence bonuses. If you receive a morale effect (or a
      competence effect at 9th level) that affects an area or multiple targets,
      as an <em>immediate action</em> you can share your increased bonus with
      all other recipients. This increase to other participants lasts a number
      of rounds equal to your <em>Charisma</em> bonus. You can use this ability
      once per day, plus one time per three levels after 3rd.</p>
