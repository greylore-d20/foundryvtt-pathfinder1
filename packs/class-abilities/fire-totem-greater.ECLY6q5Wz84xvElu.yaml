  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While raging, the barbarian can envelope herself in a cloud of smoke
      that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere and follows her as she moves. Creatures
      in the affected area must succeed at Fortitude saves each round or suffer
      the effects of breathing heavy smoke. The barbarian is immune to the
      smokeâ€™s effects, including vision obstruction. She can end this smoke as a
      free action, or it can be dispersed by wind in the same manner as a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud} spell.</p>
