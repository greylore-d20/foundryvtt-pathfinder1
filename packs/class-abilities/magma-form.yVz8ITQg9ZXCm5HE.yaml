    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can assume the form of a Small magma
      elemental, as @Compendium[pf1.spells.pawbnw1nm4f0b98e]{Elemental Body I}.
      You gain the same abilities as if you had chosen an earth elementalâ€™s
      form, except your earth glide functions as the earth glide ability of a
      magma elemental.</p>

      <p>At 9th level, you can assume the form of a Medium magma elemental, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.yldjnorgbx4jsldz]{Elemental Body II}.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, you can assume the form a Large magma elemental, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.hd32fuc6e7j4isbn]{Elemental Body III}.</p>

      <p>At 13th level, you can assume the form of a Huge magma elemental, as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.v42t5kpxc8mvd615]{Elemental Body IV}.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 hour per
      oracle level.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to choose this revelation.</p>
