      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you can create a 20-foot aura that causes enemies within to be overcome with feelings of isolation and loss. Your enemies treat the aura as difficult terrain, as they become sluggish within its area of effect. Furthermore, while within the aura, your enemies canâ€™t flank with one another, nor can they use or benefit from the aid another action. The aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, but the rounds need not be consecutive. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Part the Veil power of the Void Domain.</p>"
