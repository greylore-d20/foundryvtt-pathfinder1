      <p>You create a mobile area of bright light centered on one target while
      simultaneously suppressing other light sources surrounding it. The light
      level in the target's space increases to bright light, causing the target
      to take any penalties that it would normally take in bright light. In
      addition, all mundane light sources (and magic light sources of 3rd spell
      level or lower) within 20 feet of the target's space are suppressed,
      shedding no light as long as they remain within this spell's affected area
      and reverting the area normally affected by those light sources to their
      unmodified illumination levels.  The effects of spotlight are centered on
      the target and move as the target does. As a result, the target takes a
      -20 penalty on all Stealth checks for the spell's duration and cannot
      benefit from concealment normally provided by darkness, as though
      illuminated with <i>faerie fire</i>.  If the target succeeds at its Reflex
      save, the spotlight is created in the target's square but does not move
      with the target, and it hinders the Stealth checks only of creatures
      within that square.</p>
