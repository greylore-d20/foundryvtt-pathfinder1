  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, once per day, you can make one melee attack against an
      opponent within reach in response to an attack that would reduce you to
      negative hit points. Once your attack is resolved, you suffer the normal
      effect of the attack that provoked this ability. Effects that kill you or
      do not reduce you to negative hit points (such as ability damage or drain,
      negative levels, and disintegrate) do not trigger this ability.</p>
