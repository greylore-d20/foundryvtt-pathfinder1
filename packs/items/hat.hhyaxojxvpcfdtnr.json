Ranging from the turban to the headscarf to the tricorn to the furred cap, a hat can be a simple covering for the head or a sign of rank and status. Particular hats are sometimes mandatory for social or religious sects. Pirates often wear bandanas or tricorn hats, while captains prefer bicornes and may wear them either \"fore-and-aft\" (with the points in front of and behind them) or \"athwart\" (sideways.)</p>"
