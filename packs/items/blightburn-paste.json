Inside the compartment is a half-ounce of deep green paste. This paste is made of animal fat mixed with ground-up blightburn. Once the box is opened, blightburn paste limits <em>teleportation</em> within 60 feet and irradiates anyone within 60 feet, afflicting them with blightburn sickness (see sidebar for details on both effects). Any creature that touches the paste is afflicted with blightburn sickness (no save), and takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round until the paste is cleaned away with a successful DC 15 <em>Heal</em> check.</p>\r\n<p><b>Create</b>: <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) DC 30</p>\r\n<p><b>Blightburn</b>: The mineral blightburn is a green-glowing crystal and burns anyone who touches it, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage per round of contact, and its radiation causes blightburn sickness.</p>\r\n<p>The substance also limits <em>teleportation</em>.
