  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman can move through nonmagical fog, rain, mist, snow, and other
      environmental effects without penalty (see Weather, Core Rulebook 437).
      She is never slowed by such effects, and she doesnâ€™t need to attempt
      Acrobatics skill checks to move across such surfaces. She can also move
      through magical environmental effects that she created.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, the shaman can see twice as far as normal through
      environmental effects, whether or not they are magical in nature.</p>
