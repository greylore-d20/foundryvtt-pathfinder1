  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian howls during combat, agitating nearby fauna. Willing
      animals and magical beasts within 30 feet of the barbarian gain the
      benefits of the <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=rage">rage</a> spell
      for as long as she maintains her rage. After the barbarianâ€™s rage ends,
      creatures affected by her rage are fatigued for the same number of rounds
      as the barbarian.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</p>
