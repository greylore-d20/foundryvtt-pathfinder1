She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p>\n<p>Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogueâ€™s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.</p>\n<p>A rogue cannot choose a ninja trick with the same name as a rogue talent.</p>"
