  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You leave a magical trace in the mind of a creature with an attitude of
    at least indifferent toward you. The target takes a cumulative -2 penalty on
    its Will save to negate the spell for each step by which its attitude is
    better than indifferent.  The target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws
    against divination spells you cast. You can target that creature with
    mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than <i>Seeds of Influence</i>
    as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the modified spell
    doesn't take longer to cast and doesn't use a higher-level spell slot).
    Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a divination or
    mind-affecting spell you cast, <i>Seeds of Influence</i> ends for that
    target. A creature can  be subject to only one <i>Seeds of Influence</i>
    spell at a time; later castings of <i>Seeds of Influence</i> remove any
    previous casting.</p>
