      <p>Blending your form with crystal, you have transmuted yourself into
      something akin to an oread. You keep your original racial abilities
      (including your ability score adjustments, but not your movement speed)
      and also gain all oread racial abilities (including an oread’s movement
      speed and the outsider [native] type) except for ability score
      adjustments. You have the crystalline form alternate racial trait
      (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 144) instead of earth affinity, but
      cannot otherwise choose alternate racial traits.</p>
