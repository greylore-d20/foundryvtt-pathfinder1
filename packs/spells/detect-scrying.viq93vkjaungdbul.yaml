    value: >-
      <p>You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of
      a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The spell's area radiates from you
      and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor
      within the spell's area.</p><p>If the scrying attempt originates within
      the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier
      immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you
      at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier
      and an accurate sense of his direction and distance from you.</p>
