    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates a subtle illusion, causing any divination (scrying)
      spell used to view anything within the area of this spell to instead
      receive a false image (as the <i>major image</i> spell), as defined by you
      at the time of casting. As long as the duration lasts, you can concentrate
      to change the image as desired. While you aren't concentrating, the image
      remains static.</p>
