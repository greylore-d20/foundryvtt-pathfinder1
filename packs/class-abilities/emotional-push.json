      "value": "<p>You can draw upon the intense power of your own emotions in desperate situations, and your allies can call upon you through your emotional link to protect themselves. When you or a subject of your emotional bond must attempt a saving throw, the person attempting the save can gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on the save as an immediate action.</p>\n<p>This ability can be used once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 psychic levels you possess. Allies using this ability don’t need your permission, since the emotional connection is so direct, though you know when one of the uses has been expended. If the ally’s saving throw is successful, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.</p>"
