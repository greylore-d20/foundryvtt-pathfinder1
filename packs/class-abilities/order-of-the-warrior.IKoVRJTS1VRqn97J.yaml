      <p>Most samurai swear themselves to the code of the warrior, which
      emphasizes duty, honor, loyalty, and obedience. This code extends not only
      to the samurai's lord and master, but also to his comrades and family.
      Samurai who follow the order of the warrior are among the most trusted and
      feared warriors in the land.</p><p><b>Edicts:</b> The samurai must protect
      the life and lands of his lord with his life. He must be truthful and
      courageous, respectful to his elders and his masters, and loyal to his
      friends and liege. He must conduct himself with honor and
      dignity.</p><p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever an order of the warrior samurai
      declares a challenge, he receives damage reduction 1/â€” against attacks
      made by the target of his challenge. This DR increases by +1 for every
      four levels the samurai possesses.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> An order of the
      warrior samurai adds Knowledge (history) (Int) and Knowledge (nobility)
      (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the warrior samurai can
      make Knowledge (nobility) checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill,
      he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his samurai level (minimum
      +1) as long as the check involves the nobles or politics of his
      land.</p><p><b>Order Abilities:</b> A samurai who belongs to the order of
