      <p>Bolines are hook-shaped knives commonly used by herbalists and
      spellcasters to harvest ingredients for their craft. A boline's blade is
      typically 5 inches long, and is too small and irregular to use as a
      weapon. You can use a boline to finely slice the herbs in a <em>healer's
      kit</em>, so you can treat <em>deadly</em> wounds with only a single use
      from a <em>healer's kit</em> rather than two uses.</p>
