      "value": "<p>The rogue is an expert at appearing to be an unimportant servant, be it an attach√©, bodyguard, driver, maid, kitchen assistant, or similar staff member. The rogue gains a +2 bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be a servant, but not to impersonate a particular servant. She also gains a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to lie to maintain this guise. While disguised as a servant, she gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information among servants. Because she is easily overlooked as a servant, she can gather information from those she serves without asking them questions directly or alerting them to her interest. Doing so takes 1d4 days and requires a successful Bluff check instead of a Diplomacy check. At 8th level, the bonuses granted by this talent increase to +4.</p>"
