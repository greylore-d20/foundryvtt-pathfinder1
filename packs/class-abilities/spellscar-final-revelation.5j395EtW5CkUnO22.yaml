      <p>At 20th level, you become a master of primal magic. Whenever you cast a
      spell, you can choose to trigger a primal magic event in addition to
      casting the spell itself—you can use this ability once per minute. If your
      spellcasting causes a primal magic event to occur, your spell effect is
      not replaced by the primal magic event—it takes place normally, along with
      the event itself.</p>
