  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura to either ward off or welcome
      emotional influence for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard
      level. If you choose to ward, you and your allies within this aura receive
      a +4 <em>morale bonus</em> on saves against mind-affecting spells and
      effects, and any fear effects targeting you or your allies are reduced by
      one step (<em>shaken</em> has no effect, <em>frightened</em> becomes
      <em>shaken</em>, and <em>panicked</em> becomes <em>frightened</em>). If
      you chose to enhance emotional influence, enemies within the aura receive
      a â€“2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. These
      rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
