  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You spit a poisonous stinger around the size of a quill at a creature
    within range, as though you had fired a dart from a blowgun. You must
    succeed at a ranged attack to hit your target. The stinger deals 1d2 points
    of piercing damage and poisons the target, causing it to become nauseated
    for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.</p>
