    value: >-
      <p>You spit a poisonous stinger around the size of a quill at a creature
      within range, as though you had fired a dart from a blowgun. You must
      succeed at a ranged attack to hit your target. The stinger deals 1d2
      points of piercing damage and poisons the target, causing it to become
      nauseated for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.</p>
