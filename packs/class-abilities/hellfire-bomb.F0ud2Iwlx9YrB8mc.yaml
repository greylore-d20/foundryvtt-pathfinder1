      <p>This discovery is available to tiefling alchemists.</p>

      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can have it act as an explosive
      bomb, but deal half of its damage as fire damage and half as unholy damage
      that is not subject to fire resistance or immunity. An alchemist must be
      at least 9th level and have the explosive bomb discovery before selecting
      this discovery.</p>
