      <strong>Implantation</strong> 4</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A cybernetic leg
      completely replaces a normal leg, from the hip to the foot. It can take
      the place of a leg lost to a severing wound. The leg is fully functional
      and no different in appearance from a regular leg, although cyberart can
      be added to the leg at no additional cost. A cybernetic leg does not
      increase a user's Strength score. If both legs are replaced, they increase
      the user's base land speed by 10 feet and grant a +5 bonus to CMD against
      trip attempts and a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks.</p><p>The
      listed price, implantation, and install DC are for having two legs
      installed. A single cybernetic leg costs half the price and half the
      listed implantation value, but no significant bonus is granted to a
      creature with only one cybernetic leg. Both legs (or all legs, in the case
      of multilegged creatures) must be replaced for the above benefits to take
      effect.</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: Remove changes if only one leg is
      installed</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 25;
