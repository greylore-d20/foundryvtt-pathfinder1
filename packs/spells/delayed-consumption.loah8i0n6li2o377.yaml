      <p>When you consume this extract, you quickly consume another extract of
      your choice-this second extract's effects do not come into effect until a
      later point. You must consume this second, companion extract on the round
      following <i>delayed consumption</i> or waste the extract. The companion
      extract can be no higher than 4th level, and you must pay any costs
      associated with the companion extract when you consume it.</p><p>At any
      point during the duration of this extract, you can cause the companion
      extract to take effect as an immediate action. You can only have one
      <i>delayed consumption</i> in effect at one time. If a second is consumed,
      the first is dispelled without any effect.</p>
