  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of repetition for a number of
      rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All enemies within this aura
      must make a Will save each round or repeat their action from the previous
      round (if possible). Creatures that attacked on the previous round attack
      again on the following round, although they may change their target.
      Creatures that moved the previous round must take the same move action
      again, although they may change their route. Creatures that drank a potion
      must do so again, even they can only drink from an empty bottle. Actions
      that cannot be repeated are wasted. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Dancing Weapon power of the Artifice
      Domain.</p>
