      "value": "<p>At 16th level, when you confirm a critical hit, some of your black blood seeps into the targetâ€™s wounds. The next time the target would be healed by positive energy, the healing burns away the black blood and ends this effect, providing no other benefit. This ability is not effective against creatures that have no blood. The black blood transfusion persists until it negates one positive energy healing effect, but it can be removed sooner with a successful DC 25 Heal check.</p>"
