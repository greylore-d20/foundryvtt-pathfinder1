  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, you can enter a trance in which you commune with the
      spirits of your ancestors. This trance lasts for 10 minutes, which must be
      uninterrupted and during which you can take no other actions. When you
      come out of this trance, you have gained mystical insight into the
      future.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, this insight acts as an
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.d1wxnax51cecplm4]{Augury} spell with 80%
      effectiveness.</p>

      <p>At 5th level, the insight takes the form of a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.pwueht12qqo0268e]{Divination} with 90%
      effectiveness.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the knowledge you gain is equivalent to a
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.p2kosvizylhy8vfa]{Commune} spell.</p>

      <p>None of these spell effects require material components.</p>
