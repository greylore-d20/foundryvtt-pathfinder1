      <p>Your kinetic blast surrounds your foes in elemental matter. Whenever a
      blast with this infusion deals damage to a foe, that foe becomes entangled
      for 1 minute. The foe can remove this condition as a standard action with
      a successful Escape Artist or Strength check (with the same DC as for
      saves against your kinetic blast) or by dealing an amount of damage to the
      entangling matter equal to double your kineticist level (the matter has
      hardness 0). If the foe was already entangled by this infusion and fails
      its save against a second instance of this infusion, the increased amount
      of elemental matter fuses to the ground, causing the foe to be rooted in
      place as though anchored to an immobile object.</p>
