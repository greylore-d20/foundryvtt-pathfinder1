That condition is suspended for 1 round, and the chosen creature gains the confused condition instead. The confused creature rerolls any result other than “attack self ” or “attack nearest creature.” The round spent confused counts toward the duration of the suspended effect. At the end of the confused round, the suspended condition resumes.</p>"
