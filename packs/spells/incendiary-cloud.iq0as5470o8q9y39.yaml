      <p>An <i>incendiary cloud</i> spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot
      through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a <i>fog
      cloud</i> does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal
      6d6 points of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each
      round. All targets can make Reflex saves each round to take half
      damage.</p><p>As with a <i>cloudkill</i> spell, the smoke moves away from
      you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke's new spread each round
      based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where
      you were when you cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud
      move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would
      extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the
      remainder's spread thereafter.</p><p>As with <i>fog cloud</i>, wind
      disperses the smoke, and the spell can't be cast underwater.</p>
