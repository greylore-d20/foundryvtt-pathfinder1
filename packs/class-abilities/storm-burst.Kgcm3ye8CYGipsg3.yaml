  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can create a storm burst targeting any foe
      within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The storm burst deals 1d6 points
      of nonlethal damage + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess. In
      addition, the target is buffeted by winds and rain, causing it to take a
      â€“2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 round. You can use this ability a number
      of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
