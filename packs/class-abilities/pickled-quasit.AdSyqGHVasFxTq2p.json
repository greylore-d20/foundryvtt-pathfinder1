      "value": "<p>The alchemist has learned how to seal a quasit in a bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the quasit. The quasit is not under the alchemistâ€™s control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The quasit remains for 1 round per caster level, then collapses into its associated elements. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a pickled quasit requires a 4th-level extract.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 10th level to select this discovery.</p>"
