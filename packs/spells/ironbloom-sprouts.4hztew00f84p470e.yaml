  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like <i>goodberry</i>, except as noted above and
      that it transforms 2d4 mushrooms into magical ironbloom mushrooms rather
      than transforming common berries into magical berries. Alternatively, you
      may create twice as many mushrooms, but each only has the nourishment
      ability of a <i>goodberry</i> and not the healing properties.</p>
