  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This weapon has a blade concealed between the two halves of the handle
      that can be brought to bear quickly. If you are proficient with it (or
      have the Quick Draw feat), you may open it as a free action; a
      nonproficient user must spend a move action to open it. Otherwise, treat
      it as a dagger. When it's closed, you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand
      checks made to conceal it on your body.</p>
