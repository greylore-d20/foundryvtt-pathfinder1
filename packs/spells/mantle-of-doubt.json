    "shortDescription": "<p>You wrap your mind in phantasms of crippling doubt that assail any who dare harm you. When a creature within the mantle's radius attacks you or attempts to affect you with a harmful effect, it must succeed at a Will save as these spectres of uncertainty force themselves into its mind. Ongoing effects trigger the mantle only if the creature consciously directs them against you. A given creature need only roll a saving throw against your <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> at most once per round. If the creature's attack or effect against you was a psychic spell or spell-like ability, that creature's save takes a -4 penalty. A creatures that fails its save against your <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> is affected for 1d4+1 rounds, during which time it is shaken, cannot flank, and no longer threatens creatures within its reach. In addition, it takes a -2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting effects, which stacks with the penalties for being shaken. If your <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> affects a creature that is already shaken, that creature's fear level doesn't increase. Instead, mounting doubts stagger the creature for 1 round and deal 1d4 points of Wisdom and Charisma damage to it.  Spell resistance applies against assaults from a <i>Mantle of Doubt</i>, and immunity to fear or mind-affecting effects negates the spell's effects. If you are immune to fear or mind-affecting effects, you can still cast <i>Mantle of Doubt</i> on yourself.</p>",
