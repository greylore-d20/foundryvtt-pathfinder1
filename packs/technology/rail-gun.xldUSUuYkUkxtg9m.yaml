      touch</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A rail gun uses gravitons to compress raw
      metal scrap placed in its sequencing chamber into hyperdense shells that
      it then accelerates to astounding speed and fires from its
      electromagnetically charged barrel. The weapon's rate of fire is slow
      compared to most other technological weapons, yet its relatively high
      damage combined with its potential for particularly grisly critical hits
      makes it a much sought-after weapon for long-range combat. Shots fired
      from a rail gun bypass an object's first 10 points of hardness, and can
      completely penetrate targets without hardness.</p><p>When making an attack
      with a rail gun, make a single attack roll and compare that result to the
      ACs of all creatures in a line extending out to the weapon's maximum
      range. This weapon damages all targets with an AC equal to or lower than
      the attack roll. However, if the attack's damage fails to penetrate any
      target's hardness or damage reduction, this shot is blocked and cannot
      damage targets that are farther
      away.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 32;
