  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You can focus upon a single point within line of sight and discern if the
    terrain or geographic features of that point are illusory. This ability
    allows you a Will save to disbelieve a terrain-affecting illusion (glamer)
    effect from range as though you had interacted with it. In addition to
    affecting such spells as <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> and <i>mirage
    arcana</i>, this spell also allows you to disbelieve naturally occurring
    mirages.</p>
