      "value": "<p>You can perform a 1-minute ritual that infuses a flask of water with one of your prepared spells, creating an improvised potion that lasts until consumed or the next time you prepare spells. You can use this ability only with spells that target one or more creatures, and the maximum spell level you can infuse in this way is equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 cleric levels you have. These potions are treated as alchemist extracts for the purpose of your domain spells. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Artificer's Touch power from the Artifice Domain or the Hand of the Acolyte power from the Magic Domain.</p>"
