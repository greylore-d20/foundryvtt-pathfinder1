  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a
      heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of
      opportunity. A heavy crossbow fires crossbow bolts.</p><p>Normally,
      operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but
      not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls.
      You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on
      attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is
      cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
