  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This vestment works just like a cold-weather outfit, granting a +5
      <em>circumstance bonus</em> on <em>Fortitude</em> saving throws against
      exposure to cold weather, except it is custom made for an <em>animal
      companion</em>. The added cost represents custom tailoring to ensure that
      the furs used don't cause unwanted reactions from the <em>animal</em>
      wearing the outfit.</p>
