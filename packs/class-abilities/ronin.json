      "value": "<p>While most samurai belong to the order of the warrior, dedicating their considerable skills to the service of a lord, land, and people, some find themselves without a master, either as a result of disgrace or death, or occasionally by choice. Known as ronin, these samurai wander the lands, serving their own code of ideals. While ronin are significantly freer to do as they please, they do not receive the same respect and support that a more dedicated samurai can count on. Note that cavaliers can select this order, but they are typically called knights errant instead of ronin.</p><p><strong>Becoming Ronin:</strong> Normally, when a samurai wishes to change his order, he must undergo a lengthy process that requires him to adhere to the edicts of his new order for a period of time before receiving any benefits. This is not the case with ronin. Once a samurai decides to become a ronin, he immediately loses all of the bonuses, skills, and abilities of his old order and gains those of the ronin order. If he wishes to once again dedicate himself to another order, he must do so using the normal rules.</p><p><strong>Edicts:</strong> Ronin follow their own personal code of ethics and honor. As such, their edicts are extremely flexible and subject to change. Each ronin should determine his own edicts, which should include at least three provisions. These edicts are subject to GM approval.</p><p><strong>Challenge: </strong>Whenever a ronin is the target of a challenge, a smite, a quarry, or similar effect, and he issues a challenge against that character in return, the ronin receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge and a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of his challenge. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four class levels the samurai possesses (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level).</p><p><strong>Skills: </strong>A ronin adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Survival (Wis) to his list of class skills.</p><p><strong>Order Abilities:</strong> A ronin samurai gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Ability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>@Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.I1jekz0MhTB9eBO3]{Self Reliant}</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>@Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.IAeyujyPMotxLAYF]{Without Master}</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>@Compendium[pf1.class-abilities.UqXkF4tWmWpYIa9A]{Chosen Destiny}</td></tr></tbody></table>"
