      <p>This spell functions as per
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.2nn2tshkn4p7k25l]{entangle}, except it
      sets the foliage on fire. A creature that begins its turn
      <em>entangled</em> by the spell takes 4d6 points of fire damage (Reflex
      half), and a creature that begins its turn in the area but is not
      <em>entangled</em> takes 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex negates). Smoke
      rising from the vines partially obscures visibility. Creatures can see
      things in the smoke within 5 feet clearly, but attacks against anything
      farther away in the smoke must contend with concealment (20% miss chance).
      When the spell's duration expires, the vines burn away entirely.</p>
