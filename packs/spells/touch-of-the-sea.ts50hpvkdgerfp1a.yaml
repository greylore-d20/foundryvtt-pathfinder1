    value: >-
      <p>You cause webs to grow between the target's fingers and its feet to
      transform into flippers, granting a swim speed of 30 feet along with the
      standard +8 bonus on Swim checks and the ability to take 10 even if
      distracted or endangered. You can also use the run action while swimming,
      provided you swim in a straight line. This transformation causes any boots
      or gloves the target is wearing to meld into its form (although magic
      items with a continuous effect continue to function). This spell does not
      grant the target any ability to breathe water.</p>
