  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same
      material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the
      <i>fabricate</i> spell. The quality of items made by this spell is
      commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new
      fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic
      foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet. You must make an appropriate
      Craft check to <i>fabricate</i> articles requiring a high degree of
      craftsmanship. Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet of material to
      be affected by the spell.</p>
