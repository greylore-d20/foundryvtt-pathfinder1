    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions similarly to <i>lesser <i>geas,</i></i> except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.</p><p>If the subject is prevented from obeying the <i>geas/quest</i> for 24 hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the <i>geas/quest</i>.</p><p>A remove curse spell ends a <i>geas/quest</i> spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. <i>Break enchantment</i> does not end a <i>geas/quest</i>, but limited <i>wish</i>, miracle, and <i>wish</i> do.</p><p>Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as <i>geas,</i> while clerics call the same spell quest.</p>"
