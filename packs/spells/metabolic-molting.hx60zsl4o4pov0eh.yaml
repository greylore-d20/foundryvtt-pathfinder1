  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You encase the willing subject in a jeweled shell that has the same
    hardness and hit points as 5 inches of iron (hardness 10, hp 150). For 7
    days, the subject enters a state of suspended animation (as per
    <i>temporal</i> stasis), during which it heals from even the most grievous
    wounds. Each day, the subject regains 5 hit points per Hit Die it has as
    well as recovering from 2 points of ability damage or ability drain from any
    ability score of its choice. After 7 days, the shell crumbles away and the
    subject emerges, its body's severed limbs, broken bones, and ruined organs
    regrown (as per regenerate).  If the gemstone you use for the component is
    worth at least 5,000 gp, <i>metabolic molting</i> can bring a target back to
    life, as long as it has been dead for no more than 1 hour when the spell is
    cast. When the spell is used on such a creature, the creature comes back to
    life after 7 days and stabilizes at 0 hit points. A creature brought back to
    life through <i>metabolic molting</i> gains 1 permanent negative level, or 2
    points of Constitution drain if it is 1st level. Like <i>raise dead</i>,
    this spell can't save creatures slain by death effects.</p>
