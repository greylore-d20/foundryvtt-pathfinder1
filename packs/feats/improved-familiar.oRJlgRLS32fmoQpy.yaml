      <p><em>This feat allows you to acquire a powerful familiar, but only when
      you could normally acquire a new
      familiar.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Ability to acquire a
      new familiar, compatible alignment, sufficiently high level (see
      below).</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: When choosing a familiar, the
      creatures listed below are also available to you. You may choose a
      familiar with an alignment up to one step away on each alignment axis
      (lawful through chaotic, good through
      evil).</p><table><thead><tr><th>Familiar</th><th>Alignment</th><th>Arcane
      Spellcaster Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Celestial

      the rules for regular familiars, with two exceptions: if the creature's
      type is something other than animal, its type does not change; and
      improved familiars do not gain the ability to speak with other creatures
      of their kind (although many of them already have the ability to
      communicate).</p>
