      <p>These clothes are designed specifically to be expensive and gaudy.
      Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing. A would-be noble
      also needs a signet ring and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp) to
      accessorize this outfit.</p>

      <p>As this outfit does not cost 10 gp or less, player characters can not
      choose this outfit for free when first beginning play.</p>
