    value: >-
      <p>The rogue becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that she
      can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. The rogue selects a
      number of skills equal to her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill
      check with one of the selected skills (or any of the skills selected
      through the rogueâ€™s edge class feature), she can take 10 even if stress
      and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so.</p>

      <p>A rogue can gain this special ability multiple times, selecting
      additional skills for skill mastery to apply to each time.</p>
