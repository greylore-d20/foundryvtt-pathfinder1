  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of heroism for a number of
      rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Using this ability is a swift
      action. Allies in the area are treated as if they were under the effects
      of heroism. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Divine Presence power of the Glory Domain.</p>
