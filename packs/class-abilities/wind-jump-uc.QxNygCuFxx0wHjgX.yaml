  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a move
      action to grant himself a fly speed (with perfect maneuverability) equal
      to his base land speed. He must end his movement each round on solid
      ground (or some other surface that can support his weight) or fall as
      normal. Once activated, this ability lasts for 1 minute.</p>

      <p>A monk must be at least 8th level and have the high jump ki power
      before selecting this ki power.</p>
