  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You imbue a projectile weapon with the ability to ricochet any
    projectiles that hit one target so that they also hit another. When the
    wielder ricochets a projectile, she selects a primary target to attack. If
    she hits the primary target, the projectile ricochets instead of being
    destroyed. The wielder can then select a secondary target that is within 20
    feet of the primary target. She makes an attack roll against the secondary
    target at the same base attack bonus, but does not gain the benefit from any
    enhancement bonuses or magic qualities on the projectile. If the shot comes
    from a firearm, the ricochet targets normal AC rather than touch AC.  While
    the spell lasts, the target weapon's wielder can ricochet one projectile per
    three caster levels you possess, to a maximum of six at caster level 18th.
    Once the target weapon's wielder ricochets that many shots, the spell is
    discharged. If the weapon's wielder fails to use all the ricochets before
    the spell end, those ricochets are wasted.</p>
