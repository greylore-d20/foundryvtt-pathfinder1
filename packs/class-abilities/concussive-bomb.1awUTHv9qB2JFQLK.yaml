  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict
      sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4
      points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6.
      Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1
      minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.</p>

      <p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this
      discovery.</p>
