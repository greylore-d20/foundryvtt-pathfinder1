  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You grab a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby
    opponents or objects. You must target a specific creature when casting this
    spell and once you select that creature you cannot switch to another. Each
    round, as a standard action, you can attempt to hurl the target at any
    creature or object within 30 feet of it. You must make an attack roll
    whenever you use the target as a weapon. The attack bonus for this attack is
    equal to your caster level plus either your Intelligence or Charisma
    modifier (whichever is higher). If you successfully hit the new target with
    the creature both it and the creature take damage based on the creature's
    size.</p> <table border ='1'><tr><th>Creature Size</th><th>Damage

    The target creature can make a Fortitude saving throw each time you attempt
    to use it as a weapon. If it makes its saving throw it can act normally, but
    if it fails its save it loses all actions for the round and ends its turn
    prone in a square adjacent to the target of your attack. However, if the
    creature chooses to resist your efforts to move it, taking no other actions
    for the round, it gets a +4 circumstance bonus on its saving throw. The
    spell ends immediately if the target creature dies or is destroyed.</p>
