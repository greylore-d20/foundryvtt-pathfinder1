  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 19th level, the character's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He
      can now select a quarry as a <em>free action</em>, and can now take 20
      while using <em>Survival</em> to track his quarry, while moving at normal
      speed without penalty. His <em>insight bonus</em> to attack his quarry
      increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new
      one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>
