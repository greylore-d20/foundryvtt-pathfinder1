  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of divine presence for a
      number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All allies within
      this aura are treated as if under the effects of a sanctuary spell with a
      DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. These
      rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is a
      standard action. If an ally leaves the area or makes an attack, the effect
      ends for that ally. If you make an attack, the effect ends for you and
      your allies.</p>
