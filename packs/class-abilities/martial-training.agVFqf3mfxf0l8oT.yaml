  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter
      levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also
      counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have
      different effects based on whether the character has levels in those
      classes (such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.GsjouI6B8X7BA5wN]{Stunning Fist}
      and a monkâ€™s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats
      normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.GsjouI6B8X7BA5wN]{Stunning
      Fist}.&lt;/magic.wondrous%monk's&gt;</p>
