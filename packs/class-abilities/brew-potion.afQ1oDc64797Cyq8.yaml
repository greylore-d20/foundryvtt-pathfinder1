      <p>At 1st level, alchemists receive
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.nNVFVFRBCT4O2ab9]{Brew Potion} as a bonus feat. An
      alchemist can brew potions of any formulae he knows (up to 3rd level),
      using his alchemist level as his caster level. The spell must be one that
      can be made into a potion. The alchemist does not need to meet the
      prerequisites for this feat.</p>
