  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The body of the target creature twists and distorts, reshaping into a
    grotesque figure. Because of the disfigurement, the creature takes a â€“4
    penalty to Constitution and Charisma. The creature also receives one of the
    following deformities (your choice) from the list in the mutant acquired
    template: blind, deaf, fragile, fractured mind, lame, poor ability (applied
    to your choice of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Wisdom), spasms, and
    useless arm. The deformity is subject to all limitations described in the
    @Compendium[pf1.monster-templates.4pbHKe1aYEcjBEs4]{mutant} template (for
    example, this spell cannot impose the lame deformity on a creature with a
    base speed slower than 20 feet).</p>
