The barrier does not impede a spell's line of sight or effect.</p><p>The sphere is 1 inch thick per caster level, has hardness 5, and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. When an <i><i>ablative</i> sphere</i> loses hit points, the level of cover it provides is reduced. When the <i><i>ablative</i> sphere</i> has lost one-third of its hit points, it provides cover instead of improved cover. Once it has lost two-thirds of its hit points, it provides only partial cover. Finally, when the <i><i>ablative</i> sphere</i>'s hit points reach 0, the globe is destroyed. When an attack reduces an <i><i>ablative</i> sphere</i>'s hit points to 0, you take any remaining damage.</p>"
