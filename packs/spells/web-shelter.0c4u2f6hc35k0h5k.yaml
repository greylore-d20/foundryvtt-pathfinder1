  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a shelter of slightly sticky webbing. The shelter has a
      hinged door large enough to accommodate a Medium creature. The opaque
      walls of the shelter measure 1 inch thick and provide total cover to
      anyone within it.</p><p>Only Fine creatures with negligible Strength can
      be caught in the webbing (including swarms); all other creatures can pull
      themselves free without making a Strength check or taking an action. The
      webbing is sticky enough to hold twigs, leaves, dirt, and other light
      items, allowing you to conceal the shelter. The shelter is watertight and
      insulated when the door is closed. Its surface has a hardness of 0 and 2
      hit points for every 5-foot square of web surface area. It takes normal
      damage from fire and burns as easily as wood. When the spell ends, the
      webbing decays rapidly and disappears.</p>
