      <p>You alter an undead creature's energy affinity so that it takes damage
      from negative energy and gains healing from positive energy, as if it were
      a living creature. If the target was able to channel negative energy or
      produce negative energy effects (such as inflict spells), these abilities
      produce positive energy instead, healing living targets and harming the
      undead. The target cannot impose negative levels on other creatures for
      the duration of the spell. The target's creature type does not change, and
      it is still considered an undead creature. Each round on its turn, the
      subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a
      fullround action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
