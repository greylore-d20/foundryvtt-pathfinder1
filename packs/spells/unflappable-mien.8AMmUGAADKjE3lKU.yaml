  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a creature attempts to touch you with an attack (such as a
      <em>touch attack</em>, an <em>unarmed strike</em>, an attack with a
      <em>natural weapon</em>, or a <em>grapple</em>), it feels a field of force
      blocking its way. It can choose to abandon the attempt, losing its action,
      or to push through the ward. If it pushes through, you can trigger a wave
      of force against that creature. This discharges the spell, deals 1d4
      points of force damage per <em>caster level</em> (maximum 10d4), and
      pushes the creature back 5 feet. If the creature cannot be pushed back 5
      feet (if a solid surface is directly behind it, for example), it takes 2d4
      additional points of force damage. A successful <em>Fortitude</em> saving
      throw halves the total amount of force damage the creature takes.</p>

      <p>Members of the <em>Sanctified Prophet</em> prestige class can cast this
      spell, even though it is not a <em>divination</em> or
      <em>enchantment</em>.</p>
