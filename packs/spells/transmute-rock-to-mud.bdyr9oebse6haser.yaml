    value: >-
      <p>This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an
      equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth
      of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate,
      fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep,
      reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and
      AC. Brush or similar material thrown atop the mud can support creatures
      able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom
      can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.</p><p>If <i>transmute rock
      to mud</i> is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls
      to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling
      mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to
      anyone caught directly beneath the targeted area, or half damage to those
      who succeed on Reflex saves.</p><p>Castles and large stone buildings are
      generally immune to the effect of the spell, since <i>transmute rock to
      mud</i> can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to
      undermine such buildings' foundations. However, small buildings or
      structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or
      even partially toppled by this spell.</p><p>The mud remains until a
      successful <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>transmute mud to rock</i> spell
      restores its substance-but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the
      mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on
      exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.</p><p><i>Transmute rock to
