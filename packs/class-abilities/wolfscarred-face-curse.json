      "value": "<p>Your face is deformed, as though you were born with a wolf ’s muzzle instead of an ordinary nose and jaw. Many mistake you for a werewolf, and in areas plagued by lycanthropes, you must take pains to hide your face. You have a severe speech impediment, and any spells you cast with a verbal component have a 20% chance of failing, wasting your action but not expending the spell. You gain a natural bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if you are a Medium creature or 1d3 points of damage if you are Small.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you add @Compendium[pf1.spells.cfzk3vkv1c7ncaug]{Magic Fang} to your list of known spells and your bite damage increases to 1d6 if you are Medium or 1d4 if you are Small.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, the damage dealt by your bite attack increases to 1d8 if you are Medium or 1d6 if you are Small.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, you add @Compendium[pf1.spells.bgtmki0xl4xl4y91]{Magic Fang, Greater} to your list of known spells and the damage dealt by your bite attack increases to 2d6 if you are Medium or 1d8 if you are Small.</p>"
