      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>When used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet, this ceramic
      canister releases a mist of
      @Compendium[pf1.items.jrdrvgdrheqbihvz]{Defoliant} on impact.</p>

      <p>When it hits the target square, it deals <b>2d6 points of damage</b> to
      any creature in that space. Plant creatures within 30 feet of the target
      square take an additional <b>4d6 points of damage</b>. A successful <b>DC
      20 Fortitude saving throw</b> halves this additional damage.</p>

      <p>Plant creatures within 5 feet of the target space that fail their
      saving throws also take <b>1d4 points of Strength</b> damage and <b>1d4
      points of Constitution</b> damage. The defoliant also kills vegetation
      within 30 feet of the target square as described in <em>Ultimate
      Equipment</em>.</p>

      <h3>Mishap</h3>

      <p>On a siege engine mishap, this ammunition explodes before it's
      launched, dealing its damage to the siege engine and all nearby plant
      creatures as if one of the spaces of the siege engine (crew leader's
      choice) were the target square.</p>
