  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever a creature takes damage from one of your spells or effects
      that causes negative energy damage (such as inflict light wounds or the
      death's touch revelation), it begins to bleed, taking 1 point of damage
      each round. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, this damage
      increases by 1. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or any
      effect that heals damage.</p>
