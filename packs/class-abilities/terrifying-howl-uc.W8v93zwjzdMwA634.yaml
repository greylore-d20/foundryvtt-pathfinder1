    value: >-
      <p>The barbarian unleashes a terrifying howl as a standard action. All
      enemies that have been shaken by the barbarian (usually through the
      Intimidate skill) within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 +
      1/2 the barbarian’s level + her Strength modifier) or be panicked for
      1d4+1 rounds. Once an enemy has attempted a save versus this ability
      (whether successful or not), it’s immune to this power for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 8th level and have the intimidating glare
      rage power to select this rage power.</p>
