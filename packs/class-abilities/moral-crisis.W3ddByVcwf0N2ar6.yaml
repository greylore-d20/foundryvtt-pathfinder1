      <p>As a standard action, you can target a living creature within 30 feet
      of you, reminding it of its moral failings. The target must succeed at a
      Will save or be staggered for a number of rounds equal to your oracle
      level. The target can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns to end this effect. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.</p>
