  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet, this ceramic
      canister releases a mist of
      @Compendium[pf1.items.jrdrvgdrheqbihvz]{Defoliant} on impact.</p><p>When
      it hits the target square, it deals 2d6 points of damage to any creature
      in that space. Plant creatures within 30 feet of the target square take an
      additional 4d6 points of damage. A successful DC 20 Fortitude saving throw
      halves this additional damage.</p><p>Plant creatures within 5 feet of the
      target space that fail their saving throws also take 1d4 points of
      Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The defoliant also
      kills vegetation within 30 feet of the target square as described in
      <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>.</p><h3>Mishap</h3><p>On a siege engine
      mishap, this ammunition explodes before it's launched, dealing its damage
      to the siege engine and all nearby plant creatures as if one of the spaces
      of the siege engine (crew leader's choice) were the target square.</p>
