      <p>You encase the willing subject in a jeweled shell that has the same
      hardness and hit points as 5 inches of iron (hardness 10, hp 150). For 7
      days, the subject enters a state of suspended animation (as per
      <i>temporal</i> stasis), during which it heals from even the most grievous
      wounds. Each day, the subject regains 5 hit points per Hit Die it has as
      well as recovering from 2 points of ability damage or ability drain from
      any ability score of its choice. After 7 days, the shell crumbles away and
      the subject emerges, its body's severed limbs, broken bones, and ruined
      organs regrown (as per regenerate).  If the gemstone you use for the
      component is worth at least 5,000 gp, <i>metabolic molting</i> can bring a
      target back to life, as long as it has been dead for no more than 1 hour
      when the spell is cast. When the spell is used on such a creature, the
      creature comes back to life after 7 days and stabilizes at 0 hit points. A
      creature brought back to life through <i>metabolic molting</i> gains 1
      permanent negative level, or 2 points of Constitution drain if it is 1st
      level. Like <i>raise dead</i>, this spell can't save creatures slain by
      death effects.</p>
