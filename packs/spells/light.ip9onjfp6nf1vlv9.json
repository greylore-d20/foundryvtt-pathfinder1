In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.</p><p>You can only have one light spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent (through permanency or a similar effect), it does not count against this limit. Light can be used to counter or dispel any darkness spell of equal or lower spell level.</p>"
