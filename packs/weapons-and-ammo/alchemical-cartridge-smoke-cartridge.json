There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Smoke Cartridge</em></strong>: (<strong>Source</strong> <em>Heroes of Golarion pg. 18</em>) This cartridge can be loaded only into a weapon with the scatter quality. Upon striking a target, it deals no damage, but instead bursts into a cloud of smoke in a 20-foot radius. This smoke impairs sight beyond 5 feet; any creature farther away gains concealment (20% miss chance). The cloud disperses after 1d4 rounds, or in 1 round in light wind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
