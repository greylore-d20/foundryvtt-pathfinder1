    value: >-
      <p>You can study the sun and gaze upon any place its light touches. You
      can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.6kmkxepwgsbta6ui]{Clairaudience/Clairvoyance} as a
      spell-like ability, but only for visual observation and you can only place
      your sensor in places currently being touched by sunlight.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, you can instead use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g66w32kdup1f43bp]{Scrying} to observe any area
      touched by sunlight.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, you can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.glt6uk3n6g6l2p6l]{Scrying, Greater} instead. You
      must be at least 5th level to select this revelation.</p>

      <p>You can sungaze for 1 minute per day per oracle level; the duration
      need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>
