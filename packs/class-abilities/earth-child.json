You keep your original racial abilities (including your ability score adjustments, but not your movement speed) and also gain all oread racial abilities (including an oread’s movement speed and the outsider [native] type) except for ability score adjustments. You have the crystalline form alternate racial trait (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide&nbsp;144) instead of earth affinity, but cannot otherwise choose alternate racial traits.</p>"
