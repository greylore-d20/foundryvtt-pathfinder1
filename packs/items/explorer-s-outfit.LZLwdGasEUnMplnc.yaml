      <p>This set of clothes is for someone who never knows what to expect. It
      includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt
      (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a
      leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The
      clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also
      includes any extra accessories you might need, such as a scarf or a
      wide-brimmed hat.</p>
