    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions like @Compendium[pf1.spells.4ratngmltr3z4om5]{lesser angelic aspect}, except you gain low-light vision; darkvision 60 feet; DR 10/evil; immunity to acid, cold, and petrification; resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10; a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison; and protective aura and truespeech as supernatural abilities for the duration of the spell. Also, your wings give you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability. Protective aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures to anyone within 20 feet. Otherwise, it functions as a @Compendium[pf1.spells.1i8b1v3dngkxj6jp]{magic circle against evil} and a @Compendium[pf1.spells.exwa9xra4u82j0sx]{lesser globe of invulnerability}, both with a radius of 20 feet. Truespeech allows you to speak with any creature that has a language, as though using the @Compendium[pf1.spells.m1rmcpcaixcpz9ib]{tongues} spell.</p>",
