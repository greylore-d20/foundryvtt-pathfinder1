  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell functions like a <i>fly</i> spell, except you can <i>fly</i>
      at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if
      carrying a medium or heavy load) with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to
      half your caster level. When using this spell for long-distance movement,
      you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still
      requires Constitution checks). This means you can cover 64 miles in an
      8-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).</p>
