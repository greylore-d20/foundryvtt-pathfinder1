      <p>Everything about the target seems off-putting and grating, and everyone
      he meets is compelled to see the worst in him.  Whenever the target
      attempts a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform check, he must roll
      twice and take the lower result. Additionally, each creature he encounters
      has its initial attitude toward him reduced by one step (helpful becomes
      friendly, friendly becomes indifferent, and so on).</p>
