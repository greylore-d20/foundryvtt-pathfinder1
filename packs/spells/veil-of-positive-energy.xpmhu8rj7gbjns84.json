When under the effect of this spell, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC and a+2 sacred bonus on saves. Both of these bonuses apply only against attacks or effects created by undead creatures. You can dismiss this spell before its normal duration as a swift action on your turn to deal a number of points of positive energy damage equal to your level to all undead creatures within 5 feet of you.</p>"
