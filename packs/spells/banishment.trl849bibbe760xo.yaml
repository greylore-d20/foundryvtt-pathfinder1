      <p>A <i>banishment</i> spell is a more powerful version of the
      <i>dismissal</i> spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out
      of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level
      can be banished.</p><p>You can improve the spell's chance of success by
      presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears,
      or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1
      bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's  Spell
      Resistance (if any), and the saving throw DC increases by 2.</p><p>Certain
      rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of
      the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against
      Spell Resistance and increasing the save DC by 4).</p>
