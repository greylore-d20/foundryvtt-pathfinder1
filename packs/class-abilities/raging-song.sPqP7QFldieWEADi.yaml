  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to
      inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a
      skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his
      Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2
      additional rounds per day.<p>Starting a raging song is a standard action,
      but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot
      be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed,
      stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free
      action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard’s
      bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic
      performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces.<p>A raging song has
      audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be
      able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a
      20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this
      check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures
      are immune to raging songs.<p>If a raging song affects allies, when the
      skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally’s turn in which
      they can hear the raging song, the skald’s allies must decide whether to
      accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies
      automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song’s effects last
      for that ally’s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.<p>At
      7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a
      standard action.</p>

      <p>At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action
      instead.</p>
