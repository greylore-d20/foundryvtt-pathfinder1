    "shortDescription": "<p>Using a slashing motion with the spell's focus as part of the casting of <i><i>shadow</i> invasion</i>, you cut open a rift to the Plane of Shadow that fills a 30-foot area with <i>shadow</i>y energies. This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the <i>shadow</i> subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as <i>shadow</i> evocation) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of <i><i>shadow</i> invasion</i>.  In addition, the rift created by <i><i>shadow</i> invasion</i> has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When <i><i>shadow</i> invasion</i> is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 185) will be summoned under the caster's command (as per <i>summon monster</i> V). This chance is 5% for every full round that <i><i>shadow</i> invasion</i> was active. If the caster level of <i><i>shadow</i> invasion</i> is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutorB3 kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of <i><i>shadow</i> invasion</i> would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors.</p>",
