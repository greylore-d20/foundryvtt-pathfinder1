Whenever a creature attacks the cavalierâ€™s ward, or attempts to steal, sunder, or otherwise wrest control of it from the cavalier or his allies, the attacking creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier receives a +2 bonus on attacks of opportunity he makes against such creatures.</p>"
