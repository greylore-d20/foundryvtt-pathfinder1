  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By wrapping your hands and forearms in thin but tough hemp ropes and
      then soaking the makeshift gloves in water for weight and expansion, you
      can transform your fists into rock-hard weapons easily capable of killing
      in a fistfight. Each rope gauntlet takes a full minute to wrap and another
      minute to soak, but once applied the gauntlet can be worn for a day;
      removing a rope gauntlet takes 1 full round. When wearing rope gauntlets,
      you are considered armed and your attacks deal normal damage. If you are
      proficient with rope gauntlets, you may use the rough edges of the ropes
      to deal slashing damage rather than bludgeoning damage. Your fingers are
      mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in your hands while
      wearing rope gauntlets, but the constriction of the weapon at your
      knuckles gives you a -2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving
      your hands (such opening locks).</p>
