  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, as a standard action, the gunslinger can remove the
      broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long
      as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must
      have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the
      gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick
      clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action.</p>
