    value: >-
      <p><i>Mind fog</i> produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental
      resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the <i>mind fog</i> take a
      -10 penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves. (A creature that successfully
      saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even
      if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as
      they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is
      stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).</p><p>A
      moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+
      mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.</p><p>The fog is thin and does not
      significantly hamper vision.</p>
