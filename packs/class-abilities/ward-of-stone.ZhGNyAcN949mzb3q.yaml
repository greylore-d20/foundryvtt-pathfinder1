  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a
      ward of stone. The next time the warded creature is struck with a melee
      attack, it is treated as if it has DR 5/adamantine. This ward lasts for 1
      minute, after which it fades away if not already expended.</p>

      <p>At 8th and 16th levels, the ward lasts for one additional attack.</p>

      <p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24
      hours.</p>
