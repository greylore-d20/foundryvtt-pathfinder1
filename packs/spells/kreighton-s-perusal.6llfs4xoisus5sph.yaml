      <p>You gain a brief but incomplete understanding of one book's contents,
      equivalent to having skimmed its pages for 1 hour. This insight is not
      sufficient to translate unknown languages, decipher codes, or memorize
      text, but it does allow the caster to learn what topics the book
      discusses- invaluable to a Pathfinder who must make a snap decision when
      performing research or deciding whether or not to abscond with a volume.
      In addition, you instantly benefit from any bonuses or effects the book
      would normally grant to anyone who reads it for 1 hour (such as the
      bonuses gained from reading volumes of the <i>Pathfinder Chronicles</i>;
      see pages 26-27).</p>
