Regardless of what spell this functions as, it can transport only you, and both your departure and arrival spaces must be adjacent to a door or similar opening. Initially, this functions as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.99ihqk5u93smyy9x]{Jester's Jaunt}.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, the shaman can use this ability as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.ojwg1ki98tq8xyh9]{Dimension Door}.</p>\n<p>At 14th level, the shaman can use this ability as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.6x6epf4g5wgzl1gh]{Tree Stride} (treating all doors as generic coniferous trees).</p>\n<p>You can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and at 20th level.</p>"
