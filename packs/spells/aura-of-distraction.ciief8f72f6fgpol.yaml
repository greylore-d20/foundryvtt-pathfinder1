  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You emit an aura of subsonic noise and mental imagery that makes
    concentrating difficult. Any creature within the aura that fails its save
    takes a -5 penalty on concentration checks. A creature must attempt the Will
    save upon entering the area of the aura, and the penalty ends as soon as the
    creature leaves the aura. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to
    the effects of the aura for this casting of the spell, even if it leaves and
    reenters the aura, but must attempt another Will save each additional time
    this spell is cast. You are immune to your own <i>Aura of
    Distraction</i>.</p>
