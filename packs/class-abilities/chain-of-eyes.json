The mesmerist triggers chain of eyes by closing his eyes and concentrating on the implanted subject, allowing the mesmerist to see and hear everything the target experiences with her own senses of sight and hearing (including any special senses or magical effects).</p>\n<p>Once triggered, chain of eyes lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until the mesmerist shifts his field of vision back to himself as a free action. While viewing events from the targetâ€™s perspective, the mesmerist is flat-footed, even if he can see himself from another perspective.</p>"
