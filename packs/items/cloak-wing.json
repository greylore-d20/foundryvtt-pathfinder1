      "value": " \n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <em>PZO1121</em></p> \n<p>This strange piece of equipment only works for sylphs and similar creatures, whose light, airy bodies can be borne upon the winds. Looking like a fine silk traveler's cloak, a wing cloak is secretly reinforced with a series of wooden struts that, when locked into place, stretch the cloak's fabric into a rudimentary wing. Arranging the struts into a wing or reversing the change is a <em>move action</em>. When the cloak is shaped into a wing, the wearer can make a DC 15 <em>Fly</em> check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using <em>feather fall</em>. When falling, the wearer may make an additional DC 15 <em>Fly</em> check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet she falls. Readying and using a wing cloak requires two hands and provokes an <em>attack of opportunity</em>. A wing cloak has <em>hardness</em> 0 and 5 <em>hit points</em>. If the wing cloak is <em>broken</em>, the <em>Fly</em> DCs to use it increase by +10.</p> \n"
