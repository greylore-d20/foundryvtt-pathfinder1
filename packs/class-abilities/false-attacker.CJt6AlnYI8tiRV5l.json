      "value": "<p>Whenever the rogue strikes a foe from hiding, she can attempt a Bluff check as an immediate action (opposed by the target’s Sense Motive or Perception check, whichever has a higher bonus) before rolling damage to convince the foe that another creature was the attacker. This Bluff check applies the normal modifiers for convincing a creature of a falsehood, but can be accomplished with just physical trickery (a shared language is not required). If the Bluff is successful, and the rogue maintains concealment or cover, the rogue’s stealth does not end.</p>"
