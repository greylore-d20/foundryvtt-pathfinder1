    "shortDescription": "<p>You send out a magical message to any eldritch entities of a particular kind within a 100-mile radius, which can be delivered to up to 20 such creatures, starting with the nearest creatures until the limit has been met. This spell can't contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can't send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar <i>contact entity</i> spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don't know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn't  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn's overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like <i>scrying</i>, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.  Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4-1: Contact Entity on page 112. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire. Contacting certain types of creatures makes the spell chaotic, evil, or both, as indicated on the table.</p>",
