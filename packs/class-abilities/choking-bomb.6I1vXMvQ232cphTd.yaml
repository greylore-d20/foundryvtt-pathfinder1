  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever a character throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the
      resulting cloud must make a Fortitude save or become staggered by the
      choking black smoke for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal
      to 10 + 1/2 the character's class level + the character's Charisma
      modifier. The ninja can decide to create an ordinary smoke bomb or add
      poison to this smoke bomb as normal.</p>

      <p>The ninja must have the poison bomb ninja trick before selecting this
      trick.</p>
