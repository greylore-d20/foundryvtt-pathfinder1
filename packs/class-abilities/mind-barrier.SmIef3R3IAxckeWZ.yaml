  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a
      shield of mental energy around you that protects you from harm. The shield
      prevents a total of 2 points of damage per occultist level you possess. It
      lasts until the start of your next turn or until exhausted. For example,
      if you are 5th level, the mind barrier protects you from 10 points of
      damage; if you are hit by an attack that would deal 12 points of damage,
      the mind barrier is exhausted and you take 2 points of damage.</p>

      <p>You can activate this ability as an immediate action, but doing so
      costs 2 points of mental focus instead of 1.</p>
