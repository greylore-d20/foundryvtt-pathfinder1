  shortDescription: >-
    <p>The spell forces the target to believe that nothing in its hoard is
    missing or has been disturbed. This spell fools all the senses, convincing
    the target that its hoard feels and behaves as it should. Only if the target
    tries to use an item from this illusory hoard for some other purpose does it
    receive another saving throw to disbelieve the effects of the spell (a
    wizard trying to use an illusory wand or a dragon trying to unlock a door
    with an illusory key). For the purposes of this spell, a hoard is any amount
    of treasure that is too big to be carried by the treasure's owner without
    magical tools such as <i>bags of holding</i> or <i>portable holes</i>, such
    as a dragon's hoard, a king's treasury, a merchant's strongbox, or a thief's
    hidden cache.  The material component is any item worth 10 gp or more taken
    from the original hoard. This item is consumed by the spell.</p>
