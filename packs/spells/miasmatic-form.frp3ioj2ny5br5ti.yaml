      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{gaseous form}, except
      the target's vaporous body is dangerous to creatures that touch it. A
      creature can make a Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Intelligence modifier) on
      its turn to resist the vapors. When you cast this spell, you select one of
      the following options. <em>Stinking cloud</em>: The target's body
      nauseates creatures that fail their saving throws, as <em>stinking
      cloud</em> (Fortitude negates, see text). This form of the spell does not
      require a material component. <em>Poisonous cloud</em>: The target's body
      is deadly poison, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage to creatures
      that fail their saves (Fortitude halves). This form of the spell requires
      a material component.</p>
