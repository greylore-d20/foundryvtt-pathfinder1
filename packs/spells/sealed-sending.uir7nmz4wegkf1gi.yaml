    value: >-
      <p>You create a scroll bearing a message in any language you can speak,
      with a maximum length of 50 words. The scroll magically appears anywhere
      you have viewed at least once on the same plane of existence you are on
      now. When the spell ends or when the message has been read completely, the
      scroll disintegrates, leaving no trace. This spell cannot be detected,
      traced, or blocked by any spell of a lower level.</p>
