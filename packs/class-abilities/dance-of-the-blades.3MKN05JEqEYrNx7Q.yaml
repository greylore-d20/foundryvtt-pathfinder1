  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your base speed increases by 10 feet.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a metal weapon
      in any round in which you move at least 10 feet. This bonus increases by
      +1 at 11th level, and every four levels thereafter.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, as a move action, you can maneuver your weapon to create
      a shield of whirling steel around yourself until the start of your next
      turn; non-incorporeal melee and ranged attacks against you have a 20% miss
      chance while the shield is active.</p>

      <p>You must be wielding a metal weapon to use this ability.</p>
