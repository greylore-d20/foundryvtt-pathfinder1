    value: >-
      <p>A ray of sickly greenish-gray negative energy issues forth from the
      palm of your hand. Make a ranged touch attack against the target. A
      creature hit by this spell is wracked by painful spasms as its muscles and
      sinews wither and twist. The subject takes 1d4 points of Dexterity and
      Strength damage per 3 caster levels you possess (maximum 5d4 each). This
      spell cannot reduce an ability score below 1. A successful Fortitude save
      halves the damage.</p>
