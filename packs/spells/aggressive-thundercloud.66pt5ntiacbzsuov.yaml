    value: >-
      <p>A crackling, spherical storm cloud flies in whichever direction you
      point and deals electricity damage to those it strikes. It has a fly speed
      of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. If it enters a space that
      contains a creature, the storm stops moving for the round and deals 3d6
      points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex
      save negates that damage. It provides concealment (20% miss chance) to
      anything within it, and its flickering light illuminates the same area a
      candle would.</p><p>The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (as
      a move action for you); otherwise, it stays at rest and crackles with
      lightning. It can be moved by wind effects and counts as a Small creature
      for the purpose of determining how winds affect it. The sphere has no
      physical substance and cannot exert any force on corporeal creatures or
      objects. It disperses if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>
