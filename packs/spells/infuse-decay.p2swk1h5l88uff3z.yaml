      <p>This spell functions as per <i>imbue with spell ability</i>, except it
      can only target corporeal undead creatures, and can only transfer touch
      spells. The number and level of spells the subject can be granted depends
      on the undead creature's Hit Dice; even multiple castings of <i>infuse
      decay</i> can't exceed this limit. </p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>HD
      of Undead</th><th>Touch Spells Infused</th></tr><tr><td>5 or
      lower</td><td>One 1st-level spell</td></tr><tr><td>6-10</td><td>One or two
      1st-level spells</td></tr><tr><td>11 or higher</td><td>One or two
      1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell</td></tr></tbody></table> Once
      you cast <i>infuse decay</i>, you can't prepare a new 4th-level spell to
      replace it (see <i>imbue with spell ability</i> on page 299 of the
      <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> for further details). The infused
      spell is automatically triggered the next time the undead creature makes a
      successful touch attack or attack with a natural weapon. An intelligent
      undead can choose not to trigger the spell on a hit. Only one infused
      spell can be triggered per attack. An intelligent undead can choose which
      spell to trigger if it has more than one infused spell. A nonintelligent
      undead triggers a random spell when it hits with a natural weapon. Only
      one spell can be triggered per round, regardless of the number of attacks
      the undead makes.<p></p>
