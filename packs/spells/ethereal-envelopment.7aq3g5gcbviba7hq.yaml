    value: >-
      <p>This spell is similar to <i>ethereal envelope</i>, but it allows you to
      shunt an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and seal it there within
      a cocoon of misty ethereal fibers. If the target fails its save, it's
      forced into a cataleptic meditative state as if unconscious. However, each
      round at the end of its turn, it can attempt a Will save to awaken itself
      from this meditation. Once the target awakens, it is considered pinned,
      treating your caster level as your CMB and your CMD as 10 + your caster
      level + your ability modifier for your primary spellcasting ability score.
      A successful grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check leaves
      the creature grappled rather than pinned but doesn't allow it to escape.
      However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the
      <i>ethereal envelope</i> spell description.  If the creature breaks free
      of the <i>ethereal envelopment</i> or  you dismiss the spell, the target
      is returned to its prior location on the Material Plane, as described for
      <i>ethereal envelope</i>, but if the target is conscious at the time, it
      doesn't spend a round asleep or staggered.</p>
