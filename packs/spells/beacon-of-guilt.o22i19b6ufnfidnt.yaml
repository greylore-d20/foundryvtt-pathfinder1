    value: >-
      <p>You place an invisible ward upon an object that is triggered the first
      time a creature tries to move the object from its current location. The
      next creature to touch the object is cursed to become obvious  to everyone
      around it. The creature must succeed at a Will save or be surrounded in an
      aura of twinkling red light that functions as <i>faerie fire</i> (spell
      resistance applies). The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled,
      but a <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>,
      <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell can remove it.</p>
