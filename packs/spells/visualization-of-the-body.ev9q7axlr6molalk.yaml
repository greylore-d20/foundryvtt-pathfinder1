    value: >-
      <p>You focus your mind on one aspect of your body, aligning the energies
      within your body to enhance that element. Choose a single physical ability
      score (Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength). If you choose Strength or
      Dexterity, you gain a +5 bonus on skill checks associated with that
      ability score. If you choose Constitution, your maximum and current hit
      points increase by an amount equal to your Hit Dice.  At any time during
      the spell's duration, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as an
      immediate action in order to gain a one-time physical enhancement
      associated with the  ability score you chose to visualize, as detailed
      below. After you do so, the spell ends. <br /><b>Constitution</b>: You
      immediately regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your total
      character level. <br /><b>Dexterity</b>: You gain a +4 dodge bonus to your
      Armor Class for 3 rounds. <br /><b>Strength</b>: You gain a +6 bonus on
      all Strength checks to break objects and on checks to escape or establish
      grapples for 1 minute.</p>
