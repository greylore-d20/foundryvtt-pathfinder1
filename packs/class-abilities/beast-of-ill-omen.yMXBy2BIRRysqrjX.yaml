  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch imbues her familiar with strange magic, putting a minor curse
      upon the next enemy to see it. The enemy must make a Will save or be
      affected by @Compendium[pf1.spells.3etxlex8u32g0hrx]{Bane} (caster level
      equal to the witch's level). The witch can use this hex on her familiar at
      a range of up to 60 feet. The affected enemy must be no more than 60 feet
      from the familiar to trigger the effect; seeing the familiar from a
      greater distance has no effect (though if the enemy and familiar approach
      to within 60 feet of each other, the hex takes effect). The bane affects
      the closest creature to the familiar (ties affect the creature with the
      highest initiative score). Whether or not the target's save is successful,
      the creature cannot be the target of the bane effect for 1 day (later uses
      of this hex ignore that creature when determining who is affected).</p>
