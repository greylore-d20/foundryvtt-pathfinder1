  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You amplify your natural stench special ability-its save DC increases
      by 2, and creatures that fail their saving throws against your stench
      become nauseated rather than sickened. If your stench ability normally
      causes a creature to become nauseated (such as with the foul stench
      ability), the radius of your stench doubles instead. This spell has no
      effect if you don't possess the stench special ability.</p>
