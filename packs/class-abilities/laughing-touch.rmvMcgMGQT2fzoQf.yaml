  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, you can cause a creature to burst out laughing for 1
      round as a melee touch attack. A laughing creature can only take a move
      action but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been affected
      by laughing touch, it is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You can use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Charisma</em>
      modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
