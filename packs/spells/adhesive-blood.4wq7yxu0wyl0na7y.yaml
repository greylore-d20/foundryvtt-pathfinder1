      <p>Your blood thickens to becomes a glue-like substance upon contact with
      air. A piercing or slashing weapon that deals hit point damage to you is
      stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save. A creature can
      pry off a stuck weapon on its turn as a standard action with a successful
      Strength check against the spell's DC. Strong alcohol or universal solvent
      dissolves the adhesive. The glue breaks down 5 rounds after you die, or
      when the duration ends. This glue has no while underwater or in
      environments that lack air.</p>
