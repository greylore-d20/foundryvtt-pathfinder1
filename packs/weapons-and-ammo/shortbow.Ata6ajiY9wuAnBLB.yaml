  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A shortbow is made up of one piece of wood about 3 feet in length. You
      need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a
      shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it
      to damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high
      Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite
      shortbow, but not a regular shortbow. A shortbow fires arrows.</p>
