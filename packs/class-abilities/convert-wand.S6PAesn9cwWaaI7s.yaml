    value: >-
      <p>An arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a full-round
      action to convert one wand that is in her possession into a wand of a cure
      spell with the same spell level and caster level (a cure spell is any
      spell with “cure” in its name). For example, she could convert a <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=stone%20shape">wand
      of stone shape</a> into a <a
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=cure%20serious%20wounds">wand
      of cure serious wounds</a>. This alteration lasts for 1 minute, after
      which the wand reverts to its original function. Charges expended while
      the wand was altered are still expended when it reverts.</p>
