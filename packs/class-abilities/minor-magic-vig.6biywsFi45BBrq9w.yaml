    value: >-
      <p>A vigilante with this talent selects one of the following spells lists:
      bard, cleric, druid, psychic, shaman, sorcerer/wizard, or witch. Once this
      decision is made, the selection cannot be changed. The vigilante gains the
      ability to cast a 0-level spell from the selected spell list. This spell
      can be cast two times per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level
      for this ability is equal to the vigilante’s level. The save DC for this
      spell is equal to 10 + the vigilante’s Intelligence modifier (for psychic,
      sorcerer/wizard, and witch spells), Wisdom (for cleric, druid, and shaman
      spells), or Charisma (for bard spells).</p>
