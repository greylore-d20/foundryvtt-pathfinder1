      <p>An overwhelming feeling of loss overcomes the targets, and their
      allies' words sound bleak and hollow. Regardless of actual allegiances,
      affected creatures no longer count as allies for other creatures and
      always count as enemies for the purposes of abilities, effects, and spells
      that differentiate between allies and enemies, such as flanking or spells
      such as <i>bane</i> or <i>bless</i>. Allies of an affected creature must
      succeed at a melee touch attack to affect the subject with touch spells,
      and an affected creature cannot voluntarily fail a saving throw even if
      the effect is harmless (such as <i>cure light</i> wounds). An affected
      creature still counts as her own ally and can target herself with
      abilities, effects, and spells normally.</p>
