  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell sends a spellbook into a random but safe location on the
      Ethereal Plane, where it remains indefinitely. When you cast this spell,
      the target spellbook dissolves into quickly fading lines of energy and
      runes that reflect all of the spells stored within. Thereafter, you can
      retrieve the spellbook by concentrating as a standard action, causing it
      to reappear in your hands. You cannot cast this spell on another spellbook
      if you currently have a spellbook in the Ethereal Plane. No other
      creatures or objects accompany the spellbook you send away, and the
      duration of any spells currently affecting the spellbook continue
      normally.</p>
