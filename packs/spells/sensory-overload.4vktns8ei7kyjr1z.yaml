  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You overload the target creature's senses, making it difficult for the
      target to concentrate. For the duration of the effect, the target must
      succeed at a Will save at the same DC as the original effect to perform
      any standard or full-round action. On a failure,  the creature loses the
      action that triggered the saving throw. If successful, the creature is
      able to take the action, but this spell effect is not negated.</p>
