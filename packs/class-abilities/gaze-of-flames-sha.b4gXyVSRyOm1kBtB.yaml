  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman sees through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty as long as
      there is enough light to otherwise allow her to see normally. At 7th
      level, the shaman can gaze through any source of flame within 10 feet per
      shaman level, as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.6kmkxepwgsbta6ui]{clairvoyance}. The shaman
      can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level,
      but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
