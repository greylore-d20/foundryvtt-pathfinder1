  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can create a barrier of lava to protect you for 1
      round as a standard action. Choose one edge of your space. That edge is
      treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total
      cover from attacks that pass through this edge, and you gain the benefits
      of fire shield (warm shield) while adjacent to the lava shield. You can
      dismiss the lava shield as a free action, and it disappears immediately if
      you leave your space. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day
      equal to half your wizard level.</p>
