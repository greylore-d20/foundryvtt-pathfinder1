    value: >-
      <p>As a swift action, you can subtly alter the color of your scales,
      blending them with the surrounding environment. While under the effect of
      this power, you gain concealment from creatures more than 10 feet away
      (attacks have a 20% miss chance), and total concealment from creatures
      more than 40 feet away (attacks have a 50% miss chance). You can use this
      ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Copycat power of the Trickery Domain.</p>
