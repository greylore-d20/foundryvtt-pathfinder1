  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target weapons and any ammunition they fire make no sound as part
      of their normal functions as a weapon. For instance, a firearm's firing
      would not make an explosive sound, but if you  cast this spell on a
      creature's bite attack, it would not prevent it from vocalizing from its
      mouth. The first time a creature is struck by a weapon affected by this
      spell, it must succeed at a Will save (SR applies to this effect) or it
      becomes unable to make noise louder than a whisper (Perception DC 10 to
      hear) whether vocally or by other means for the duration of the effect.
      Because the creature can still whisper, this doesn't interfere with verbal
      spell components. Whether it succeeds or fails its saving throw, the
      creature is immune to further effects from this casting of <i>quieting
      weapons</i>.</p>
