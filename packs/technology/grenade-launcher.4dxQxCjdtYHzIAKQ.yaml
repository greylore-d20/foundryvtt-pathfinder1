      launcher is a bulky weapon that can fire any grenade a great distance.
      Grenades propelled by a launcher can be set to detonate upon impact or at
      the start of the wielder's next turn. A grenade launcher requires charges
      to fire, but unless the weapon is also loaded with a grenade, any charges
      that are consumed are wasted. A grenade launcher can hold up to 5 grenades
      at a time. Loading a single grenade into a grenade launcher is a move
      action.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 28;
