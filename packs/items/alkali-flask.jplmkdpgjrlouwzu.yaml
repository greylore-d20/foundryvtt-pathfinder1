    value: >-
      <p>This flask of caustic liquid reacts with an <em>ooze's</em>
      <em>natural</em> acids. You can throw an alkali flask as a <em>splash
      weapon</em> with a range increment of 10 feet. Against non-ooze creatures,
      an alkali flask functions as a normal flask of acid. Against
      <em>oozes</em> and other acid-based creatures, the alkali flask inflicts
      double damage.</p>
