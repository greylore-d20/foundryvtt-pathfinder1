  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can create a wooden club, quarterstaff, longspear, shortspear, or
      spear that lasts for 1 minute for every oracle level you possess. This
      weapon is appropriate for your size. You are considered proficient with
      the weapon. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your
      grasp.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the weapon is considered masterwork.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the weapon gains a +1
      enhancement bonus.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, the weapon gains the keen weapon property (or the
      equivalent increase to its critical threat range, if it is a bludgeoning
      weapon).</p>

      <p>You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Charisma modifier.</p>
