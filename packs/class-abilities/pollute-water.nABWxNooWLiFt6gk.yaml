      <p>The witch can corrupt bodies of water with foul energies. This
      functions as the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.0p3L0HtL5ClqZKEi]{blight hex}, except
      it affects only either an area of standing water or a creature with the
      aquatic or water subtype. A creature of any type that drinks water from a
      polluted area must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become nauseated
      for 1d3 rounds and afflicted as if blighted with the blight hex
      curse.</p><p>A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to
      the effects of polluted water from this area for 24 hours.</p><p>Polluted
      water does not quench thirst.</p>
