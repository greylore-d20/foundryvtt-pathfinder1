If the  bolt impacts anything before it reaches a distance of 30 feet, it  deals 1d8 points of damage. Between 30 and 60 feet away, the  flechettes deploy, dealing piercing damage to every creature  and object within a 30-foot-cone burst. After 60 feet, the  flechettes lose momentum and fall harmlessly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>  Separate attack rolls must be made against each target hit by  the burst. Light ballista flechettes deal 2d8 points of damage,  while heavy ballista flechettes deal 3d8 points. Additionally, any  winged creature hit by flechettes has several holes punched in  its wings, and has its fly speed reduced by 10 feet. The creature  takes a -4 penalty on Fly checks until the damage is healed.</p>"
