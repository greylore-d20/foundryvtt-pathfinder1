  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon drinking an extract created with this formulae, you make a
      significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all
      bombs you create and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on
      your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to
      modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae
      with the word "bomb admixture" in its title) active at a time. If you
      drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end
      and the new one becomes active.</p><p>When you throw a bomb and hit a
      direct target, it creates an invisible cubical prison composed of a solid
      Wall of Force.</p><p>The prison is as large as the splash area of the bomb
      that you threw, and traps any creature that is entirely inside the
      area.</p><p>Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless any
      creature within the splash radius is too big to fit inside, in which case
      the effect automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral
      travel provide means for escape, but the force walls extend into the
      Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.</p><p>Like a Wall of Force, the
      cage created by the caging bomb admixture resists dispel magic, although a
      mage's disjunction still functions. The walls of the cage can be damaged
      by spells as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys
      the cage. The walls of this cage can be damaged by weapons and
      supernatural abilities, but the cage has a hardness of 20 and a number of
      hit points equal to 20 per alchemist level.</p><p>Contact with a sphere of
      annihilation or a rod of cancellation instantly destroys this
      cage.</p><p>When using caging bomb admixture, an alchemist can only have
      one cage in effect at a time. If the alchemist throws another bomb during
      the duration of caging bomb admixture, any other cage created by the
      earlier admixture ends, and a new one is created. When the duration of the
      caging bomb admixture ends, so does any remaining cage created by this
      admixture's effect.</p>
