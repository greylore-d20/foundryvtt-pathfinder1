Locate <i>gate</i> detects only spells or effects with a permanent or ongoing duration, not instantaneous effects like <i>dimension door</i> or <i>teleport</i>.  Locate <i>gate</i> can be blocked by spells like <i>nondetection</i>, if the effect originates from a specific object or creature. However, spell effects can't likewise be warded. For example, ring <i>gate</i>s are a specific object, but a permanent <i><i>teleport</i>ation circle</i> is not (the surface in which it's inscribed doesn't count). Locate <i>gate</i> isn't blocked by lead, water, or other physical environmental conditions, but it is blocked by any intervening area that is dimensionally warded (such as by <i>dimensional lock</i> or forbiddance).</p>",
