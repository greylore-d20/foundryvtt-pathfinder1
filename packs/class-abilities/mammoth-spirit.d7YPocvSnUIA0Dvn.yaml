  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>A shaman who selects the mammoth spirit is abnormally tall and
      stocky, with thick shaggy hair. When she uses a special ability of this
      spirit, her muscles ripple and flex, and her stature seems even greater
      than before. At times, particularly when she uses her most powerful
      abilities, a ghostly image of a mammoth may seem to rise around her as a
      visible aura of ghostly power.</em><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells:</b>

      appears more primal and prehistoric than an ordinary animal of its kind.
      It gains a +2 inherent bonus to its Strength score. The spirit animal
      loses this bonus when it manifests as a megafauna companion from the true
      spirit ability.</p>
