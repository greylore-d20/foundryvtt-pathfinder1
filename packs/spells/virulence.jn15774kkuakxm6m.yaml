      <p>All living creatures within the area of effect, including yourself,
      must immediately attempt a saving throw with a -2 penalty against any and
      all diseases they have contracted, even if the onset time has not yet
      elapsed. On a failed saving throw, the affliction has its usual effect. A
      successful save does not count toward curing the affliction.</p>
