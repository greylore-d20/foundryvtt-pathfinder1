      <p>A kobold who chews and swallows this alchemically treated piece of coal
      (a <em>full-round action</em>) can make one <em>breath weapon</em> attack
      during the next minute. If the kobold fails to make a breath attack before
      this minute expires, it is <em>sickened</em> for 1 hour. Other
      <em>humanoid</em> creatures that eat alchemical coal are <em>sickened</em>
      for 1 hour (though certain other creatures may be able to use them, at the
      GM's discretion). Creatures that are immune to <em>poison</em> are immune
      to the <em>sickened</em> effect. The type of <em>breath weapon</em>
      depends on the type of alchemical coal that is chewed by the
      kobold.</p><p><em>Blinding Cinders</em>: This jagged bit of dusty red coal
      allows a kobold to breathe a 30-foot line of coarse cinders. The
      <em>breath weapon</em> deals 1d6 points of fire damage and blinds
      creatures in the area for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at a DC 15
      <em>Reflex</em> saving throw takes half damage and is not
      <em>blinded</em>.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft
