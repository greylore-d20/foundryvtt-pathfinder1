      "value": "<p><b>Book of Puzzles</b> Each book contains 10 puzzles made to test the mind and stir the intellect. Solving a single puzzle requires at least an hour and a successful DC 10 <em>Intelligence</em> check, though every 5 points by which you exceed the check reduces the amount of time you need to solve the puzzle by 10 minutes (to a minimum of 10 minutes to solve an individual puzzle). Once you solve a puzzle, for the next 24 hours you can choose to roll twice on a single <em>Disable Device</em>, <em>Knowledge</em>, or <em>Sense Motive</em> skill check and take the higher result. Once all the puzzles are solved, the book is useless, though you can purchase another puzzle <em>book</em> with different puzzles. <b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb. <b>Source</b> <em>PZO1129</em></p>"
