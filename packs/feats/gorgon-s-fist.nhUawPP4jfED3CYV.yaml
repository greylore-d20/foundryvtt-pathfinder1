      <i>With one well-placed blow, you leave your target reeling.</i>

      <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

      <p>Improved Unarmed Strike, Scorpion Style, base attack bonus +6.</p>

      <p><b>Benefits</b></p>

      <p>As a standard action, make a single unarmed melee attack against a foe
      whose speed is reduced (such as from Scorpion Style). If the attack hits,
      you deal damage normally and the target is staggered until the end of your
      next turn unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your
      character level + your Wis modifier). This feat has no effect on targets
      that are staggered.</p>
