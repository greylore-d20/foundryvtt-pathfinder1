      "value": "<p>Survival in the Mana Wastes between the nations of Nex and Geb can depend heavily on locating sufficient magical equipment, which sometimes involves stealing power from a wand or scroll to power a more necessary one. As a full-round action, a rogue with this talent can use two potions, two wands, or two scrolls. Each item is expended or loses a charge as if used normally. The rogue chooses to gain the magical effect of one, but calculates its effects using the caster level of the other. The rogue must still succeed at a Use Magic Device check to operate scrolls or wands unless some other ability allows him to do so, but makes only one skill check to operate both items.</p>"
