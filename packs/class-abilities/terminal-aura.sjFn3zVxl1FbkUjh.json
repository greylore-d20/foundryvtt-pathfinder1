      "value": "<p>You gain an aura with a 10-foot radius; any creature within that has fewer than 0 hit points but is stable must succeed at a Will save or be affected by the spell @Compendium[pf1.spells.n390v9tbwxya1tz4]{Bleed}. A dying creature within range of this aura does not receive a Constitution check to stabilize unless it succeeds at a Will save, but it can still be healed as normal. A creature with fast healing or regeneration must also succeed at a Will save every round or that ability does not function for 1 round. You can suppress and resume this aura as a free action.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>"
