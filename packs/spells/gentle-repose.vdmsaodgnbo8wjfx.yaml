  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay.
    Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from
    the dead (see <i>raise dead</i>). Days spent under the influence of this
    spell don't count against the time limit.</p><p>Additionally, this spell
    makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less
    unpleasant.</p><p>The spell also works on severed body parts and the
    like.</p>
