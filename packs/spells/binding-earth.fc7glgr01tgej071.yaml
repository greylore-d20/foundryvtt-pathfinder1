  description:
    value: >-
      <p>If the target of this spell fails its Fortitude save, areas of earth
      and stone floor act as a snapping quagmire that pulls the target down and
      damages it if it attempts to move through such terrain.  If the target is
      a creature, it treats all areas of earth and stone it moves through as
      difficult terrain. Furthermore, for each 5 feet a creature moves through
      such areas, it takes 1d6 points of damage. Creatures with a burrow speed
      or the earth glide ability are unaffected by <i>binding earth</i>.  If
      cast on an unattended object resting on an area of stone or earth, the
      stone or earth warps and wraps around it, pulling it firmly to the ground.
      A DC 15 Strength check is required to pull the object free from snapping
      earth or stone.</p>
