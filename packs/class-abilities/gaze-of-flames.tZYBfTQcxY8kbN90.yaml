    value: >-
      <p>You can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty as long as the
      light is sufficient to allow you to see normally.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, you can gaze through any source of flame within 10 feet
      per oracle level, as if using clairvoyance.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your
      oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
