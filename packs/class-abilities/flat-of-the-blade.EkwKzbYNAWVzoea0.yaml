  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, the cavalier of the order of the blue rose gains the
      ability to moderate his attacks in order to take an enemy alive. He no
      longer takes a â€“4 penalty when attacking with a lethal weapon to deal
      nonlethal damage. When dealing nonlethal damage, the cavalier receives a
      +2 bonus on damage rolls. When the cavalier makes use of this ability, he
      must attempt to subdue his target without killing it; dealing lethal
      damage after using this ability, or allowing his allies to kill the
      target, is considered a violation of his edicts.</p>
