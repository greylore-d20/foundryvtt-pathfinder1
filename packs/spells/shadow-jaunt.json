    "shortDescription": "<p>You instantly travel between shadows to a point within range, though line of sight is not necessary. You leave a shadowy image of yourself in your former location and are wrapped in shadow at your destination; you can attempt a Stealth check as a free action to hide in your new location. Creatures that fail opposed Perception checks typically aren't aware that you are no longer at your former location unless they are familiar with this spell and identify the effects. Any attack on your former location causes the shadows to disperse, allowing any creature that can see your former location to immediately notice your disappearance. In addition, for 1 round, the envelope of shadow around you grants you concealment (20% miss chance). This spell doesn't function if there are no shadows within 5 feet of your starting location, and you can't travel through your own shadow. If you choose a destination that has no shadows, you appear from the shadow closest to your destination that's within the spell's range (this could be your starting location if there are no other shadows within the spell's range).</p>",
