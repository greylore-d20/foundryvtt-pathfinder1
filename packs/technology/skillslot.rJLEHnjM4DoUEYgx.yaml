      1</p><h3>Description</h3><p>A skillslot is implanted into the target's
      brain, leaving a small port at the base of the skull. This port is covered
      with a flap of skin when not in use. Once installed, a skillslot has no
      effect until a skillchip is inserted into the port (see page 52 for
      information on the various forms of available skillchips.) An inserted
      skillchip enhances the user's ability in the skill encoded on the chip;
      the magnitude to which the skill is enhanced depends on the power of the
      skillchip. This does not grant ranks in the associated skill. It takes 10
      minutes for a skillchip to adjust itself to a new skillslot; during this
      time, the user takes a -2 penalty on all skill checks as distracting
      sensations flood his mind. When a skillchip is removed, its benefits end
      immediately, but the wearer suffers no ill
      effects.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 28;
