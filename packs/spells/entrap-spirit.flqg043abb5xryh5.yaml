      <p>You trap the target in the mirror used as the spell's focus. The target
      cannot be affected by any means while inside the mirror. If the mirror is
      destroyed, any incorporeal creature within is immediately freed and any
      haunt within returns to its original location. Creatures that assumed
      incorporeal form through a spell or other means remain incorporeal while
      trapped, even if the duration of the effect that rendered them incorporeal
      expires. If your focus mirror belonged to the target, the target takes a
      -2 penalty on its saving throw.</p>
