      <p><b>Acquired/Inherited Template</b> Acquired<br><b>Simple Template</b>
      No<br><b>Usable with Summons</b> No<p>A hell engine is a construct fueled
      by an infernal contract, bypassing the complex magic and craftsmanship
      needed to animate a golem or similar engine of destruction. Artificers who
      lack the skill or magical aptitude to craft constructs on their own may be
      tempted to use the power of Hell to make up for their shortcomings,
      surrendering their souls for the chance to see their masterpieces brought
      to horrifying life.<p>Although a hell engine lacks the creativity and
      cunning of a true devil, contracting an infernal construct grants certain
      advantages over a bound outsider. A hell engine’s mindless neutrality
      renders it resistant to anarchic or holy attacks that would cripple a
      devil, making it a valuable tool against celestial and chaotic forces.
      Combined with the construct’s ability to banish hostile outsiders and
      replace them with additional devils, these war machines earn a
      distinguished place as shock troops in infernal armies and guardians of
      Hell’s most secure vaults.<p>“Hell engine” is an acquired template that
      can be added to any nonchaotic, nongood construct with no Intelligence
      score. A hell engine uses all the base creature’s statistics and special
      abilities except as noted here.<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Base creature’s
      CR + 1.<p><b>Alignment:</b> Always neutral. However, a hell engine
      radiates a moderate aura of law and evil as if it were a lawful evil
      outsider.<p><b>Senses:</b> A hell engine gains the see in darkness
      ability. In addition, the hell engine can see through the hellfire cloud
      created by its breath weapon without penalty, ignoring any cover or
      concealment bonuses it provides.<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A hell
      engine gains fire resistance 30. If the base creature has immunity to
      magic, it gains the following change:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dispel%20evil">Dispel
      evil</a> or <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=dispel%20law">dispel
      law</a> drives the hell engine back 30 feet and deals 2d12 points of
      damage to it (no save).</li>

      </ul>

      <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> A hell engine gains the following
      weakness.<p><em>Contract Powered (Ex):</em> A hell engine draws power from
      the infernal contract that animates it. A hell engine cannot attack the
      devil that drafted its contract, the mortal who signed it, or any creature
      holding an original copy of the contract. Spells cast by the devil that
      wrote the contract or its mortal signatory automatically bypass any spell
      resistance or immunity to magic the hell engine has. If both copies of the
      contract are destroyed, the hell engine ceases to function until a new one
      is created.<p><b>Special Attacks:</b> A hell engine gains the
      following.<p><em>Breath Weapon (Su)</em>: As a standard action once every
      1d4+1 rounds, a hell engine can exhale a churning cloud of hellfire in an
      adjacent space equal to its own size. This hellfire persists for 1 round;
      each creature within the area when the hell engine creates it (as well as
      any creature that passes through the cloud until the start of the hell
      engine’s next turn) takes 1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of
      unholy damage per 2 Hit Dice of the base creature. A creature can attempt
      a Reflex save (DC 10 + half the base creature’s HD) for half damage. The
      hellfire cloud also provides concealment as if from a <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=fog%20cloud">fog
      cloud</a> spell.<p>The hell engine can use this breath weapon in addition
      to any breath weapon the base creature has, and it can use up to two
      breath weapons simultaneously as a full-round action. Simultaneous breath
      weapons both fill the area of either the hellfire breath weapon or base
      creature’s breath weapon (hell engine’s choice). If the base creature’s
      breath weapon deals fire damage, a simultaneous breath weapon converts
      half of that damage into unholy damage.<p><em>Banishing Strike (Su):</em>
      Three times per day as an immediate action, the hell engine can force an
      extraplanar or summoned creature it hits to attempt a Will save (DC = 10 +
      half the base creature’s HD); on a failure, the target is forced back to
      its original plane as if by a <a
      href="https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=dismissal">dismissal</a>
      spell.<p><em>Redirect Summons (Sp): </em>Within 1 minute of successfully
      using its banishing strike ability, a hell engine can redirect its planar
      energy to summon a devil as an immediate action with a 100% chance of
      success. The summoned devil remains for 1 hour. A hell engine can have
      only one summoned devil at a time. The hell engine’s Hit Dice determines
      the most powerful kind of devil it can summon and the effective spell
      level of this ability, according to the following table.<br><br></p>
