    value: >-
      <p>Knowledge is the stepping stone of both truth and power. The members of
      this order devote themselves to the preservation of knowledge. Most would
      protect written knowledge at all costs, but there are members that believe
      there is such thing as knowledge too dangerous to be allowed to exist, and
      seek to destroy it.<p><b>Edicts:</b> An order of the tome cavalier must
      protect written knowledge (or at least approved knowledge) at all costs.
      Some are also devoted to the destruction of proscribed knowledge and are
      equally zealous in the pursuit of its destruction. Most of these cavaliers
      believe that the preservation of a written work is more important than a
      single life, even their own, as it ensures future generations benefit from
      its wisdom.<p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever an order of the tome cavalier
      issues a challenge, he receives a +2 bonus on all saving throws against
      spells or spell-like abilities cast by the subject of his challenge and a
      +2 bonus on all Bluff and Sense motive checks involving the subject of his
      challenge.<p><b>Skills:</b> An order of the tome cavalier adds Knowledge
      (arcana), Knowledge (religion), and Linguistics to his list of class
      skills. Furthermore, he can use Linguistics untrained. If he has ranks in
      Linguistics, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier
      level (minimum +1).</p>
