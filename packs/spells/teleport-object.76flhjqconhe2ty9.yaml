      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.ptqu8gtrujxsvwy1]{teleport}, except that
      it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be
      teleported.</p><p>If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant
      location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the
      object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved.
      A successful targeted <em>dispel magic</em> spell cast on that point
      brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.</p>
