    value: >-
      <p>This spell induces a hallucinogenic reality in the mind of your target.
      Surfaces seem to swim, and movement constantly distracts the eye. The
      target takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws, caster level checks,
      Intelligence-based skill checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks.</p>
