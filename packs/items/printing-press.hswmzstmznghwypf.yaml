      <p>A hand-cranked press uses a plate on which all of the text on a page is
      carved in reverse. Changing the plate is a simple process, but creating a
      new one is expensive and labor-intensive. The press prints one page at a
      time, at a rate of about five pages per minute. A stationer then needs to
      cut and trim the pages and bind the book.</p>

      <h4>Quill, Poisoned</h4>

      <p>DESCRIPTION</p>

      <p>This long pen is made from a delicate feather and has a thin and
      unusually long nib. The quill is typically white in color, though
      variations that are crimson, onyx, or some combination of these colors
      also exist. A hidden compartment inside the nib allows the quill to hold a
      single dose of <em>poison</em> that is dispensable with a small squeeze.
      Additionally, this provides a +2 <em>circumstance bonus</em> on
      <em>Sleight of Hand</em> checks to conceal poisons inside the quill. If
      this quill is used with vector ink, it increases the DC of a poison mixed
      with the ink by 1.</p>

      <p>This quill can be used as a small shiv to deal 1d3 points of damage and
      deliver its contained poison. However, because of the fragility of the
      nib, using the quill in this way destroys it.</p>
