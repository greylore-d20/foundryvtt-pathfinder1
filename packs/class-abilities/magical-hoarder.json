      "value": "<p>At 13th level, whenever a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell intended to benefit its targets, you can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool as an immediate action to include yourself as a target of that spell. If the creature is not your ally, you must be able to clearly see the spell’s effects and you must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the spell’s level) to identify the spell before using this ability.</p>\n<p>If you are not within the normal range of the spell, then you must spend 1 additional point from your phrenic pool to use this ability.</p>\n<p>If the spell has a range of personal, then you must instead spend 2 additional phrenic points from your pool to use this ability.</p>\n<p>This ability does not affect spells with an instantaneous or permanent duration.</p>"
