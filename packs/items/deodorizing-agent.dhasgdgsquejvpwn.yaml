      <p>Coating a creature in a vial of this milky, odorless substance takes 1
      minute and renders it scentless for 1d3 hours. Creatures that rely on
      <em>scent</em> for locating creatures do not gain the benefit of this
      ability against a creature affected by a dose of deodorizing agent.</p>
