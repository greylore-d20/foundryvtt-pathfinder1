      <p><em>You can weave pieces of beasts into your magic
      items.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.tD76K8QGco9scT0r]{Craft Wondrous Item},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.WOny1lHnaikwNDzH]{Grisly Ornament},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.rpsKqlUNGhqRV97z]{Harvest
      Parts}.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you use the Grisly
      Ornament feat, you are able to permanently integrate one ornament you have
      crafted using the harvested creature parts into a wondrous item. The
      ornament grants no ongoing benefits, but once per day you can activate an
      integrated ornament as a free action to gain its full benefits for 1
      minute. You can integrate an ornament into a wondrous item (or replace an
      item’s existing ornament) by spending 8 hours of work and 100 gp × the
      creature’s CR.</p>
