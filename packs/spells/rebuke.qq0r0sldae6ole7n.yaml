  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Your wrathful words cause physical harm to your enemies.</p><p>Your
    enemies take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) and
    are staggered for 1 round. Half of this damage is sonic damage, but the
    other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject
    to being reduced by resistance to sonic-based attacks. is especially
    devastating to foes who worship your god, inflicting 1d6 points of damage
    per caster level (maximum 10d6) and stunning them for 1d4 rounds. A
    successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the staggering or
    stunning effect.</p><p>Enemies do not need to hear a <i>rebuke</i> to be
    harmed by it, but it is negated by magical silence.</p>
