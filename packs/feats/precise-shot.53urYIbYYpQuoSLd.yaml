      <p><em>You are adept at firing ranged attacks into
      melee.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.8rsFtye3PwM6CKli]{Point-Blank
      Shot}.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You can shoot or throw ranged
      weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard -4
      penalty on your attack roll.</p><h3>Combat Trick</h3><p>As a standard
      action, you can spend 2 stamina points and make a ranged attack against a
      foe engaged in melee with an ally. If the attack hits, it deals no damage,
      but your ally gains your choice of either a +2 bonus on her next attack
      roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent's
      next attack. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>
