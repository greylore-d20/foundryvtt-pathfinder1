      <p>You anoint a wounded creature with devil's blood or unholy water,
      giving it fast healing 1. This ability cannot repair damage caused by
      silver weapons, good-aligned weapons, or spells or effects with the good
      descriptor. The target detects as an evil creature for the duration of the
      spell and can sense the evil of the magic, though this has no long-term
      effect on the target's alignment.</p>
