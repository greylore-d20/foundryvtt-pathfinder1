  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Your target's vision becomes impaired as if the light level were one step
    lower, treating bright light as normal light, normal light as dim light, and
    dim light as darkness. In addition, the subject gains no benefit from
    darkvision, low-light vision, or the see in darkness ability. The subject
    gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist the blind or dazzled condition
    caused by bright light (such as flare). <i>Remove blindness/deafness</i>
    dispels <i>night blindness</i>.</p>
