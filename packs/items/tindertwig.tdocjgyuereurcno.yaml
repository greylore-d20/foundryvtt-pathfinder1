  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites
      when struck against a rough surface (a move action). Creating a flame with
      a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with tinder and a flint
      and steel or magnifying glass. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a
      standard action rather than a full-round action, and lighting any other
      fire with one is at least a standard action. A tindertwig burns for 1d2
      rounds and sheds light as a candle. Tindertwigs are waterproof, but must
      be dried before you can strike them.</p>
