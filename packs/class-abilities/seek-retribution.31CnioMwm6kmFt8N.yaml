    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, once per day after receiving a request for aid from a
      legal authority or an aggrieved party regarding the breaking of an oath,
      whenever the cavalier encounters the oath-breaking creature, he can choose
      to vehemently exact retribution. As a swift action, the cavalier can grant
      himself a competence bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on all attack
      rolls, weapon damage rolls, and opposed checks against the oathbreaking
      creature. These bonuses last for 1 round per level.</p>
