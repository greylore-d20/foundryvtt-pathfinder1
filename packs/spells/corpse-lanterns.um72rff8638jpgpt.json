    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell functions as <i>dancing lights</i>, except it summons up to four spheres of light, each of which glows a sickly pale green. These <i>corpse lanterns</i> shed dim light in a 20-foot radius, and do not increase the light level in areas of normal light or bright light. In dim or normal light, the radiance of <i>corpse lanterns</i> provides a strange contrast, giving all creatures in the area a -5 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, the hue interferes with illusion (pattern) spells, giving all creatures in the illuminated area a +2 bonus on any saving throws against such spells. Unlike <i>dancing lights</i>, you may have more than one <i>corpse lanterns</i> spell active at a time, but you may only move one set in any given round.</p><p>Moving the <i>corpse lanterns</i> does not require concentration.</p><p><i>Corpse lanterns</i> can be made permanent on an area with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of at least 11th level for the cost of 7,500 gp.</p>"
