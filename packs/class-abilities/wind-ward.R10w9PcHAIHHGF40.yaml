  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman can touch a willing creature (including herself ) and grants
      a ward of wind. This ward lasts for a number of rounds equal to the
      shamanâ€™s level. When a warded creature is attacked with an arrow, ray, or
      other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack suffers a
      20% miss chance.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the ward lasts for 1 minute for every level the shaman
      possesses.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the miss chance increases to 50%.</p>

      <p>Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for
      24 hours.</p>
