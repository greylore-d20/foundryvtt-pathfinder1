      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Handheld magnets are relatively weak and are mainly used to detect or
      pull iron, mithral, or adamantine at a short range. They are not powerful
      enough to tug metal over significant distances or aid in disarming
      creatures wielding metal weapons. This hand-sized horseshoe magnet can
      lift up to a 3-pound iron weight.</p>
