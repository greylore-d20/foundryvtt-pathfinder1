  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, as an <em>immediate action</em>, you can sacrifice 1 hit
      point in exchange for a +1 <em>sacred bonus</em> on the next damage roll,
      saving throw, or skill check you make. This bonus only applies as long as
      you use it by or during your next turnâ€”otherwise both your sacrificed hit
      point and the bonus are wasted. You can use this ability a number of times
      per day equal to 3 +  your <em>Charisma</em> modifier.</p>
