    value: >-
      <p>The rogue can search a creature, object, or area in half as much time
      as normal. If her Perception check would normally require a full-round
      action or less, it becomes one step shorter along the following
      progression: full-round action, standard action, move action, swift
      action, immediate action. This talent has no effect on Perception checks
      that are attempted as free actions or Perception checks that donâ€™t require
      an action.</p>
