  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Legend claims runelords used this spell to literally benefit from
    drinking the tears of their captured foes. This spell turns nonmagic
    liquids-including spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise
    contaminated drinks, tears, seawater, and similar fluids-into mead or wine
    of average quality. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or
    spoilage. Unholy water and similar liquids of significance are spoiled by
    <i>Tears to Wine</i>, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type
    or on magic potions.  Creatures that drink the mead or wine created by this
    spell become sharp-witted and clear-minded, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus
    on all Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks. This increases to a +5
    bonus at caster level 9th, and to +10 (the maximum) at caster level
    15th.</p>
