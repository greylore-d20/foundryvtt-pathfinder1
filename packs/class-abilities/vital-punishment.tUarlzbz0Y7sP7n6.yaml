    value: >-
      <p>The vigilante gains @Compendium[pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital
      Strike} as a bonus feat, though he does not have to meet the prerequisites
      for this feat. Once per round, before he makes an attack of opportunity,
      he can declare it to be a vital punishment. If the attack hits, the
      vigilante can apply the Vital Strike feat. The vigilante can apply the
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.DorPGQ2mifJbMKH8]{Improved Vital Strike} or
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.zKNk7a4XxXsygJ67]{Greater Vital Strike} feat as his
      vital punishment instead if he later gains those feats.</p>

      <p>A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent</p>
