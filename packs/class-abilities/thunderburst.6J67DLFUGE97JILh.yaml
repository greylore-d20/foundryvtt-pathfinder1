    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, you can create a blast of air accompanied by a
      loud peal of thunder. The blast has a range of 100 feet and has a 20-foot
      radius, increasing by 5 feet for every 4 oracle levels after 7th.
      Creatures in the area take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per oracle
      level and are deafened for 1 hour, with a Fortitude save resulting in half
      damage and no deafness.</p>

      <p>You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>

      <p>You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
      at 11th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>
