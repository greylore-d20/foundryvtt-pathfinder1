  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can force others to do your bidding. As a
      <em>standard action</em>, you attempt to dominate a creature as though
      using the @Compendium[pf1.spells.66s5qm8kwycgobce]{Dominate Monster}
      spell, except that the creature must have a number of <em>Hit Dice</em>
      equal to or less than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a
      <em>Will</em> <em>saving throw</em> each round to negate the effect. The
      DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your <em>Intelligence</em>
      modifier. You can dominate creatures for a number of rounds per day equal
      to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must
      concentrate as a <em>standard action</em> to maintain control over a
      dominated creature.</p>
