    value: >-
      <p>The alchemist gains the ability to create a fey mutagen, a mixture that
      lends him some of the grace and power of the First World. When imbibed, a
      fey mutagen grants a +2 alchemical bonus to the alchemist’s Dexterity and
      Charisma, a –2 penalty to his Strength, and DR 2/cold iron. This otherwise
      works like the standard mutagen class feature and interacts with other
      effects as though it were a mutagen.</p>
