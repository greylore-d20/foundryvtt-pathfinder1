  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Upon completing this spell, roll a single d20 and record the result. At
    any point during the duration of this spell, you may use that roll for a
    single ability check, attack roll, initiative check, saving throw, or skill
    check, using the recorded result in place of a roll. This spell cannot be
    used to replace a roll that has already been made; the recorded result must
    be used instead of a roll. Once you have used this recorded result or the
    duration of the spell ends, the spell's effect ends. You can't have more
    than one instance of <i>embrace destiny</i> active on you at the same
    time.</p>
