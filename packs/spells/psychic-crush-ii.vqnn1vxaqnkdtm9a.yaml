      <p>This functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.199pl2cgawz38smh]{psychic crush I}, but
      on a successful Fortitude save, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1
      point of damage per caster level. In addition, the target receives a +4
      circumstance bonus on the Fortitude save only if it is at full hit points;
      otherwise, it gains a +2 bonus if it has more than half its total hit
      points remaining. This spell can be undercast.</p>
