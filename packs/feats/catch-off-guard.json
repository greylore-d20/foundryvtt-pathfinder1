Unarmed opponents are flat-footed against any attacks you make with an improvised melee weapon.<br/><br/><b>Normal</b><br/>You take a -4 penalty on attack rolls made with an improvised weapon.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>When making an attack with an improvised weapon against an armed opponent, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, the target is considered flat-footed during that attack. An opponent who recognizes you and has seen you use Catch Off-Guard in this way is immune to this effect."
