      <p><b>Element</b> universal; <b>Type</b> form infusion; <b>Level</b> 2;
      <b>Burn</b> 2<br><b>Prerequisite</b> kinetic blade<br><b>Associated
      Blasts</b> any<br><b>Saving Throw</b> none</p>

      <p>You use your element’s power to instantly move 30 feet in any direction
      (even straight up), manifest a kinetic blade, and attack once. You gain a
      +2 bonus on the attack roll and take a –2 penalty to your AC until the
      start of your next turn. The movement doesn’t provoke attacks of
      opportunity, though activating blade rush does.</p>

      <p>If you have the kinetic whip infusion, you can manifest a kinetic whip
      instead of a kinetic blade at the end of your movement by increasing the
      burn cost of this infusion by 1.</p>

      <p>The blade or whip vanishes instantly after the rush.</p>
