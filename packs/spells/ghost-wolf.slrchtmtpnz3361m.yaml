      <p>This spell conjures a Large, quasi-real, wolflike creature made of
      roiling black smoke. It functions as <i>phantom steed</i>, except as noted
      above. In addition, the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature
      with fewer than 6 Hit Dice within 30 feet (except the ghost wolf â€˜s rider)
      must make a Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds (this is a
      mind-affecting fear effect). A creature that makes its Will save is
      unaffected by the steed's fear aura for 24 hours.  The ghost wolf may also
      be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the ghost wolf to
      attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 points of damage);
      unlike an animal mount, this does not require a Ride check or any
      training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only 1 round per level
      thereafter.</p>
