  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can heal and harm elemental beings. You gain
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.f5rgOsdDlseGr4o5]{Elemental Channel} (your choice of
      air, earth, fire, or water) as a bonus feat. You gain the cleric’s channel
      energy ability, as a cleric of your oracle level, but only to use
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.f5rgOsdDlseGr4o5]{Elemental Channel}. The DC for
      this effect is 10 + half your oracle level + your Charisma
      modifier.</p><p>At 5th, 10th, and 15th level, you gain
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.f5rgOsdDlseGr4o5]{Elemental Channel} with one of the
      remaining elemental subtypes as a bonus feat.</p><p>You can take other
      feats to add to this ability, such as
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.1HfwfBOSWtdxFQ2s]{Improved Channel}, but not feats
      that alter this ability, such as
      @Compendium[pf1.feats.ieww7CP6JK5pwtpg]{Alignment Channel}. This
      revelation’s effects do not stack with levels in other classes that grant
      the channel energy ability.</p>
