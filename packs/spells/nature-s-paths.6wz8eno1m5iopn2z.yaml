  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target instinctively knows the shortest, easiest, and fastest way
      through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the
      target treats any trackless terrain as though there were a trail or road,
      and any terrain with a road or trail as though there were a highway
      (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 171-172). Up to one creature per
      caster level traveling with the target can also benefit from the effect.
      The spell functions only outdoors and does not function in magically
      altered terrain.</p>
