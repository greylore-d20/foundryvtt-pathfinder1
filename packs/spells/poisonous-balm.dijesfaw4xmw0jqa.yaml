    value: >-
      <p>You mend the target's injuries, curing 3d8 hit points + 1 point per
      caster level (maximum +15) as <i>cure serious wounds</i>, but leaving its
      body laced with a subtle toxin that remains inert until you activate it. A
      target that decides to attempt the Will save and succeeds is healed for
      half (as <i>cure serious wounds</i>) and negates the toxin. Otherwise, you
      can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell as a standard action,
      at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of Strength damage per round
      for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target can attempt a
      Fortitude save each round to negate that round's damage and end the
      affliction. If you don't trigger the poison for 1 hour, the spell ends and
      leaves the target unharmed. <i>Detect poison</i> reveals an inert
      <i>poisonous balm</i> only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check
      against a DC equal to 15 + your caster level. Attempts to identify
      <i>poisonous balm</i> with a skill check incorrectly identify it as
      <i>cure serious wounds</i> (see the ruse descriptor on page 192). A fooled
      viewer mistakes <i>poisonous balm</i>'s aura as the lingering aura of an
      instantaneous effect.</p>
