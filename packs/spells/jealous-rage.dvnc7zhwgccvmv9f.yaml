    value: >-
      <p>You fill the target with a sense of entitled self-importance, making
      the subject unable to bear the indignity of another creature getting
      something that it doesn't have. Whenever an ally of the target receives a
      harmless spell or spell-like ability, beneficial supernatural effect, or
      assisting action (including the aid another action, first aid using the
      Heal skill, etc.) that doesn't also include the target, the target is
      driven into a murderous rage against either the producer of that effect or
      the nearest creature that benefited from that effect, whichever is closer.
      The target must attack that creature on its next turn. Any ability that
      deals lethal damage is considered an attack for this purpose. Once the
      target deals lethal damage to the object of his <i>jealous rage</i>, the
      compulsion to attack that creature ends.</p>
