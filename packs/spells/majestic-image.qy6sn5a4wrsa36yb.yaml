      bears your likeness, as if choosing a specific image with the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.nznqmwpavfediten]{enter image}. In
      addition to observing your surroundings, speaking, and manipulating the
      image you inhabit, however, you can converse with nearby creatures and use
      your normal social skills. You gain a +5 bonus on Bluff checks to tell
      lies and Diplomacy checks to make a request. You gain a +2 bonus on
      Intimidate checks and use the object's size to determine whether you gain
      a bonus or penalty on Intimidate checks for size.</p>
