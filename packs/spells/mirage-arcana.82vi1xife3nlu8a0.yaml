      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.a2y1yf0a4jy3610w]{hallucinatory terrain},
      except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other
      than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory
      elements.</p><p>Unlike <em>hallucinatory terrain</em>, the spell can alter
      the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still,
      it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the
      area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide
      themselves within a real location).</p>
