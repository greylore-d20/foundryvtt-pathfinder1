    value: >-
      <p>You compel the target creature to rise from its sleep as if
      sleepwalking and perform a course of activity (limited to a sentence or
      two). The spell takes effect immediately if the target is already asleep,
      or as soon as the target falls asleep if it is conscious. You can specify
      that the creature should wait before taking action when you give your
      instructions if you so choose. A sleeping creature doesn't get a save
      against this spell. The suggested activity must not cause the target to
      directly harm itself or others, but it doesn't need to be reasonable. For
      example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or
      poison its ally's rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de
      grace action against a sleeping ally. Instructions that cause direct harm
      prompt the target to awaken just prior to performing the action and the
      target experiences a vague memory of what it was supposed to do.  The
      target moves at its speed, but isn't capable of running or moving at a
      higher rate of speed. It moves in dark conditions as if it had darkvision
      and can perform most simple and skill-based actions, but it can't engage
      in combat, spellcasting, or actions that require significant cognitive
      awareness (like making complex decisions, solving puzzles, or using
      complicated magic items). If the creature takes any damage while
      sleepwalking, it must attempt a new saving throw. If it succeeds, the
      spell ends and the creature awakens. When the target completes the
      suggested course of activity, or when the spell ends or is dismissed, the
      target remains unconscious and returns to where it was sleeping and must
      be awoken normally. It retains no memory of what it did while unconscious
      (with the only exception described above).  Unlike the <i>sleepwalk</i>
      spell, attempts to use <i>sleepwalking suggestion</i> on a creature that
      is unconscious for any reason other than sleep automatically fail. A
      creature affected by <i>sleepwalking suggestion</i> is unaware it has been
      programmed to act in its sleep (unless awoken because it was about to
      cause harm).</p>
