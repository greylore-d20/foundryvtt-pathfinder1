  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By touching a weapon against the fang of a poisonous creature and
      casting this spell, you drain 1 dose of the creature's poison, which is
      magically applied to your weapon without risk of poisoning yourself. The
      poison remains on the weapon until either it strikes a creature, you touch
      the weapon, or you wipe off the poison. It otherwise functions exactly
      like a dose of a manufactured poison applied to a weapon. You can use this
      spell with natural as well as manufactured weapons. This spell does not
      prevent you from exposing yourself to the poison if you roll a natural 1
      on an attack roll while the poison is applied to your weapon.  The spell
      has no effect if the creature whose fang is touched is a summoned
      creature, if it has been dead for more than 1 minute, or if its poison has
      already been extracted from it.</p>
