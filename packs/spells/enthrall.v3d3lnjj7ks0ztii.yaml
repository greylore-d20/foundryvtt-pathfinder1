  shortDescription: >-
    <p>If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell
    to hold them enthralled. To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without
    interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their
    undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to
    have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell. Any
    potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets
    a +4 bonus on the saving throw. A target with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom
    score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude
    of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it
    opposes. The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1
    hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing
    and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance.
    Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save
    or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still
    applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing.
    If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you,
    they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by
    jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature
    with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to
    assist. The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma
    check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell. If
    any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly
    hostile act, the spell ends and the previously enthralled members become
    immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more HD or with a
    Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.</p>
