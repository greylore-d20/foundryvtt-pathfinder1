      Engine</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Resembling either large cauldrons or more
      traditional cannons, these firearms lob their ammunition in an arc in
      order to deliver their deadly payloads over troops or castle walls.
      Bombards are normally fired indirectly, but can also be fired as
      direct-fire siege engines. When they are used for direct fire, they take a
      -4 penalty on attack rolls and have their range increment halved, but do
      not have a minimum range. Like all firearms, bombards do not suffer
      mishaps, but instead have a misfire chance.</p><p><em>Light</em>: These
      bombards resemble cauldrons attached to swivels. Often they are mounted
      into the ground or into the stone of castle walls because of the mighty
      power of their recoil. The targeting DC of a light bombard is 15. A light
      bombard has a base misfire range of 1-2 (10 feet). Light bombards have a
      hardness of 10 and 70 hit points. Light bombard balls cost 30 gp each and
      weigh 25 pounds.</p><p><em>Standard</em>: These bombards feature the
      greatest diversity of forms. Many take the cauldron shape of the light
      bombard, but they may also take the forms of more traditional cannons,
      albeit featuring stabilizing mechanisms that allow them to fire at a much
      steeper incline. The targeting DC of a standard bombard is 20. A standard
      bombard has a misfire range of 1-2 (20 feet). Standard bombards have a
      hardness of 10 and 140 hit points. Standard bombard balls cost 35 gp each
      and weigh 30 pounds.</p><p><em>Heavy</em>: These massive siege engines are
      often fixed to positions on high hilltops or atop massive keeps, raining
      death down on a valley or strait. Often these firearms come in two pieces
      connected by a screw mechanism. The bombard is unscrewed to be loaded, and
      then the main part of the muzzle is screwed back on to the barrel section
      in order to be fired. Heavy bombards are too large and powerful to mount
      on vehicles. The targeting DC of a heavy bombard is 25. A heavy bombard
      has a misfire range of 1-2 (30 feet). Heavy bombards have a hardness of 10
      and 280 hit points. Heavy bombard balls cost 45 gp each and weigh 50
      pounds.</p>
