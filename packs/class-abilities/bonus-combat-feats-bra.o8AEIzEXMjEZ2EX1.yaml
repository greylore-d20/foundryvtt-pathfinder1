  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus
      combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These
      bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee
      attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus
      combat feat.<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a
      brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus
      combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the
      bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one
      that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other
      ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must
      choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus
      combat feat for the level.</p>
