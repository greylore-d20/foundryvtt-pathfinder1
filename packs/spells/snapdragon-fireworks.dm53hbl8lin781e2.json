    "shortDescription": "<p>A favorite display at halfling midsummer festivals, this spell lets you create fireworks in the shape of tiny dragons.</p><p>Once per round, as a move action, you may designate a target 5-foot-square within range and launch a pyrotechnic in that direction. The pyrotechnic takes a zigzag path from you to that square, always missing creatures and objects in its path, and detonates in that square with a bang and a colorful burst of fire and light. Creatures in the target square take 1d4 points of fire damage and are dazzled for 1 round (Reflex half, a successful save negates the dazzled condition).</p><p>Normally when this spell is used as part of a festival, the chosen target is high in the sky to increase visibility and protect observers.</p>"
