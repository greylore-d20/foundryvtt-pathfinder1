      <p>Saddles are used to support a rider or supplies on a
      mount.</p><p><strong>Pack Saddle</strong>: A pack saddle holds gear and
      supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can
      carry.</p><p><strong>Exotic Saddle</strong>: These saddles are designed
      for a variety of unusual mounts, each customized for a specific type of
      beast. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles, just as
      normal saddles do, and have the same traits.</p>
