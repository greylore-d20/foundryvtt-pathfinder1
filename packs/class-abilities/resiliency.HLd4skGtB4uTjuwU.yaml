    value: >-
      <p>Once per day, a rogue with this ability can gain a number of temporary
      hit points equal to the rogue's level. Activating this ability is an
      immediate action that can only be performed when she is brought to below 0
      hit points. This ability can be used to prevent her from dying. These
      temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If the rogue's hit points drop
      below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit points, she falls
      unconscious and is dying as normal.</p>
