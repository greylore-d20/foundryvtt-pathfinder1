      <p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that each
      creature within the radius of <i>Symbol of Exsanguination</i> begins to
      bleed uncontrollably and violently from their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth,
      as well as any existing open wounds. Creatures that failed their saving
      throws immediately take 1d6 points of bleed damage and are sickened as
      long as they continue to take bleed damage from the symbol.  While a DC 15
      Heal check or magical healing can end the bleed damage as normal, the
      bleed damage and sickened condition begin again each round so long as the
      creature begins its turn still within 60 feet of the symbol, including if
      the creature leaves the area and returns. Creatures that succeed at their
      saving throw suffer no ill effects from the symbol, even if they leave its
      area and return.  Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>Symbol of
      Exsanguination</i> has no hit point limit on the creatures it can affect.
      Once triggered, a <i>Symbol of Exsanguination</i> remains active for 10
      minutes per caster level.  Magic traps such as <i>Symbol of
      Exsanguination</i> are hard to detect and disable. While any character can
      use Perception to find a symbol, only a character who has the trapfinding
      class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is
      equal to 25 + spell level, or 28 (27 for a bloodrager) for <i>Symbol of
      Exsanguination</i>.</p>
