      <p>This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque
      smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a
      <em>fog cloud</em> spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind
      dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and
      the smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute.</p><h3>Alchemical Power
