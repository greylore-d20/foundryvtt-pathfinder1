      <p>In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose.
      Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests
      preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people.
      Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine
      work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of
      their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that
      inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and
      influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities,
      clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve,
      with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth,
      and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric
      are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of
      allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.</p>

      <p><b>Role</b>: More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities
      in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true
      strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities,
      whether to increase their own and their allies’ prowess in battle, to vex
      their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As
      their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their
      worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a
      specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept
      worthy of devotion—such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge—free of a
      deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to
      selecting a specific deity.)</p>

      <p><b>Alignment</b>: A cleric’s alignment must be within one step of her
      deity’s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.</p>

      <p><b>Hit Die</b>: d8</p>

      <p><b>Starting Wealth</b>: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.</p>

      <h2>Class Skills</h2>
