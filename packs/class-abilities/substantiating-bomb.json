      "value": "<p>Your bombs are infused with ectoplasm and a longing for life, lending ethereal creatures a measure of substance. You can throw a bomb that inflicts no damage but instead creates a 10-foot-radius cloud of fog that functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.g33euis7yi9pwddy]{Fog Cloud}&nbsp;and lasts for 1 round per alchemist level. Incorporeal creatures that pass through this cloud become partially solid, taking half damage from nonmagic attacks and full damage from magic weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities. This effect lasts for the duration of the smoke cloud, even if the incorporeal creature moves outside the cloudâ€™s area. A creature affected by the cloud can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the substantiating effects of this bomb.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be 10th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
