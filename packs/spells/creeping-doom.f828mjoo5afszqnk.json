    "shortDescription": "<p>This spell summons four massive swarms of biting and stinging insects. These swarms appear adjacent to one another, but can be directed to move independently. Treat these swarms as centipede swarms with the following adjustments. The swarms have 60 hit points each and deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm attack. The save to resist their poison and distraction effects is equal to the save DC of this spell. Creatures caught in multiple swarms only take damage and make saves once.</p><p>You may summon the swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. As a standard action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any target within 100 feet of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet).</p>"
