      <p>These odd looking, egg-shaped contraptions have cleverly placed fins
      that improve bombs' accuracy. <em>Goblin</em> <em>alchemists</em> use
      these special containers to make their bombs more accurate when thrown
      long distances. Using a bomb launcher when throwing a bomb increases the
      bomb's range increment to 30 feet (or increases the range increment of a
      bomb with the rocket bomb discovery to 70 feet). Bomb launchers are
      destroyed when used.</p>
