      "value": "<p>A bard of 9th level or higher can use his performance to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally while using this performance (up to a maximum of four at 18th level). To inspire greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus <em>Hit Dice</em> (d10s), the commensurate number of <em>temporary hit points</em> (apply the targetâ€™s <em>Constitution</em> modifier, if any, to these bonus <em>Hit Dice</em>), a +2 <em>competence bonus</em> on <em>attack rolls</em>, and a +1 <em>competence bonus</em> on <em>Fortitude</em> saves. The bonus <em>Hit Dice</em> count as regular <em>Hit Dice</em> for determining the effect of spells that are <em>Hit Dice</em> dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.</p>"
