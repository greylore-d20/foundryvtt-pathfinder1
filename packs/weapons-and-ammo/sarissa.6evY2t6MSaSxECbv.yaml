  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spearlike weapon is about 15 feet long. Its unwieldy length is
      counterbalanced by a heavy brass base. A sarissa provides extended
      reach-tripling your reach rather than doubling it. A Medium wielder would
      threaten spaces 10 to 15 feet away, but not adjacent squares or squares 5
      to 10 feet away (as with a typical reach weapon). Because of its great
      length and weight, a sarissa can be used to attack foes in only one
      direction each round. You must select a cone each round before you make
      any attacks with the sarissa. The weapon threatens only foes within this
      cone and within its extended reach. You can't change the area you threaten
      with the sarissa until your next turn. While you carry the sarissa pointed
      upward (typical for overland movement), you threaten only squares in the
      sarissa's reach in a cone pointed upward.</p>
