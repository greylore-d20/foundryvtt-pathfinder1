    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, as a <em>standard action</em>, you can impose either
      starvation or thirst upon a living creature you can see within 30 feet.
      This requires the creature to make a <em>Constitution</em> check each
      round (DC 10 + 1 for each previous check) to avoid taking 1d6 points of
      <em>nonlethal damage</em>. The creature must continue to make these checks
      until, as a <em>full-round action</em>, it quenches its thirst or sates
      its hunger (see starvation and thirst). You can use this ability a number
      of times per day equal to 3 + your <em>Charisma</em> modifier, but can
      only apply it once every 24 hours to any given creature. Creatures that do
      not need to eat are immune to this effect.</p>
