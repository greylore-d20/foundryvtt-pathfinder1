      <p>This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about
      6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called
      oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely
      nonmagical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can
      use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into
      other planes of existence, as with the spell
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.g66w32kdup1f43bp]{Scrying}<em> </em>(Will DC 16
      negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to
      resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use. Certain crystal
      balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on
      the target viewed.</p>

      <p>While looking through the crystal ball, you see things as if affected
      by @Compendium[pf1.spells.nokru6mxk9p3r513]{See Invisibility}.</p>
