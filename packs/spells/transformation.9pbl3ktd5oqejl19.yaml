      <p>You become a fighting machine- stronger, tougher, faster, and more
      skilled in combat. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and you
      can't cast spells, even from magic items.</p><p>You gain a +4 enhancement
      bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus
      to AC, a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and proficiency with all
      simple and martial weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character
      level (which may give you multiple attacks).</p><p>You lose your
      spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or
      spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your
      class list.</p>
