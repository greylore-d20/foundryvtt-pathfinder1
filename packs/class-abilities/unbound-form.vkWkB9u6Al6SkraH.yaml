    value: >-
      <p>The shaman can assume a variety of forms, as per
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.t44p3oeq43jwcgwg]{Polymorph, Greater}, for 1 minute
      per day per shaman level. The minutes need not be consecutive, but they
      must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>

      <p>When she assumes these forms, some element of the new shape always sets
      it apart from a typical specimen, such as strangely colored eyes, limbs
      that bend in unusual ways, or a slimy coating of mucus over the flesh.</p>
