  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This potent spell invokes the same sort of magical devastation that
      created the Mana Wastes so long ago- albeit on a much more localized (and
      thankfully temporary) scale. Within the area you choose to affect with
      <i>spellscar</i>, the terrain takes on a strange pale hue, as if colors
      were muted. Periodically, ripples of vibrant color wriggle through the
      terrain. Within this area, any spell, spell-like ability, or magic item
      activation automatically triggers a primal magic event-a spellcaster can
      avoid triggering such an event by making a concentration check (DC 15 +
      twice the spell's level), but non-spellcasters who activate magic items
      have no such option.</p><p>You gain a +4 insight bonus on concentration
      checks made to avoid triggering primal magic events while within a
      <i>spellscar</i> you have created, and if you do trigger a primal magic
      event, you may roll d% twice and pick which of the two results you wish to
      have occur.</p>
