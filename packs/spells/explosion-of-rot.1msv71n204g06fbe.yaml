    value: >-
      <p>You call forth a burst of decay that ravages all creatures in the area.
      Even nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead crumble or wither
      in this malignant eruption of rotting energy. Creatures in the area of
      effect take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are
      staggered for 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw
      takes half damage and negates the staggered effect. Plant creatures are
      particularly susceptible to this rotting effect; a plant creature caught
      in the burst takes a -2 penalty on the saving throw and takes 1 extra
      point of damage per die.</p>
