    value: >-
      <p>You imbue an object with psychic energy. The <i>Node of Blasting</i>
      unleashes a mental blast when a creature with a mind touches the object,
      dealing 6d6 points of damage to the creature touching the object and
      causing the creature to be staggered for 1 minute. A successful saving
      throw halves the damage and negates the staggered condition.  Magic traps
      such as <i>Node of Blasting</i> are hard to detect and disable. A
      character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to
      thwart <i>Node of Blasting</i>. The DCs to find a <i>Node of Blasting</i>
      using Perception and to disable it using Disable  Device are both equal to
      25 + the spell's level. Additionally, a creature with the read aura occult
      skill unlock (see page 197) can attempt the same Perception check to
      notice a <i>Node of Blasting</i>.</p>
