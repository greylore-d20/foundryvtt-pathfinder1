      <p>With this blessing, you call your allies to move forth and empower them
      to conquer and become victorious. Each round for the duration of this
      spell, each of your allies can choose one of the following bonuses for
      that round at the beginning of its turn (their
      choice).</p><ul><li><p>Increase its <em>speed</em> by 30
      feet.</p></li><li><p>Stand up as a swift action without provoking an
      attack of opportunity.</p></li><li><p>Make one extra attack as part of a
      full attack action, using its highest base attack
      bonus.</p></li><li><p>Gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus
      to AC and Reflex saves.</p></li></ul><p>Cast a single spell of 2nd level
      or lower as if it were an enlarged, extended, silent, or still
      spell.</p><p>These effects are not cumulative with similar effects, such
      as those provided by <em>haste</em> or a <em>speed</em> weapon, nor do
      they actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second
      spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round. <em>Blessing of
      Fervor</em> does not stack with <em>haste</em>.</p>
