  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You and your mount form a perfect synergy that endows both of you with
      advantages based upon how far you travel each round. For every 5 feet your
      mount moves in a given round, you gain a +1 competence bonus on Ride
      checks and both you and your mount gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls
      made with weapons or natural attacks for 1 round. For instance, if your
      mount traveled 40 feet in a round, you would gain a +8 bonus on Ride
      checks and you and your mount would both gain a +8 bonus on damage rolls
      for 1 round, to a maximum bonus equal to your caster level. You must be
      mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you dismount, get knocked
      off, or take any other action that separates you from your mount, the
      spell immediately ends.</p>
