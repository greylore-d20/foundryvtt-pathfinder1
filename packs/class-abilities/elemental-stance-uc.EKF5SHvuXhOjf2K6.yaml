    value: >-
      <p>When the barbarian adopts this stance, she chooses an energy type
      (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). Her melee attacks deal 1 additional
      point of damage of the chosen type.</p>

      <p>This damage increases to 1d6 points at 8th level.</p>

      <p>At 12th level, the barbarian’s critical hits deal an additional 1d10
      points of energy damage of the same type (2d10 if the weapon deals ×3
      damage on a critical hit, 3d10 if the weapon deals ×4 damage on a critical
      hit).</p>

      <p>This is a stance rage power.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>
