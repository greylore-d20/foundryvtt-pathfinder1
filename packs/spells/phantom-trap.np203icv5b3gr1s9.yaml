  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to
      anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism
      or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any
      character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling
      trap detection, is certain a real trap exists.</p><p>Of course, the effect
      is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is "sprung"; its primary
      purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious
      time.</p><p>If another <i>phantom trap</i> is active within 50 feet when
      the spell is cast, the casting fails.</p>
