  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions as <i>resurrection</i> except that instead of
    recalling the dead soul to life, the spell calls a shadow demon with the
    advanced simple template (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 67, 294) to possess
    the body. If you fail to overcome the subject's spell resistance, the
    subject's soul can negate the calling and gain the option to return to life
    (as <i>resurrection</i>) in the restored body. The possession otherwise
    functions (as possessionOA) except that the subject's soul is not present to
    resist. When <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i> ends or the demon is removed
    from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but
    soulless (like that created by clone). If the soul hasn't been returned to
    life already, it has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still
    lives (as <i>resurrection</i>). If the body was killed, the demon is sent
    back to the Abyss but the subject remains dead.  Attempts to identify
    <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i> with a skill check incorrectly identify it
    as <i>resurrection</i> (see the ruse descriptor on page 192). A fooled
    viewer mistakes <i>false</i> <i>resurrection</i>'s aura as the lingering
    aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.</p>
