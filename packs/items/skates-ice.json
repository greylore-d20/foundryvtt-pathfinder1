Wearing ice skates allows you to move on ice at normal speed with a successful DC 5 <em>Acrobatics</em> check (including running and charging), but your movement is reduced to half speed on all other terrain. Donning or removing an ice skate is a <em>full-round action</em>. Skating with only one is possible, but the DC of the <em>Acrobatics</em> check rises to 15.</p> \n"
