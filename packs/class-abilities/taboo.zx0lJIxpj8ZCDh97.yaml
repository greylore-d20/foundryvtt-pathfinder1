  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a creature touches you or strikes you with a melee attack, you can
      activate this power as an immediate action. That creature takes a â€“1
      penalty on saving throws for 1 minute. This penalty increases by 1 for
      every 5 levels you possess. When you use this ability, you lose your
      resistance bonus granted by the Protection domain for 1 minute. You can
      use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Resistant Touch power of the Protection
      Domain.</p>
