      <p>This spell functions as
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.3bw76h8kazudq45e]{mental barrier III},
      but if you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 25%
      chance that the additional damage is negated (as <em>light</em>
      fortification). This does not stack with similar effects that negate the
      additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you
      are immune to <em>mind thrust I</em> and <em>II</em>, and you take half
      damage from <em>mind thrust III</em>, <em>IV</em>, and <em>V</em> (reduced
      to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be
      undercast.</p>
