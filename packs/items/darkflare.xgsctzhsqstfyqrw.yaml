    value: >-
      <p>Created by the <em>drow</em>-hunters, this alchemical flare explodes in
      black sparks 1 round after lighting. Any creature in the same square as a
      darkflare when it explodes must make a DC 15 <em>Fortitude</em> save or be
      unable to see with <em>darkvision</em> for 1d10 rounds. Affected creatures
      can still see in normal light with no penalty. A darkflare has no effect
      on creatures without <em>darkvision</em>.</p><p>The DC to create a
      darkflare with <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) is 20.</p>
