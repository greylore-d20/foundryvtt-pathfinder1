      <p>This spell functions as <i>mending</i>, except that it repairs 1d6
      points of damage per level when cast on an object or construct creature
      (maximum 5d6).</p><p><i>Make whole</i> can fix destroyed magic items (at 0
      hit points or less), and restores the magic properties of the item if your
      caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges (such
      as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be
      repaired in this way. When <i>make whole</i> is used on a construct
      creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not
      allow spell resistance.</p>
