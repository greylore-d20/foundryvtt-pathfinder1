      <p>You plunge the targets' minds into a veiled immersive mindscape (see
      page 235) of your own design. You can affect any number of creatures whose
      combined total Hit Dice do not exceed 30. A creature of 10 HD or fewer
      gets no saving throw, one of 11-15 HD escapes after 10 minutes per level
      you possess on a successful save, and a creature of 16 HD or more negates
      the effect on a successful save. Given time, the bodies of creatures 
      whose minds are trapped in a <i>microcosm</i> can die of starvation and
      thirst without care. Creatures can neither escape from nor enter a
      <i>microcosm</i>, even via a <i>mindscape door</i>. <i>Microcosm</i> can
      be ended only by <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>.  Creatures inside a
      <i>microcosm</i> can be affected by mind-affecting effects targeted
      against their real bodies. However, they perceive them as natural events
      within their inner mindscape. Multiple creatures affected by the same
      <i>microcosm</i> can interact with one another within the mindscape.</p>
