  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You summon a chain from another realm, causing it to burst out from the
    ground and strike a target within the spell's range. You can have the chain
    either make a melee attack (dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage) or
    attempt a trip combat maneuver against the target. The chain uses your base
    attack bonus plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier as its attack
    bonus and combat maneuver bonus. On a successful hit or combat maneuver
    check, the target must attempt a Will save. If it fails its save, the
    creature is shaken for 1d4 rounds. You summon one additional chain every 3
    levels after 1st, for a total of two chains at 4th level, three at 7th
    level, and a maximum of four at 10th level. Multiple chains can attack the
    same target but the shaken effect doesn't stack.</p>
