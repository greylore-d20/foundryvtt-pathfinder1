  shortDescription: >-
    <p>With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to clear a path
    ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a windstorm (<i>Core
    Rulebook</i> 439). During the first round of the spell, the winds sweep the
    designated area clear of anything  of Small or smaller size, blowing it
    outward to the sides of the spell's effect (50% chance of landing on either
    side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though all other
    creatures are subject to the wind's effects. On the second and all later
    rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a wind wall. If
    the effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds create a
    channel up to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid. On your turn as a
    move action, you can move the effect of this spell, either rotating it at
    one of its ends up to 45 degrees, or moving it up to 50 feet in line with
    its current orientation (toward you or away from you).</p>
