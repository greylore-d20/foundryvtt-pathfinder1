    value: >-
      <p>A blast of furnace-hot wind blasts downward, inflicting 4d6 fire damage
      +1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knocking them
      prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the fire damage and negates
      being knocked prone. Flying creatures forced into the ground by the
      powerful downdraft take damage as if they fell unless they make a DC 15
      Fly check, in which case they remain at their original altitude.</p><p>Any
      creature that takes damage from a <i>sirocco</i> becomes fatigued (or
      exhausted, if already fatigued, such as from a previous round of exposure
      to a <i>sirocco</i> spell). Creatures with the water subtype take a -4
      penalty on all saving throws against this spell and take double normal
      damage.</p>
