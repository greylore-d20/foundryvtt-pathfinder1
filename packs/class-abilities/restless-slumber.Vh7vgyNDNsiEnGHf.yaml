  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to fall into a sleep riddled
      with nightmares. This functions as the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.ehQflQB4BXvEdHYh]{slumber
      hex}.</p><p>Additionally, the restless nature of the sleep causes the
      creature to violently toss and turn, dealing 1d10 points of damage to
      itself each turn. This damage does not wake the creature.</p><p>When it
      wakes, the creature’s addled state causes it to be confused for a number
      of rounds equal to half the witch’s level.</p><p>The witch must have the
      slumber hex to select this hex.</p>
