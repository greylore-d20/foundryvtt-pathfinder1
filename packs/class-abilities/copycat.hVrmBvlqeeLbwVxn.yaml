    value: >-
      <p>You can create an illusory double of yourself as a move action. This
      double functions as a single
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.4jsss37x0pplib8f]{Mirror Image} and lasts for a
      number of rounds equal to your cleric level, or until the illusory
      duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. You can have no more than one copycat
      at a time. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell. You
      can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom
      modifier.</p>
