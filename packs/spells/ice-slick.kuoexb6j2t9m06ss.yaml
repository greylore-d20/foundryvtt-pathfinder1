      <p>You create a blast of intense cold, coating all solid surfaces in the
      area with a thin coating of ice. Any creature in the area when the spell
      is cast takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level
      (maximum +10) and falls prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save
      take half damage and don't fall prone. Spell resistance applies to this
      initial effect.  A creature can walk within or through the area of ice at
      half its normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure by
      4 or less means the creature can't move that round (and must succeed at a
      Reflex save or fall); failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the
      Acrobatics skill on page 87 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> for
      details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to attempt
      this check.  A 5-foot square of ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points. The
      ice is an instantaneous effect, but persists as nonmagical ice. Under
      temperate conditions, the ice lasts 1 minute per level. In tropical
      environments, it might last only half as long. In cold environments where
      ice and snow persist without melting, it could last indefinitely.</p>
