      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This clay container resembles a fuse grenadeUE, but trails a pulley and
      wire rather than a fuse. Pulling the cord (a move action) sparks a flint
      and steel within the device, causing the grenade to explode. The pull cord
      can be attached to a door or drawer within 5 feet, or strung across a
      5-foot square, causing the grenade to detonate when its tripwire is
      disturbed. A pull-cord grenade cannot be reused.<p>This can be crafted
      with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check.</p>
