  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 12th level, whenever a cavalier declares a challenge, his target
      must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within
      the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a â€“2 penalty to its AC from
      attacks made by anyone other than the cavalier.</p>
