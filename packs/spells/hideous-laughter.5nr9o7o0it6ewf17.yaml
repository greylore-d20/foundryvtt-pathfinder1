    value: >-
      <p>This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It
      collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can
      take no actions while laughing, but is not considered
      helpless.</p><p>After the spell ends, it can act normally. On the
      creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.
      This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity.</p><p>If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not,
      the creature continues laughing for the entire duration.</p><p>A creature
      with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected.</p><p>A creature
      whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its
      saving throw, because humor doesn't "translate" well.</p>
