  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, as an immediate action, you can emit a 30-foot-radius
      aura of sanctification for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric
      level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Within this aura,
      effects that are specifically harmful to good-aligned creatures are
      inverted so that they no longer harm good creatures and instead harm evil
      creatures. Similarly, effects that are specifically beneficial to evil
      creatures instead become beneficial only to good creatures.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Holy Lance power of the Good Domain</p>
