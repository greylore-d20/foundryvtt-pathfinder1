  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With a touch, you cause a glowing rune to appear on a single weapon,
      granting that weapon the <i>flaming</i> property (and allowing it to cause
      an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit). If you are using
      the judgment class feature, your weapon gains the <i>flaming</i> burst
      property instead. The spell functions only for weapons that you wield. If
      the weapon leaves your hand for any reason, the spell effect ends. The
      effects of this spell do not stack with any existing <i>flaming</i> or
      <i>flaming</i> burst weapon property that the target weapon may already
      possess.</p>
