  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are able to tweak tiny variables affecting a creature's immediate
      future in order to grant the target a Bit of Luck at the right time. Roll
      a d20; once during the duration of <i>lucky number</i>, when the target
      creature rolls that result (regardless of what type of dice the target
      rolls), the creature has the option to either reroll the result or add a
      +2 luck bonus to the result. The creature must decide to use this ability
      before the success or failure of the original roll is known. A creature
      can have only one <i>lucky number</i> at a time. If <i>lucky number</i> is
      cast on a creature already affected by that spell, the new number replaces
      the previous one.</p>
