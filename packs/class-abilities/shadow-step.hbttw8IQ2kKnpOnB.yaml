  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, you can use this ability to walk through the Shadow Plane
      and reappear as a <em>standard action</em>. You can travel up to 30 feet
      per wizard level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or
      broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must be used in
      5-foot increments and does not provoke an <em>attack of opportunity</em>.
      Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when you arrive, you
      re-enter 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown splash weapons
      (see page 202 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). If this would place
      you in an occupied square, you instead arrive in the nearest safe
      location. When you arrive, you are cloaked in shadow and gain
      <em>concealment</em> as the <em>blur</em> spell for 1 round. You may bring
      other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of
      distance for each additional creature brought with you. They likewise
      re-enter off target (roll location for each creature) and are cloaked in
      shadow for 1 round.</p>
