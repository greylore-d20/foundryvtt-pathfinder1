  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Upon casting this spell, you keep your relative form, but you and your
    equipment become composed entirely of dust. While in this dust form, you
    take no penalties for squeezing, and can move through spaces as if you were
    a creature three size categories smaller without penalty. You are also
    considered incorporeal, though any nonmagical attack you make deals half
    damage (50%). Magic attacks are unaffected, and you can still use your magic
    items and other equipment as normal.  If the duration ends in a square that
    your normal space cannot occupy, you take 3d6 damage and are shunted to the
    nearest open space that you can normally occupy.</p>
