  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks. You may provide first aid to two
      people or treat two people for poison as a standard action (make a
      separate Heal check for each creature). When using the Heal skill to treat
      wounds from caltrops (and so on), treat deadly wounds, treat poison, treat
      disease, or treat long-term care, you may treat double the normal number
      of people you may treat at the same time. You may provide long-term care
      for yourself.</p>
