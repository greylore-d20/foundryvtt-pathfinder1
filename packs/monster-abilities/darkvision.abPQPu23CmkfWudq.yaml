    value: >-
      <p>A creature with darkvision can see in total darkness, usually to a
      range of 60 feet. Within this range, the creature can see as clearly as a
      sighted creature could see in an area of bright light. Darkvision is black
      and white only but otherwise like normal sight.</p><p><em>Format:</em>
