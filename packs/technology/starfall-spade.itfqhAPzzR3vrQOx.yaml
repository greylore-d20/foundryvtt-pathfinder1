      <strong>CL</strong> 7th</p><p>The Technic League produces these unusual
      weapons as signature tools for the guards of Starfall and the Palace of
      Fallen Stars. A Starfall spade is a <em>+1/+1 monk's
      spade</em><sup>UE</sup> and has a capacity of 10 charges. When the weapon
      strikes a foe, it automatically consumes a charge and deals an additional
      2 points of plasma damage (1 electricity, 1 fire) on that hit. Attack that
      miss don't consume charges. A crystal button on the shaft allows for a
      secondary attack: a beam of plasma that fires from the forked tip of the
      spade. This beam is a ranged touch attack that deals 4d6 points of plasma
      damage (half electricity, half fire) on a hit-it has a maximum range of 40
      feet with no range increment. Firing this plasma beam consumes 10
      charges.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 26;
