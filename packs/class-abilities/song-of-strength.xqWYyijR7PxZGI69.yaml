  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to
      superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this
      performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the
      skaldâ€™s level to a Strength check or Strength-based skill check.</p>
