    value: >-
      <p>Ninjas can act as bodyguards as well as assassins or spies; some
      mystically emulate the relationship between <em>kami</em> and their wards
      when protecting their charges. A ninja with this trick gains
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.JSPFo2fBkNlrtVqi]{Bodyguard} and as bonus
      feats, ignoring their prerequisites. When using In Harmâ€™s Way to intercept
      an attack, the ninja can spend 1 ki point to gains DR 10/cold iron and
      resistance 10 to acid, electricity, and fire for that attack.</p>
