    "shortDescription": "<p>You tap into your latent amphibian strengths, unlocking a short-lived physical talent. Armor or gear you are wearing adjusts to your new shape for the duration of the spell. When you cast <i>batrachian surge</i>, choose one of the following features to gain its associated benefits. You can have only one <i>batrachian surge</i> spell active on you at a time.  <b>Gills</b>: Your throat expands, and gill slits appear along your neck. You can breathe underwater.  <b>Leaping</b>: Your legs elongate and become especially muscular. You are always treated as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump, and you gain a competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump equal to your caster level.  <b>Swimming</b>: You grow a large tadpole tail, and your other limbs shrink slightly. You gain a swim speed equal to your base land speed.  <b>Tongue</b>: Your tongue extends to the length of your body. Increase your reach by 5 feet when delivering touch spells. This increased reach doesn't stack with any other spells or abilities that affect your reach.</p>",
