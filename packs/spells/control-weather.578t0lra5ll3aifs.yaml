    value: >-
      <p>You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast
      the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You
      can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area
      you are in. You can also use this spell to cause the weather in the area
      to become calm and normal for the season.</p> <table
      border="1"><tbody><tr><th>Season</th><th>Possible
      Weather</th></tr><tr><td>Spring</td><td>Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet
      storm, or hot weather</td></tr><tr><td>Summer</td><td>Torrential rain,
      heat wave, or hailstorm</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn</td><td>Hot or cold
      weather, fog, or sleet</td></tr><tr><td>Winter</td><td>Frigid cold,
      blizzard, or thaw</td></tr><tr><td>Late winter or early
      spring</td><td>Hurricane-force winds</td></tr></tbody></table> You control
      the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity
      of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather-where
      lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. The
      weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a
      standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests
      itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible
      simultaneously.<p></p><p><i>Control weather</i> can do away with
      atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create
      them.</p><p>A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a
      circle with a 3-mile radius.</p>
