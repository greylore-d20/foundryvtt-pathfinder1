    value: >-
      <p>The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. <i>Feather fall</i>
      instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per
      round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects
      take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell
      duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.</p><p>The spell
      affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and
      carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the
      equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two
      Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four
      Medium creatures or objects, and so forth.</p><p>This spell has no special
      effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the
      spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based
      on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.</p><p><i>Feather
      fall</i> works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword
      blow or a charging or flying creature.</p>
