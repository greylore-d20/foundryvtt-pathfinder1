This requires expending one daily use of his bombs, but otherwise functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.o4ywdvsm1oty8blq]{Explosive Runes} except that it deals damage as one of the alchemistâ€™s bombs. The alchemist can expend an additional daily use of his bombs to apply one discovery that applies to his bombs, such as acid bomb or dispelling bomb, to the runes created with this discovery.</p>\n<p>An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
