  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per day as an immediate action, the rogue can gain an amount of
      cold resistance or electricity resistance equal to half the rogue's level.
      This resistance lasts for 1 round. If the character has the shadowy
      resistance racial trait, the cold or electricity resistance stacks with
      the resistance that trait grants; otherwise, the energy resistance does
      not stack with any cold or electricity resistance the character has. The
      rogue must have the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.class-abilities.Item.HLd4skGtB4uTjuwU]{resiliency}
      rogue talent before choosing this talent.</p>
