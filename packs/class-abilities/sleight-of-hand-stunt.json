      "value": "<p>In place of an attack of opportunity, a rogue with this talent can attempt a Sleight of Hand check against the CMD of an opponent that provokes an attack of opportunity by firing a projectile weapon while threatened. If successful, the rogue plucks the ammunition from the provoking weapon, negating the attack. The rogue may use this ability as many times in a round as she could make attacks of opportunity. At the GMâ€™s discretion, certain projectile weapons may not be susceptible to this ability, such as siege engines or firearms. A rogue must be trained in Sleight of Hand to select this talent.</p>"
