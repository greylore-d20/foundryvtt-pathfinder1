      <p>You curse two or more creatures to sicken and waste away while in each
      others' company. Each target that fails a Fortitude save becomes cursed
      with a wasting sickness. The disease has no onset period, and those who
      contracted it must attempt a second Fortitude save immediately. A target
      that fails this second saving throw takes 1d6 points of Constitution
      damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. Every day thereafter, each
      target that was within 100 feet of another target during the previous 24
      hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma
      damage (reroll to determine the specific amount of damage each day). A
      successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that day only.  A target
      cannot be healed of damage from this disease (naturally or by magic) while
      the target is within 100 feet of another target. If healed of such damage
      while away from other targets, a target might take damage again the day
      they reconvene. This disease is a curse, and can never be cured by
      successful saving throws. The spell can be ended on a single target only
      with a successful casting of <i>remove curse</i> followed by a successful
      casting of <i>remove disease</i> while the target is within 100 feet of at
      least one other target. When the curse remains on only one target, it ends
      automatically.</p>
