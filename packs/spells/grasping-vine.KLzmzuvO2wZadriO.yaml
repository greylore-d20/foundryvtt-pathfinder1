    value: >-
      <p>You cause a long, thin vine to sprout from your body—typically from the
      center of your chest or from the palm of an outstretched hand. As a
      standard action, you can direct the end of the vine to move to any square
      within 20 feet of you and perform one of the following tasks: deliver a
      touch spell that you cast after the vine has grown, pick up an unattended
      object weighing 20 pounds or less, give a held object to another creature,
      attempt to disable a trap or lock using your
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.pf1e-rules.x175kVqUfLGPt8tC.JournalEntryPage.cSdUATLHBFfw3v4s]{Disable
      Device} modifier with a –2 penalty, or perform any other task that the GM
      deems reasonable. The vine does not threaten squares and cannot make
      attacks of opportunity, nor can it wield weapons.</p>
