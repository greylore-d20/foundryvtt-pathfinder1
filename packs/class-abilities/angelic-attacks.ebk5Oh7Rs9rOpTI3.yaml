    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, your melee attacks are considered good-aligned weapons
      for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Furthermore, when you deal
      damage with a melee attack to an evil outsider, you deal an additional 1d6
      points of damage. This additional damage stacks with effects such as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.zujht80bgjdk9cyb]{Align Weapon} and those granted
      by a weapon with the <a

      weapon special ability.</p>
