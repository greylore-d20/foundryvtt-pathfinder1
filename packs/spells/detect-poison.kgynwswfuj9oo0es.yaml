  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or
      is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20
      Wisdom check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20
      Craft (alchemy) check if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Craft
      (alchemy) check prior to the Wisdom check. The spell can penetrate
      barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of
      lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>
