      <p>You can control the properties of metal, allowing your metal blast to
      bypass damage reduction as if it were adamantine, cold iron, or silver
      (your choice). If your target has an unusual type of damage reduction that
      could be overcome with the correct type of metal (such as DR/gold), you
      can also select that metal for this purpose. The metal you create with
      this infusion crumbles away shortly thereafter and has no gp value.</p>
