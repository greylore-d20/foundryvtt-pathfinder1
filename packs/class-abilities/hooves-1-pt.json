      "value": "<p>An eidolon has a pair of sharp hooves at the end of its limbs, giving it two hoof attacks. These attacks are secondary attacks. The hooves deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). The eidolon must have the limbs evolution to take this evolution. This evolution can only be applied to the limbs (legs) evolution once. Alternatively, the eidolon can replace the claws evolution from its base form with these hoof attacks (this still costs 1 evolution point).</p>\n<p>This evolution can be selected more than once, but the eidolon must possess an equal number of limbs evolutions.</p>"
