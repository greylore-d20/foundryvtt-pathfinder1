  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Prior to making a melee attack roll, you can choose to convert all
      damage from that strike into nonlethal damage, adding your Wisdom modifier
      to the damage. If your attack hits, as a free action you can attempt an
      Intimidate check to demoralize the target. You gain a bonus on this
      Intimidate check equal to the amount of nonlethal damage dealt by the
      painful smite. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to
      3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p>This power replaces the Destructive Smite power of the Destruction
      Domain.</p>
