      <p>A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb.
      This potent device is used to store programming meant to augment or change
      the nature of how an AI functions. Originally used as a portable method of
      safely transporting and storing the complex code required to program
      artificial intelligences, memory facets can also be used to augment an
      existing AI. Full rules for memory facets can be found on pages 62-63 of
      <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #86: Lords of Rust</em>, including rules for
      aggression facets, ego facets, and inhibitor facets. The new memory facets
      detailed below can be found in "Palace of Fallen
      Stars."</p><p><strong>Discipline Facet</strong>: This memory facet
      bolsters an AI's thought and personality with rigid order and behavior,
      granting it a +2 enhancement bonus to its Intelligence score. In addition,
      the facet grants the AI the ability to bolster the programming of any
      robot within 30 feet as a swift action for a number of rounds per day
      equal to its CR. A bolstered robot gains a +2 circumstance bonus on attack
      rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. The AI can target an
      aggregate (<em>Technology Guide</em> 59) under its control with this
      effect.</p>
