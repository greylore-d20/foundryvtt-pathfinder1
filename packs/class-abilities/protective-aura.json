      "value": "<p>At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot protective aura as a standard action. Allies in this aura receive a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, allies in the area gain the benefits of&nbsp;protection from evil&nbsp;(although the AC bonus and saving throw bonus do not stack with those granted by this effect). You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not have to be consecutive.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the Holy Lance power of the Good Domain.</p>"
