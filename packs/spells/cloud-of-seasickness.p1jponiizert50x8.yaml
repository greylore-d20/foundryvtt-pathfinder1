  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>stinking cloud</i>, except as noted above
    and that the vapors make creatures sickened instead of nauseated. <i>Cloud
    of Seasickness</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell
    (requiring a 9th-level caster and costing 2,500 gp). A permanent <i>Cloud of
    Seasickness</i> dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>
