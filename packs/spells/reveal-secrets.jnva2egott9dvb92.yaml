  shortDescription: >-
    <p>When you cast this spell, you ask the target whether it has a secret
    about a specific topic that can be described in 10 words or fewer. This can
    concern a person, place, or thing (such as a town's mayor, the ring worn by
    a traveling merchant, or the bridge spanning a nearby river) or an easily
    distinguished event (such as a historic battle or a recent rash of
    disappearances). If the target knows a secret about the topic (information
    it believes isn't common knowledge and which it would not normally tell
    you), it states it has a secret. The target doesn't mention anything about
    the secret and doesn't remember telling you it has a secret. If the target
    succeeds at its saving throw, it isn't compelled to reveal whether it knows
    a secret and is aware that you asked.</p>
