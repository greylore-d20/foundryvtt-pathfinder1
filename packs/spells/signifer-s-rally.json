Allies are <i>teleport</i>ed as if you had cast <i>teleport</i> on them (your current location is at least \"studied carefully\" for this purpose), appearing in a puff of brimstone in a space adjacent to you. If you are in combat and your allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon arrival but are not considered flat-footed even though they have not taken any actions. The spell does not function in areas warded against intrusion by evil creatures (such as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect).</p>",
