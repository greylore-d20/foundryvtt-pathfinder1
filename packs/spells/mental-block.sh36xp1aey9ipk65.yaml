      drawing upon its experience and expertise. The target loses all skill
      ranks, spells known, spells prepared, and activated feats, as well as its
      extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. Each round at the
      end of the target's turn, the target can attempt another Will save to end
      this effect.</p>
