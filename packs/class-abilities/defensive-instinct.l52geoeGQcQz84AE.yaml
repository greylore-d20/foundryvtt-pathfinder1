  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, unencumbered, and
      conscious, the shifter adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and CMD.
      If she is wearing nonmetal armor or using a nonmetal shield, she instead
      adds half her Wisdom bonus to her AC (minimum 0). In addition, the shifter
      gains a +1 bonus to her AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1
      for every 4 shifter levels thereafter (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th
      level).<p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks and when
      the shifter is flatfooted. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized
      or helpless. These bonuses do not stack with the monk AC bonus class
      feature.</p>
