The resulting mixture is then strained and poured into a shallow pan to evaporate. The resulting crust is scraped off as a powder.</p>\r\n<p><b>Use</b> Anyone wearing or carrying fresh moly gains a +4 <em>resistance bonus</em> on saving throws against spells and <em>spell-like abilities</em>. Moly remains fresh in this way for only 12 hours, regardless of magical attempts to preserve it. When processed into a powder with a successful DC 25 <em>Craft</em> (alchemy) check, moly can be sprinkled on a creature, object, or area (a <em>standard action</em>) to end a spell as if with <em>dispel magic</em> (<em>caster level</em> 6th).</p>\r\n"
