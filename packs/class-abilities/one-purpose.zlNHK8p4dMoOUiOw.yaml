  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, the cavalier’s mount shares the benefits of the
      cavalier’s guarded ability as long as both are wearing light or no armor
      and carrying no more than a light load. The cavalier must fight
      defensively or use @Compendium[pf1.feats.NFxHebU1XhEs5WJh]{Combat
      Expertise} to grant these benefits, but the mount need not. In addition,
      the mount gains all the benefits of the cavalier’s challenge, regardless
      of what barding it wears.</p>
