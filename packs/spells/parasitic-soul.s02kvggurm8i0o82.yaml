  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions like <i>magic jar</i> except as noted above, and
    instead of your own soul, you can transfer a trapped soul (such as one
    trapped in a soul gem or trapped with <i>soul bind</i> or <i>trap the</i>
    soul) from the receptacle into an unwilling target's body. If the target
    creature fails its saving throw, it dies and the trapped soul in the
    receptacle permanently inhabits the body as if using <i>magic jar</i>. The
    trapped soul does not get a saving throw to resist this transfer. To dismiss
    the spell, you must be within range of the possessed body.</p>
