      <p>You seize control of a summoned creature by disrupting the bond between
      it and the caster who summoned it. If the creature fails its save, you may
      command it as if you had summoned it. The original caster can attempt to
      regain control of the creature as a standard action by making an opposed
      Spellcraft check against you. When your spell ends, control reverts to the
      original summoner. If the summoning spell ends before this spell ends, the
      remaining duration of this spell is lost.</p>
