  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The rogue becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that she
      can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.<p>Upon gaining this
      ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence
      modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take
      10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing
      so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting
      additional skills for skill mastery to apply to each time.</p>
