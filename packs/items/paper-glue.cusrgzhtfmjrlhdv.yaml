    value: >-
      <p>This 1-foot-square piece of paper is coated on one side with a weak
      glue or sticky material such as tree sap or even honey. It is stored
      folded in half. If you apply glue paper to a window before you break it,
      the broken pieces stick to the glue rather than noisily falling to the
      ground. Glue paper is good for a single use.</p>
