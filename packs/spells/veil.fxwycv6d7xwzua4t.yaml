      <p>You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain
      that appearance for the spell's duration. You can make the subjects appear
      to be anything you wish. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the
      creatures the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their
      normal appearances if slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to
      duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a
      +10 bonus on the check.</p><p>Unwilling targets can negate the spell's
      effect on them by making Will saves or with spell resistance. Those who
      interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbelief saves to see through
      the glamer, but spell resistance doesn't help.</p>
