      (mithral)</p><h3>Description</h3><p>This 8-inch-diameter skillet has a
      long handle and feet so you can rest it on a fire or hot coals.
      Adventurers prefer models with a hinged handle that folds over the top of
      the skillet for easier storage and transport. A mithral skillet is lighter
      and food rarely sticks to it.</p>
