      <p><i>Purge spirit</i> rips away at the target's spiritual substance,
      scattering it over a wide area and hampering the target's ability to
      reform. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum
      10d6) and is staggered for 1 round. On a successful saving throw, the
      target takes half damage and is not staggered. This spell affects astrally
      projected creatures, ethereal creatures, haunts, incorporeal creatures,
      mediums channeling a spirit, and phantoms, and at the GM's discretion can
      affect other spirits or creatures made of ectoplasm. Incorporeal creatures
      take full damage from <i>purge spirit</i>.</p>
