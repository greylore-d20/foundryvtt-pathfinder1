      <p>As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to summon
      a servitor. This ability functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.kyo0kwhw2jhuztju]{Summon Monster I}, but you can
      use it only to summon a single creature, and the effect lasts for 1
      minute.</p>

      <p>At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the level of the summon
      monster spell increases by 1, to a maximum of
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.et3440o24hcgrfwl]{Summon Monster VII} at 19th
      level. You canâ€™t have more than one servitor in effect at a time.</p>

      <p>At any time, you can expend 1 point of mental focus as a free action to
      extend the duration of an active servitor by 1 minute.</p>
