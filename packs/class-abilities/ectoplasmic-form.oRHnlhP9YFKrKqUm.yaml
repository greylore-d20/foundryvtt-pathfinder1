  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, you can transform into a cloud of ectoplasm. Treat this
      as @Compendium[pf1.spells.mqdoexj35atgqafn]{Gaseous Form}, except that you
      can <em>fly</em> at a speed of 30 feet, and you can solidify your form
      sufficiently to carry small objects, though fine manipulation is
      impossible. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal
      to your <em>sorcerer</em> level.</p>

      <p>These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute
      increments.</p>
