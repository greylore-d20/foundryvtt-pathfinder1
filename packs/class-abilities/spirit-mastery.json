He can use his spirit surge ability an additional two times per day without incurring influence, regardless of whether he accepts a taboo or channels a weaker spirit. When channeling a weaker spirit, he can use his spirit surge ability an additional four times per day for each power he forgoes, instead of an additional two times.</p>"
