Because you still have a smell, creatures with <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent\">scent</a> can still detect and pinpoint if you are cloaked; they just can't identify your smell as something unique. Washing for 1 full round removes the scent cloak.</p>\r\n"
