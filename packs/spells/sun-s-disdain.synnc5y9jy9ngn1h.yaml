  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You alter a creature so the touch of the sun is hostile to it. The cursed
    creature gains <i>light</i> blindness and is blinded for 1 round if exposed
    to bright <i>light</i>, such as sun<i>light</i> or the
    <i>day<i>light</i></i> spell. The cursed creature is dazzled as long as it
    remains in areas of bright <i>light</i>, and it is treated as being
    particularly susceptible to sun<i>light</i> for the purposes of resolving
    spells like searing <i>light</i>, <i>sunbeam</i>, and <i>sunburst</i>.</p>
