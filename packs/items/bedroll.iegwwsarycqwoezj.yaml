      <p>This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom and
      one side to create a bag for sleeping in. Some have cloth straps along the
      open side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are sleeping. It can
      be rolled and tied into a tight coil for storage or transport. Most people
      use a <em>blanket</em> with the bedroll to stay warm or provide a ground
      cushion.</p>
