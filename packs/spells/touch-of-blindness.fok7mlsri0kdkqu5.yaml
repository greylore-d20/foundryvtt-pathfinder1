    value: >-
      <p>A touch from your hand, which is engulfed in darkness, disrupts a
      creature's vision by coating its eyes in supernatural darkness. Each touch
      causes the target to become blinded for 1 round unless it makes a
      successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up
      to one time per caster level. Any touch attack not used after 1 round per
      caster level is lost.</p>
