  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, your soul becomes one with the world of the fey. You
      gain immunity to poison and <em>DR</em> 10/cold iron. Creatures of the
      animal type do not attack you unless compelled to do so through magic.
      Once per day, you can cast @Compendium[pf1.spells.btoow6tyv39443gh]{Shadow
      Walk} as a spell-like ability using your sorcerer level as your caster
      level.</p>
