      <p><i>Stalwart resolve</i> was originally created to temporarily aid those
      suffering from certain afflictions. The recipient of <i>stalwart
      resolve</i> ignores the effects of ability damage and penalties to a
      single ability score of your choice, except that damage equal to or
      greater than the ability score still causes unconsciousness or death. This
      applies whether or not the ability damage or penalty happened before or
      during the spell's duration, and whether or not multiple sources are
      involved. This spell has no effect on ability drain.</p>
