  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a
      successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray
      takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any
      creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely
      disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated
      creature's equipment is unaffected.</p><p>When used against an object, the
      ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter.
      Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or
      structure targeted.</p><p>The ray affects even objects constructed
      entirely of force, such as <i>forceful hand</i> or a <i>Wall of Force</i>,
      but not magical effects such as a <i>Globe of Invulnerability</i> or an
      <i>antimagic field</i>.</p><p>A creature or object that makes a successful
      Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If
      this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is
      entirely disintegrated.</p><p>Only the first creature or object struck can
      be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.</p>
