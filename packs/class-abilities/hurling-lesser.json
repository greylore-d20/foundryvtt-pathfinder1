      "value": "<p>As a full-round action while raging, the barbarian can lift and hurl an object up to one size category smaller than herself with both hands or two size categories smaller with one hand as an improvised weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. This inflicts damage as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Falling%20Objects&amp;Category=Environmental%20Rules\">falling object</a>&nbsp;plus the barbarian’s Strength bonus. This damage is halved if the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. This is a ranged touch attack, and the target may attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Strength modifier) for half damage. The barbarian may apply @Compendium[pf1.feats.FUW5mIXHNBBIQ1Sq]{Power Attack}&nbsp;to this attack as a one- or two-handed weapon, as appropriate.</p>"
