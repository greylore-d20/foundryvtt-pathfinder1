      "value": "<h4>Heatstone</h4>\n<p><b>Price</b> 20 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>\n<p>Heatstones are pieces of volcanic glass formed naturally in deserts that have the ability to keep an area pleasantly warm even in otherwise frigid conditions.</p>\n<p>Though these stones are often traded away to colder regions or used to keep tents comfortable during the desert nights, magicians and scientists both routinely find new ways to put heatstones to use.</p>\n<p>Some heatstones are alchemically treated to produce heat that lasts indefinitely or to be used in permanent items (see <em>Heatstone</em> Items). However, common heatstones found in the wilds can be made to function as described below with only a simple alchemical treatment and can be bought at the listed price.</p>\n<p>Alchemically treated to enhance their natural heat-generating properties, these round or ovoid stones of volcanic glass provide enough heat to keep chambers warm in the coldest winter. One heatstone keeps a 20-foot-square area comfortably warm even in extreme cold (below -20 degree F), or a 40-foot-square area in severe cold (between 0 degree F and -20 degree F).</p>\n<p>A single heatstone is activated by striking it against any hard surface, after which point it continues to provide heat for 24 hours. An active heatstone does not give off enough heat to cook food or cause damage.</p>"
