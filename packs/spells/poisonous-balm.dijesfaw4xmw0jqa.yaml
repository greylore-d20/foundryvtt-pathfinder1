      <p>You mend the target's injuries, curing 3d8 hit points + 1 point per
      caster level (maximum +15) as <i><i>cure serious</i> wounds</i>, but
      leaving its body laced with a subtle toxin that remains inert until you
      activate it. A target that decides to attempt the Will save and succeeds
      is healed for half (as <i><i>cure serious</i> wounds</i>) and negates the
      toxin. Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell
      as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of
      Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the
      target can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round's
      damage and end the affliction. If you don't trigger the poison for 1 hour,
      the spell ends and leaves the target unharmed. <i>Detect poison</i>
      reveals an inert <i><i>poisonous</i> balm</i> only if the caster succeeds
      at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + your caster level.
      Attempts to identify <i><i>poisonous</i> balm</i> with a skill check
      incorrectly identify it as <i><i>cure serious</i> wounds</i> (see the ruse
      descriptor on page 192). A fooled viewer mistakes <i><i>poisonous</i>
      balm</i>'s aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous effect.</p>
