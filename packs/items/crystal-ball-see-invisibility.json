So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely nonmagical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell&nbsp;@Compendium[pf1.spells.g66w32kdup1f43bp]{Scrying}<em> </em>(Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use. Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.</span></p>\n<p>While looking through the crystal ball, you see things as if affected by @Compendium[pf1.spells.nokru6mxk9p3r513]{See Invisibility}.</p>"
