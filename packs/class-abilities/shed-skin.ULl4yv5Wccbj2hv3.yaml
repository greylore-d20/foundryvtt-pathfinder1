      <p>At 16th level, when your bloodrage ends, you can choose one spell or
      spell-like ability affecting you and attempt to shake it off as an
      immediate action. Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your bloodrager level) as
      if you were casting @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel
      Magic}. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled.</p>
