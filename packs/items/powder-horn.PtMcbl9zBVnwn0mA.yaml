    value: >-
      <p>Typically crafted from hollowed-out animal horn, but increasingly
      crafted from metal in a wide variety of shapes, a powder horn can hold up
      to 10 doses of black powder. A powder horn protects black powder stored
      within in it from exposure to fire, electricity, firearm misfires, and
      water, and the narrow end of the horn is useful in funneling the expensive
      powder carefully into the barrel of a firearm.</p>
