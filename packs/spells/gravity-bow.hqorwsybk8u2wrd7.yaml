  description:
    value: >-
      <p><i>Gravity bow</i> significantly increases the weight and density of
      arrows or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant before they
      strike their target and then return them to normal a few moments later.
      Any arrow fired from a bow or crossbow you are carrying when the spell is
      cast deals damage as if one size larger than it actually is. For instance,
      an arrow fired from a Medium longbow normally deals 1d8 points of damage,
      but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if fired from a <i>gravity
      bow</i> (see page 145 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> for more information).
      Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses your bow to make
      an attack the arrows deal damage as normal for their size.</p>
