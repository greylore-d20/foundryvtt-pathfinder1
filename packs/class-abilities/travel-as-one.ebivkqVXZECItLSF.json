In addition, you and any creatures you teleport gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level that disappear after you reach your destination; these offset any damage you might take from teleportation mishaps or attempting to teleport into a solid body.</p>\n<p>This power replaces the base speed increase of the Travel Domain.</p>"
