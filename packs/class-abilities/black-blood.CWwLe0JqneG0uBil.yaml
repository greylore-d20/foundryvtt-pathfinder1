  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, your blood runs black with the blood of Orv. You are
      immune to the effects (both beneficial and destructive) of black blood.
      You have this benefit constantly, even while not bloodraging. When you
      take damage from a slashing or piercing attack while bloodraging, as an
      immediate action you can grant your melee attacks the <em>frost</em>
      weapon special ability for 2 rounds. You can use this ability three times
      per day.</p>
