      <p>You render the target unable to understand any language, including
      spoken language, written language, sign language, gestures attempting to
      mimic a crude language, or even truespeech and telepathy. The affected
      creature is unable to communicate, use command words, cast spells with
      verbal components, or use any other abilities that requires language.  At
      the end of each of its turns, the subject can attempt a new saving throw
      to end the effect. <i>Tongues</i> counters and dispels <i>aphasia</i>, and
      a creature with the <i>tongues</i> spell active is immune to
      <i>aphasia</i>. Oracles with the <i>tongues</i> curse ignore
      <i>aphasia</i> in combat.</p>
