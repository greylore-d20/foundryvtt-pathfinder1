    value: >-
      <p>Through careful regulation of your body's mystical energies, thoughtful
      control of your poise and balance, and the focus in your mind on the
      surety of each and every step you take, you are able to make your steps
      lighter than air. This grants you the benefits of <i>air walk</i>, except
      as noted above. Additionally, at any time during the spell's duration, you
      can expend the spell's remaining duration as a swift action in order to
      gain a fly speed of 120 feet with perfect maneuverability for 1 minute.
      After this time, the spell ends.</p>
