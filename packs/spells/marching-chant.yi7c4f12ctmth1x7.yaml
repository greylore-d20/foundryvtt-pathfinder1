      <p>You invigorate your allies, who can hustle (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 170)
      as long as you continue to sing or chant (which requires your
      concentration). This movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the
      purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. You can concentrate on
      this spell and hustle at the same time.</p>
