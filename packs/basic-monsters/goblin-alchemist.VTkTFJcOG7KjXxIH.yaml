          <p>Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully
          experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is
          often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous
          as the concoctions he brews. While some creators of <em>alchemical
          items</em> content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants,
          providing <em>tindertwigs</em> and <em>smokesticks</em>, the true
          alchemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than cast magic like a
          spellcaster, the alchemist captures his own magic potential within
          liquids and extracts he creates, infusing his chemicals with virulent
          power to grant him impressive skill with poisons, explosives, and all
          manner of self-transformative magic.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: The
          alchemist’s reputation is not softened by his exuberance (some would
          say dangerous recklessness) in perfecting his magical extracts and
          potion-like creations, infusing these substances with magic siphoned
          from his aura and using his own body as experimental stock. Nor is it
          mollified by the alchemist’s almost gleeful passion for building
          explosive bombs and discovering strange new poisons and methods for
          their use. These traits, while making him a liability and risk for
          most civilized organizations and institutions of higher learning, seem
          to fit quite well with most adventuring groups.</p><h2>Class
          Skills</h2><p>The alchemist’s class skills are Appraise (Int), Craft
          (any) (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Knowledge

          <p>Alchemists are not only masters of creating mundane alchemical
          substances such as alchemist’s fire and smokesticks, but also of
          fashioning magical potion-like extracts in which they can store spell
          effects. In effect, an alchemist prepares his spells by mixing
          ingredients into a number of extracts, and then “casts” his spells by
          drinking the extract. When an alchemist creates an extract or bomb, he
          infuses the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical
          power—this enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds
          the effects to the creator.</p><p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create
          an alchemical item, an alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his
          class level on the Craft (alchemy) check. In addition, an alchemist
          can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic.
          He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.</p><p>An
          alchemist can create three special types of magical items—extracts,
          bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash weapons, and mutagens
          are transformative elixirs that the alchemist drinks to enhance his
          physical abilities—both of these are detailed in their own sections
          below.</p><p>Extracts are the most varied of the three. In many ways,
          they behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can
          be dispelled by effects like
          @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic} using the
          alchemist’s level as the caster level. Unlike potions, though,
          extracts can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a potion
          normally could not.</p><p>An alchemist can create only a certain
          number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of
          extracts is given on Table 2–1. In addition, he receives bonus
          extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way
          a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p><p>When an alchemist mixes
          an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with
          magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately
          becomes inert if it leaves the alchemist’s possession, reactivating as
          soon as it returns to his keeping—an alchemist cannot normally pass
          out his extracts for allies to use (but see the “infusion” discovery
          below). An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before
          losing its magic, so an alchemist must re-prepare his extracts every
          day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work—most alchemists prepare
          many extracts at the start of the day or just before going on an
          adventure, but it’s not uncommon for an alchemist to keep some (or
          even all) of his daily extract slots open so that he can prepare
          extracts in the field as needed.</p><p>Although the alchemist doesn’t
          actually cast spells, he does have a <em>formulae list</em> that
          determines what extracts he can create. An alchemist can utilize
          spell-trigger items if the spell appears on his formuale list, but not
          spell-completion items (unless he uses Use Magic Device to do so). An
          extract is “cast” by drinking it, as if imbibing a potion—the effects
          of an extract exactly duplicate the spell upon which its formula is
          based, save that the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist.
          An alchemist can draw and drink an extract as a standard action. The
          alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any effect
          based on caster level.</p><p>Creating extracts consumes raw materials,
          but the cost of these materials is insignificant—comparable to the
          valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has
          a costly material component, that component is expended during the
          consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from
          spells that have focus requirements (alchemist extracts that duplicate
          divine spells never have a divine focus requirement).</p><p>An
          alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or
          use an extract, an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to
          at least 10 + the extract’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving
          throw against an alchemist’s extract is 10 + the extract level + the
          alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.</p><p>An alchemist may know any
          number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a
          formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an
          extract but not when he consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two
          1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae
          equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level, he
          gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist
          can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to
          his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. An
          alchemist can study a wizard’s spellbook to learn any formula that is
          equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however,
          cannot learn spells from a formula book. An alchemist does not need to
          decipher arcane writings before copying them.</p>

          <p>In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly
          mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical
          reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies.
          An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class
          level + his <em>Intelligence</em> modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if
          not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become
          inert—their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive
          material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the
          alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid
          catalyst—the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small
          amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be
          readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster’s component
          pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start
          of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that
          day—once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for
          years.</p>

          <p>Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a
          <em>standard action</em> that provokes an attack of opportunity.
          Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the <em>Throw Splash
          Weapon</em> special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be
          selected using feats such as
          @Compendium[pf1.feats.8rsFtye3PwM6CKli]{Point-Blank Shot} and
          @Compendium[pf1.feats.n250dFlbykAIAg5Z]{Weapon Focus}. On a direct
          hit, an alchemist’s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage +
          additional damage equal to the alchemist’s <em>Intelligence</em>
          modifier. The damage of an alchemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points at
          every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not
          multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as
          @Compendium[pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital Strike}). Splash damage
          from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb’s minimum damage
          (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct
          hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught
          in the splash damage can attempt a <em>Reflex</em> save for half
          damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level
          + the alchemist’s <em>Intelligence</em> modifier.</p>

          <p>Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the
          <em>Discovery</em> ability) as they level up. An alchemist’s bomb,
          like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p>

          <p>At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that
          he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of
          his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once
          brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain
          one dose of mutagen at a time—if he brews a second dose, any existing
          mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is
          not in an alchemist’s possession becomes inert until an alchemist
          picks it up again.</p><p>When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects
          one physical ability score—either Strength, Dexterity, or
          Constitution. It’s a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being
          imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more
          bestial, granting him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical
          bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist
          level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist
          takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen
          enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence. If it
          enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to his Wisdom. If it
          enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his
          Charisma.</p><p>A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a
          Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s
          Intelligence modifier) or become nauseated for 1 hour—a non-alchemist
          can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the
          effects of another alchemist’s mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if
          the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the
          “stolen” mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not
          stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any
          previous mutagen immediately end.</p>

          <p>A dagger is a fighting knife. Its blade is usually less than 1 foot
          long, and can be curved or straight, with one edge or two. Dagger
          designs vary widely, and can have many different names (such as a
          thrusting dagger being called a "dirk"). You get a +2 bonus on Sleight
          of Hand skill checks made to conceal a dagger on your body.</p>

          <p>This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling
          its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the
          creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2
          size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum
          of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased
          size.</p><p>A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a
          space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not
          change the target's speed.</p><p>If insufficient room is available for
          the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and
          may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any
          enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm
          by the materials enclosing it-the spell cannot be used to crush a
          creature by increasing its size.</p><p>All equipment worn or carried
          by a creature is similarly <i>enlarged</i> by the spell. Melee weapons
          affected by this spell deal more damage (see page 145). Other magical
          properties are not affected by this spell. Any <i>enlarged</i> item
          that leaves an <i>enlarged</i> creature's possession (including a
          projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size.
          This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal
          damage. Magical properties of <i>enlarged</i> items are not increased
          by this spell.</p><p>Multiple magical effects that increase size do
          not stack.</p><p><i>Enlarge person</i> counters and dispels <i>reduce
          person</i>.</p><p><i>Enlarge person</i> can be made permanent with a
          <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
