      (Sp)}: As a standard action, you can touch an undead creature and infuse
      it with negative energy. It gains a +1 profane bonus on all attack rolls
      and saving throws, as well as 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die and a +2
      bonus to its turn resistance. The bonus on attack rolls and saving throws
      increases by +1 for every 5 wizard levels you possess. These bonuses last
      for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1 round).
      The bonuses and temporary hit points are immediately dispelled if the
      creature is within the area of a consecrate spell. You can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence
      modifier.</p>
