      "value": "<p>An incendiary charge is a bomb specifically designed to overcome the effects of any nonmagical objectâ€™s hardness. As a full-round action, the alchemist can place an incendiary charge that burns and eats away at an object, dealing normal bomb damage to it. (The damage is not halved against an object with hardness, unlike most energy damage.) Furthermore, the incendiary charge ignores the first 5 points of hardness of the material being damaged.<br><br>The alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.</p>"
