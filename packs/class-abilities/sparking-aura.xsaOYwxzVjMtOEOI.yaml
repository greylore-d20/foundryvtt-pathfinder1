  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with
      electrical energy. Though this does not harm the creature, it does cause
      the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any
      benef it from concealment or invisibility.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a
      metal melee weapon, it also takes an amount of electricity damage equal to
      the shamanâ€™s Charisma modifier. The sparking aura lasts a 1 round for ever
      2 shaman levels the shaman possesses.</p>

      <p>A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24
      hours.</p>
