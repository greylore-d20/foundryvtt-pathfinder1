    value: >-
      <p>Creatures within the area cannot send or receive telepathic messages,
      and anyone in the area casting a spell with a thought component must
      succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell’s level; this
      includes the increased concentration DC for casting spells with a thought
      component) or lose the spell. Furthermore, the thoughts of creatures
      within the area cannot be detected, located, or read with thoughtsense,
      detect thoughts, or similar effects. <em>Telepathic silence</em> does not
      hinder spells that target a creature’s mind or that do not rely on
      communication, such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.rvf2gxyy1d4strae]{mind
      thrust}.</p>
