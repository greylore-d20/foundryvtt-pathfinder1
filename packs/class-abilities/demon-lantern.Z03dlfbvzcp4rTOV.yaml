    value: >-
      <p>Once per day when she casts dancing lights, the rogue can conjure a
      single demon’s lantern instead of the usual four lights. A demon lantern
      acts in all ways as a hypnotic pattern spell cast by a wizard, except it
      also casts light as a torch and it fascinates only a single target whose
      Hit Dice do not exceed the rogue’s class level. The save DC of this effect
      is equal to 11 + the rogue’s Intelligence modifier. The rogue must have an
      Intelligence score of at least 11 to select this talent. A rogue must have
      selected the minor magic rogue talent and selected dancing lights as her
      spell of choice or otherwise be able to cast dancing lights before
      choosing this talent.</p>
