      <p>This alchemical concoction can be spread over a Medium or Small
      creature's body as a <em>full-round action</em>. It provides a +5
      <em>alchemical bonus</em> on <em>Escape Artist</em> checks, CMD checks to
      avoid a <em>grapple</em>, and <em>Reflex</em> saves to avoid an ooze's
      improved grab or engulf abilities, but gives a -5 penalty to
      <em>disarm</em> checks, <em>grapple</em> checks to start or maintain a
      <em>grapple</em> or <em>pin</em>, and other checks that may be hindered by
      a loose grip (such as <em>Climb</em>). One application lasts for up to 1
      hour and can be removed with soap and water.</p>
