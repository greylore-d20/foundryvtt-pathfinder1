      "value": "<p>You can effortlessly give aid to your allies, whether that means providing them with help attacking or defending them in the heat of combat. You gain Bodyguard&nbsp;as a bonus feat, and whenever you use the aid another action to provide a bonus on attack rolls or to AC to one of your allies, the bonus you provide increases by 1. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 5 oracle levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). It doesn’t stack with other feats or class features that improve the bonus you provide when using the aid another action.</p>\n<p>This revelation also counts as the Combat Expertise feat, but only for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Swift Aid&nbsp;feat and any feat that lists Swift Aid as a prerequisite.</p>"
