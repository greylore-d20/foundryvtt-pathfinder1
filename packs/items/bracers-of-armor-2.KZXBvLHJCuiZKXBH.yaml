      <p>These items appear to be wrist or arm guards, sometimes etched with
      symbols of protection or depictions of vigilant-looking animals. Bracers
      of armor surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of
      force, granting him an armor bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were
      wearing armor. Both bracers of armor must be worn for the magic to be
      effective. Alternatively, bracers of armor can be enchanted with armor
      special abilities. See Table 3-3: Armor Special Abilities for a list of
      abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for
      determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. Bracers of
      armor cannot have a modified bonus (armor bonus plus armor special ability
      bonus equivalents) higher than +8. Bracers of armor must have at least a
      +1 armor bonus to grant an armor special ability. Bracers of armor cannot
      have any armor special abilities that add a flat gp amount to their cost.
      Bracers of armor and ordinary armor do not stack. If the wearer receives a
      larger armor bonus from another source, the bracers of armor cease
      functioning and do not grant their armor bonus or their armor special
      abilities. If the bracers of armor grant a larger armor bonus, the other
      source of armor ceases
      functioning.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Requirements</strong>
