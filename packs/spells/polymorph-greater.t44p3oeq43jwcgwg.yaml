      <p>This spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.d40ia71c2eljm91k]{Polymorph} except that it allows
      the creature to take on the form of a dragon or plant creature. If you use
      this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical
      beast, it functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.br37848gchetel0q]{Beast
      Shape IV}. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.hd32fuc6e7j4isbn]{Elemental Body III}<em>.</em> If
      the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.kouqz0pm1xl8xilm]{Alter Self}. If the form is that
      of a plant, the spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.ik4riccm7tozdwox]{Plant Shape II}<em>.</em> If the
      form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.iqcjiyi9leldfzxt]{Form of the Dragon I}<em>.</em>
      The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action;
      doing so ends the spell.</p>
