Meanwhile, those spirits clinging to your life essence become increasingly protective, channeling their abilities to aid you and warn of threats. Psychics of this discipline are most common in Ustalav and Shenmen, where so many spirits are stuck in the transition between life and death.<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability:</strong> Charisma<p><strong>Bonus Spells: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.aa0w7tk852iqn3ni]{Detect Undead} (1st), </li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.y4ztvvswf2uuwuqo]{Calm Spirit} (4th), </li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.f98kluovmjf6w7d5]{Halt Undead} (6th), </li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.ykb7nby9eovw8jyo]{Speak With Haunt} (8th), </li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.wr96kbh0sqxecx63]{Disrupting Weapon} (10th), </li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.lllhr9py6w44cxjm]{Undeath to Death} (12th), </li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.btccs4sjo2nog1a0]{Ethereal Jaunt} (14th), </li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.0j2cb0iv0695a45i]{Possession, Greater} (16th), </li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.gw9bes9othfqm7mi]{Etherealness} (18th).</li>\n</ul>"
