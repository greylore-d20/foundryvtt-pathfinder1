    value: >-
      <p>When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that
      deals sneak attack damage, any nonmagical light sources worn or carried by
      the creature (such as lit torches, lanterns, or sunrods) are automatically
      extinguished. Once per day, the rogue can use this ability to also attempt
      a dispel check (as per dispel magic) against any magical sources of light
      a target carries, using her rogue level as the caster level.</p>
