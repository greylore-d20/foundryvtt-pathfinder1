  shortDescription: >-
    <p>This spell functions only against a creature with an attitude toward you
    of indifferent or better, and only if the target is not hostile toward you
    or your visible allies. A target touched by you (this touch usually requires
    a successful melee touch attack) must succeed at a Will saving throw or fall
    asleep for 2d6 hours. While asleep, the creature is helpless. For 1 minute
    after the creature is affected, any loud noise or rough contact causes it to
    awaken immediately. Thereafter, slapping or wounding an affected creature
    awakens it, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard
    action (this is an application of the aid another action).</p>
