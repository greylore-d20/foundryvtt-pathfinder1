  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The arcanist can learn to cast a spell by suffering from its effects.
      When the arcanist fails a saving throw against a spell cast by an enemy,
      as an immediate action she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to
      temporarily acquire the spell. She can cast the spell using her spell
      slots as if it was a spell she had prepared that day. The spell must be on
      the sorcerer/wizard spell list and must be of a level that she can
      cast.</p>

      <p>The ability to cast this spell remains for a number of rounds equal to
      the arcanistâ€™s Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>
