  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You surround the touched creatures with a constant and moveable 1-inch
    shell of tolerable living conditions. This shell enables the subjects to
    breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making them
    immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and poisons
    and spells like <i>cloudkill</i> and <i>stinking cloud</i>. In addition, the
    shell protects subjects from extremes of temperature (per <i>endure
    elements</i>) as well as extremes of pressure.</p><p><i>Life bubble</i> does
    not provide protection from negative or positive energy (such as found on
    the Negative and Positive Energy planes), the ability to see in conditions
    of poor visibility (such as in smoke or fog), nor the ability to move or act
    normally in conditions that impede movement (such as underwater).</p><p>When
    you cast this spell it has a total duration of 2 hours per caster level. You
    can divide this duration up in any manner you wish, not necessarily equally,
    between up to 1 creature per caster level.</p>
