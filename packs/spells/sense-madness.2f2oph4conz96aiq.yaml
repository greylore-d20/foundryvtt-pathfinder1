      <p>You can sense the presence of mental disturbance in creatures within
      range, focusing your detection on one creature each round. If the target
      is currently suffering from any form of madness (see page 182) or
      addiction (<i>GameMastery Guide</i> 236), has total sanity damage greater
      than or equal to its sanity edge (see page 12), or is under a magical
      compulsion that could be detected by <i>detect magic</i>, you can detect
      the presence of such a disturbance on the first round of concentration. 
      If you concentrate on the same creature for an additional round, you learn
      if the creature's total sanity damage is greater than or equal to its
      sanity edge, and you can attempt a Sense Motive check against a DC equal
      to 10 + the save DC of the target's madness or addiction to determine the
      exact nature of a madness or addiction. Additionally, you can attempt a
      Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the
      compulsion against each magical compulsion currently affecting the target
      that could be detected by <i>detect magic</i>. If successful, you can
      identify the specific spell affecting the target. You gain a +4 bonus on
      your Spellcraft check if the effect is <i>confusion</i>, <i>insanity</i>,
      or a similar effect that explicitly causes madness or <i>insanity</i>. If
      you successfully identify such an effect with <i>sense madness</i>, the
      insights provided  by this spell grant you a +1 circumstance bonus on your
      next caster level check in the following 1 minute made to counter, dispel,
      or remove that specific effect. After attempting a check to identify a
      madness, addiction, or compulsion, you can't attempt that check against
      the same creature again, even if you concentrate on the creature
      again.</p>
