      "value": "<p>At 10th level, once per day as an immediate action upon falling unconscious because of dropping below 0 hit points, you can cast your soul from your body and attempt to occupy the body of another creature within 30 feet. This ability otherwise functions identically to @Compendium[pf1.spells.8ai7fslz4zu8xe9s]{Magic Jar} except that your actual body serves as the receptacle and you suppress the consciousness of your target rather than casting it out. Your body continues to bleed as normal unless it is somehow stabilized, and if its hit points drop to a negative number equal to your Constitution score, the magic jar effect prematurely ends and you die as normal.</p>"
