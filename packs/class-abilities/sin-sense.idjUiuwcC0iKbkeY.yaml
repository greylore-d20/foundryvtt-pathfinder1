  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a full-round action, you can determine which sin most strongly
      influences a target by quickly reading its mind. Once you learn this fact,
      you gain a +4 bonus on your next Charisma-based skill check made against
      the target as long as it somehow incorporates a temptation that relates to
      that sin. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your Wisdom modifier. This is a mindaffecting effect.</p>
