  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At will, a paladin can use
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.tr7m97npkbgm4wp7]{Detect Evil}, as the spell. A
      paladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual
      within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, learning the strength of its
      aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one
      individual or object, the paladin does not detect evil in any other object
      or individual within range.</p>
