      pleasures, delights, and terrors to be found in the dream world. While in
      this strange dream state, the target moves at half its normal speed (round
      down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping
      distance as normal for decreased speed.</p><p>Multiple <i>Haze of
