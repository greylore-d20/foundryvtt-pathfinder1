    value: >-
      <p>You prevent the targets from having conscious awareness of your
      presence. You make yourself completely un<i>detect</i>able to the subjects
      by erasing all awareness of your presence from their minds. The targets
      can't see, hear, smell, feel, or taste you, including with extraordinary
      or supernatural senses such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, or
      tremorsense. They can't pinpoint your location by any means, including
      <i>detect</i> spells.  The targets remain unaware of your actions,
      provided you don't make any attacks or cause any obvious or directly
      threatening changes in the targets' environment. If you attack any of the
      target creatures, the effect ends. If you take an action that creates a
      sustained and obvious change in the target's environment-for example,
      attacking a creature other than a target or moving a sizeable or attended
      object the target can see-the target immediately receives a new saving
      throw.</p>
