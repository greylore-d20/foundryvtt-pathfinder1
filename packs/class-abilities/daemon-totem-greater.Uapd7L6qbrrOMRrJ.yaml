  description:
    value: >-
      <p>If the barbarian kills an intelligent creature with a CR equal to at
      least half her character level while raging, she heals 5 hit points. If
      she is already at her maximum number of hit points, she instead gains 5
      temporary hit points, which donâ€™t stack if she kills multiple
      creatures.</p>

      <p>A barbarian must be at least 10th level and have the lesser daemon
      totem and daemon totem rage powers to select this rage power.</p>
