    value: >-
      <p><em>Your devastating strikes cleave through weapons and armor and into
      their wielders, damaging both item and wielder alike in a single terrific
      strike.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.lpXdFoT6OqS5vi2X]{Improved Sunder},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.FUW5mIXHNBBIQ1Sq]{Power Attack}, base
      attack bonus +6, Str 13.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You receive a +2
      bonus on checks made to sunder an item. This bonus stacks with the bonus
      granted by Improved Sunder. Whenever you sunder to destroy a weapon,
      shield, or suit of armor, any excess damage is applied to the item's
      wielder. No damage is transferred if you decide to leave the item with 1
      hit point.</p>
