The targeted area must also contain trees or undergrowth, which relay the message in a gentle, rustling voice.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the shaman can also listen to the targeted area as though she were using&nbsp;clairaudience/ clairvoyance&nbsp;for the 1 round during which the hex is delivering the message.</p>"
