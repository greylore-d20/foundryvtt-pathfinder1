  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Calling upon the divine power of your patron, you imbue yourself with
    strength and skill in combat. You gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls,
    weapon damage rolls, Strength checks, and Strength-based skill checks for
    every three caster levels you have (maximum +6). You also gain 1 temporary
    hit point per caster level. Whenever you make a full-attack action, you can
    make an additional attack at your full base attack bonus, plus any
    appropriate modifiers. This additional attack is not cumulative with similar
    effects, such as <i>haste</i> or weapons with the speed special ability.</p>
