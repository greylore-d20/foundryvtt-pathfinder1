  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You place an invisible ward upon the target. The next time a creature
    succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver against the target, the attacker's
    weapon takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). If the
    attacker used a natural weapon for the sunder, the attacker takes half this
    damage. Spell resistance applies to this damage. The attacker can attempt a
    Fortitude save to halve this damage.</p><p>The ward on the target counts as
    a magical trap and can be detected and disabled as such.</p>
