      <p>You sense the presence of a specific kind of evil-that of demons, their
      servants, and the Abyss. The amount of information revealed depends on how
      long you study a particular area or subject. <br /><i>1st Round</i>:
      Presence or absence of creatures with the demon subtype, creatures
      possessed by demons, creatures under the effects of spells or spell-like
      abilities cast by demons, or creatures otherwise tainted by demons.
      Creatures tainted by demons include tieflings with demonic heritages,
      sorcerers with abyssal bloodlines, creatures affected by a succubus's
      profane gift, creatures with demonic implants (see page 44 of
      <i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>Lords of Chaos</i>, <i>Book of
      the</i> <i>Damned</i>, <i>Vol</i>. 2), or creatures who have the Demonic
      Obedience feat (<i>Lords of Chaos</i> 8), and those under significant
      demonic influence as determined by the GM. This spell does not detect
      creatures of chaotic evil alignment who are not demons or significantly
      influenced by demons.  Additionally, this spell detects whether or not a
      portal or similar magical passage leads to the Abyss. <br /><i>2nd
      Round</i>: Number of evil auras shed by creatures with the demon subtype
      in the area, as well as the power of the most potent evil aura present. If
      you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's strength is
      overwhelming; if the creature has HD equal to at least twice your
      character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. <br
      /><i>3rd Round</i>: The power and location of each aura, and what demon
      lord, if any, a demon is most closely affiliated with. If an aura is
      outside your line of sight, you discern the direction but not its exact
      location. Affiliation to a demon lord is only revealed when the creature
      detected is a demon (not merely a creature tainted by a demon). Demons
      receive a Will saving throw to resist revealing what demon lord they are
      affiliated with. If the demon succeeds at this saving throw or is not
      forsworn to a demon lord, you know only that this aspect of the spell
      returned no information.  Aside from what is detailed above, this spell
      otherwise functions similarly to <i>detect evil</i> in terms of aura
      power, lingering auras, overwhelming auras, and so forth.</p>
