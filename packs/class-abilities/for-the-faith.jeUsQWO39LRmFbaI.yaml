    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the cavalier can call upon his faith to bolster himself
      in combat. As a free action, the cavalier can call out the name of his
      deity, granting him a morale bonus on attack rolls equal to his Charisma
      modifier for 1 round. In addition, any allies within 30 feet that share
      his faith also receive half this bonus (minimum +1). The cavalier can use
      this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level
      and every four levels thereafter.</p>
