    value: >-
      <p>The witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave
      misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an ability check,
      attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the
      worse result. A Will save negates this hex.</p>

      <p>At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1
      round. This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target
      of this hex again for 1 day.</p>
