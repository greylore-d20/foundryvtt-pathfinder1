  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you can touch a weapon to bless it with the force of a
      mighty earthquake for 1 minute. When the weapon hits a creature, the
      target must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone; either way, the
      creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>
