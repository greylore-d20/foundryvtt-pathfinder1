  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the character strikes a foe from hiding, she can attempt a Bluff
      check as an immediate action (opposed by the target’s Sense Motive or
      Perception check, whichever has a higher bonus) before rolling damage to
      convince the foe that another creature was the attacker. This Bluff check
      applies the normal modifiers for convincing a creature of a falsehood, but
      can be accomplished with just physical trickery (a shared language is not
      required). If the Bluff is successful, and the character maintains concealment
      or cover, the character’s stealth does not end.</p>
