      <p>You meld a creature into stone, where it can listen to conversations
      without being detected. This functions as the
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.dkv9v4verb82fmpx]{Meld into Stone} spell, except it
      can work on any willing creature, not just you, and it lasts for 10
      minutes per kineticist level or until you use earthmeld again. The melded
      creature, not you, decides when to step out of the stone.</p>

      <p>You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration of an earthmeld
      until the next time you recover burn. Such increased earthmelds donâ€™t end
      if you use earthmeld again, allowing you to maintain multiple
      earthmelds.</p>
