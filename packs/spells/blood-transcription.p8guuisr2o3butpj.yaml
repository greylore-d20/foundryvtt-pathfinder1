  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By consuming 1 pint of blood from a spellcaster killed within the last
      24 hours, you can attempt to learn a spell that spellcaster knew. Select
      one spell available to the dead  spellcaster (this must be a spell on your
      spell list); you gain the knowledge of this spell for 24 hours. During
      this time, you may write it down (or teach it to your familiar, if you are
      a witch) using the normal rules for copying a spell from another source.
      Once you have learned it, you may prepare the spell normally.</p>
