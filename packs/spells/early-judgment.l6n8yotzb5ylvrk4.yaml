  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You show one creature the effect of its life so far and what it might
      expect when it passes under Pharasma's impartial gaze at the end of its
      life. Depending on the creature's alignment and its adherence to its
      ethos, you can provide it a brief glimpse of the reward or punishment that
      waits for it when it dies by showing it a mental image of its destined
      plane in the Great Beyond. If the target is good-aligned, it is fascinated
      for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is neutral-aligned, it is
      confused for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is evil-aligned,
      it is shaken for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.</p>
