    value: >-
      <p>You grant one plant creature the ability to speak, hear, and understand
      any of the languages you know. If you know more than one language, you may
      grant the plant creature up to one language per 2 caster levels and you
      decide which languages to grant when the spell is cast. This spell does
      not cause the plant creature to be predisposed toward you in any way, but
      allows you to interact with them with Charisma-based skills normally.
      Plant creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can communicate
      and understand only the simplest of concepts, such as "friend," "food,"
      and "danger." This spell has no effect on ordinary plants and fungus.</p>
