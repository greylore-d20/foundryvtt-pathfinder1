  description:
    value: >-
      <p>This spell imbues an area with negative energy. The DC to resist
      negative channeled energy within this area gains a +3 profane bonus. Every
      undead creature entering a <i><i>desecrate</i>d</i> area gains a +1
      profane bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving
      throws.</p><p>An undead creature created within or summoned into such an
      area gains +1 hit points per HD. If the <i><i>desecrate</i>d</i> area
      contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your
      deity or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6
      profane bonus to negative channeled energy DCs, +2 profane bonus and +2
      hit points per HD for undead created in the area).</p><p>Furthermore,
      anyone who casts <i>animate dead</i> within this area may create as many
      as double the normal amount of undead (that is, 4 HD per caster level
      rather than 2 HD per caster level).</p><p>If the area contains an altar,
      shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power
      other than your patron, the <i>desecrate</i> spell instead curses the
      area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This
      secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties
      relating to undead, as given above.</p><p><i>Desecrate</i> counters and
