  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Creatures within the area cannot send or receive telepathic messages, and
    anyone in the area casting a spell with a thought component must succeed at
    a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell’s level; this includes the
    increased concentration DC for casting spells with a thought component) or
    lose the spell. Furthermore, the thoughts of creatures within the area
    cannot be detected, located, or read with thoughtsense, detect thoughts, or
    similar effects. <em>Telepathic silence</em> does not hinder spells that
    target a creature’s mind or that do not rely on communication, such as
    @Compendium[pf1.spells.rvf2gxyy1d4strae]{mind thrust}.</p>
