These attacks are primary attacks. The eidolon can make these additional attacks each time it succeeds at a grapple check against the target. These rake attacks deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge).</p>\n<p>This evolution counts as one natural attack toward the eidolon’s maximum.&nbsp;</p>"
