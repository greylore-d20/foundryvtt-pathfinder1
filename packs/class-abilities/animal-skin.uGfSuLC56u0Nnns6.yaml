  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The witch can become any animal of a size from Tiny to Large whose skin
      she wears. This ability is similar to
      @Compendium[pf1.spells.774kmgcb7ygviht0]{Beast Shape II}, except she takes
      on the appearance of the specific individual from which the skin came.</p>
