  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An omdura can call forth he power of her deity to improve her allies’
      abilities as a <em>standard action</em>.</p>

      <p>When the omdura calls upon this power, she must select one type of
      invocation from those listed below to grant the benefits to her allies
      within 30 feet. If the omdura is evil, she grants <em>profane</em> bonuses
      instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral omduras must select
      <em>profane</em> or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be
      changed. A called invocation cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately
      if the omdura is killed, <em>paralyzed</em>, <em>stunned</em>, or knocked
      <em>unconscious</em>.</p>

      <p>The omdura can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal
      to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must
      be spent in 1-minute increments. The omdura can change her chosen
      invocation to another type as a <em>swift action</em>, but doing so
      expends a 1-minute increment of her invocations.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, an omdura can call an invocation as a <em>move
      action</em> instead of a <em>standard action</em>. At 13th level, an
      omdura can call an invocation as a <em>swift action</em>.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><b>Destruction:</b> The omdura’s allies are filled with divine wrath,
      gaining a +1 <em>sacred bonus</em> on weapon damage rolls. This bonus
      increases by 1 for every 3 class levels the omdura has.</li>

      <li><b>Healing:</b> The omdura radiates a healing light, granting <em>fast
      healing</em> 1. This causes the omdura’s allies to recover 1 hit point
      each round (up to their maximum <em>hit points</em>). The amount of
      <em>fast healing</em> increases by 1 for every 3 class levels the omdura
      has.</li>

      <li><b>Justice:</b> This invocation spurs the omdura’s allies to seek
      justice, granting a +1 <em>sacred bonus</em> on <em>attack rolls</em>.
      This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 class levels the omdura has. At 10th
      level, this bonus is doubled on <em>attack rolls</em> to confirm critical
      hits.</li>

      <li><b>Piercing:</b> This invocation gives the omdura’s allies great focus
      and makes their spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 <em>sacred
      bonus</em> on <em>concentration</em> checks and <em>caster level</em>
      checks to overcome a target’s <em>spell resistance</em>. This bonus
      increases by 1 for every 3 class levels the omdura has.</li>

      <li><b>Protection:</b> The omdura radiates a protective aura, granting a
      +1 <em>sacred bonus</em> to <em>Armor Class</em>. This bonus increases by
      1 for every 5 class levels the omdura has. At 10th level, this bonus is
      doubled against <em>attack rolls</em> to confirm critical hits against the
      omdura’s allies.</li>

      <li><b>Purify:</b> The omdura’s allies are protected from the vile taint
      of her foes, gaining a +1 <em>sacred bonus</em> on all saving throws. This
      bonus increases by 1 for every 5 class levels the omdura has. At 10th
      level, the bonus is doubled against curses, diseases, and poisons.</li>

      <li><b>Resiliency:</b> This invocation makes the omdura’s allies resistant
      to harm, granting <em>DR</em> 1/magic. This <em>DR</em> increases by 1 for
      every 5 class levels the omdura has. At 10th level, this <em>DR</em>
      changes from magic to an <em>alignment</em> (chaotic, evil, good, or
      lawful) that is opposite the omdura’s. If she is neutral, the type of
      <em>DR</em> doesn’t change.</li>

      <li><b>Resistance:</b> The omdura’s allies are shielded by a flickering
      aura, gaining 2 points of <em>energy resistance</em> against one energy
      type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic)chosen when the omdura calls
      this invocation. The protection increases by 2 for every 3 class levels
      the omdura has.</li>

      <li><b>Smiting:</b> This invocation bathes the weapons of the omdura’s
      allies in a divine light. These weapons count as magic for the purpose of
      bypassing <em>damage reduction</em>. At 6th level, the allies’ weapons
      also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the
      purpose of bypassing <em>damage reduction</em>. The type selected must
      match one of the omdura’s alignments. If the omdura is neutral, she does
      not grant this bonus. At 10th level, the allies’ weapons also count as
      <em>adamantine</em> for the purpose of overcoming <em>damage
      reduction</em> (but not for reducing <em>hardness</em>).</li>
