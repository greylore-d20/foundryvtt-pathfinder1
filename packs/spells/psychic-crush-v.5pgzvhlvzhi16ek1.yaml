      <p>This functions as <i>psychic crush IV</i>, but on a successful
      Fortitude or Will save, the target takes 11d6 points of damage + 1 point
      of damage per caster level. If it is at fewer than half its total hit
      points, the target takes a -2 penalty on the Will save to resist this
      spell. This spell can be undercast.</p>
