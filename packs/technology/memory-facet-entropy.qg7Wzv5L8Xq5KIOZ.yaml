      <p>A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb.
      This potent device is used to store programming meant to augment or change
      the nature of how an AI functions. Originally used as a portable method of
      safely transporting and storing the complex code required to program
      artificial intelligences, memory facets can also be used to augment an
      existing AI. Full rules for memory facets can be found on pages 62-63 of
      <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #86: Lords of Rust</em>, including rules for
      aggression facets, ego facets, and inhibitor facets. The new memory facets
      detailed below can be found in "Palace of Fallen
      Stars."</p><p><strong>Entropy Facet</strong>: This memory facet enhances
      an AI's capacity to understand and interpret chaos theory and
      probabilities, allowing it to more swiftly react to and mimic emotions.
      The facet grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the AI's Charisma score. In
      addition, up to three times per day when the AI rolls a d20, it can roll
      twice and take either result as an immediate action. This ability must be
      used after the first roll but before the results are revealed.</p>
