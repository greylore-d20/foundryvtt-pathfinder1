      <p><strong>Source</strong> Black Markets pg. 12</p><p>You can infuse a
      poison with a magical effect.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Brew
      Potion, Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, caster level
      3rd.</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can infuse an ingested poison
      with any spell of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets one or
      more creatures and has a casting time of less than 1 minute. Infusing a
      poison takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less; otherwise,
      infusing a poison takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. When
      you infuse a poison, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to
      cast the spell in question and no higher than your own caster level. To
      infuse a poison, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base
      price.</p><p>When you create an infused poison, you make any choices that
      you would normally make when casting the spell.</p><p>Whoever ingests the
      infused poison is the target of the spell.</p>
