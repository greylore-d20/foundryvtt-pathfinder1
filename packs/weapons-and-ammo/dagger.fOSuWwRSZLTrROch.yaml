  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A dagger is a fighting knife. Its blade is usually less than 1 foot
      long, and can be curved or straight, with one edge or two. Dagger designs
      vary widely, and can have many different names (such as a thrusting dagger
      being called a "dirk"). You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks
      made to conceal a dagger on your body.</p>
