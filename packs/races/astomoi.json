      "value": "<h2>Standard Racial Traits</h2><ul><li><b>Ability Score Modifiers:</b> Astomoi ever pursue enlightenment through self-denial and are psychically attuned to their surroundings, but their delicate bodies are more susceptible to the physical dangers of the world. They gain +2 <em>Intelligence</em> and +2 <em>Wisdom</em> but suffer –2 <em>Constitution</em>.</li><li><b>Size:</b> Astomoi are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li><li><b>Speed:</b> Astomoi have a base speed of 30 feet.</li><li><b>Languages:</b> Astomoi begin play knowing Common, but as they have no mouths, they cannot speak. They have <em>telepathy</em> with a range of 100 feet. Astomoi with high <em>Intelligence</em> scores can choose any of the following languages: Abyssal, Aklo, Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Infernal, and Sylvan.</li></ul><h4>Senses</h4><ul><li><b>Scent:</b> Astomoi have the <em>scent</em> special ability.</li><li><b>Telepathic Senses:</b> Astomoi can't speak or see, but can mentally sense the area within 60 feet, as per <em>darkvision</em>, and can speak telepathically. An astomoi can't see anything beyond 60 feet. An astomoi must provide thought <em>components</em> for spells that normally require verbal <em>components</em>. It can use <em>language-dependent</em> abilities with its <em>telepathy</em>, but not abilities that depend on audible <em>components</em>.</li></ul><h4>Defensive Abilities</h4><ul><li><b>Sensitive Breath:</b> Astomoi take a –2 penalty on saving throws against <em>disease</em> and inhaled poisons.</li></ul><h4>Offensive Abilities</h4><ul><li><b>Mouthless:</b> Astomoi don't need to eat or drink to survive. Instead, they absorb the essence of food and drink; this consumes the nutrients of the meal as though it had been eaten, rendering the food useless to others. Astomoi consume <em>potions</em> and other ingested materials in the same fashion. Since they never actually ingest anything, they can't normally be exposed to ingested poisons.</li></ul>"
