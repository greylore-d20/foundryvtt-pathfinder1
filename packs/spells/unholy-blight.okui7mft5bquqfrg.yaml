  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form
    of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral (not
    evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.</p><p>The spell deals 1d8 points of
    damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per
    caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened
    for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates
    the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by <i>remove disease</i>
    or <i>heal</i>, but <i>remove curse</i> is effective.</p><p>The spell deals
    only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are
    not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to
    one-quarter) with a successful Will save.</p>
