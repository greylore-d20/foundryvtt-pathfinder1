      only.</p><p>Fighting in the mountains of Zi Ha has trained samsaran
      slayers to strike the unwary with deadly attacks from above. If a slayer
      deals sneak attack damage to a creature that is unaware of his presence
      while he is standing on higher ground than his target, he does not have to
      roll sneak attack damage; instead, the sneak attack deals maximum damage.
      The samsaran must be standing on solid ground to use this ability.</p>
