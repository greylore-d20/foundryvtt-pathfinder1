    "shortDescription": "<p>You direct spirits into the shadows of creatures. The shadows of creatures that fail their Will saving throws appear slightly different for the duration of the spell, bearing small horns, unusually long and slender arms, or other small discrepancies. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. At will as an immediate action (but no more often than once every 10 minutes), a <i>mischievous shadow</i> can interfere with its host's actions or the actions of adjacent creatures by interacting with their shadows in ways that affect their physical counterparts, such as grabbing the shadow of a crossbow to redirect the physical weapon's aim. Each disruption either imposes a -8 penalty on a single attack roll, combat maneuver check, or Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, or requires a spellcaster to succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) or lose a spell being cast. If you are within range of the spell effect, you can decide how these shadows interfere; otherwise, their actions are timed and decided by the GM as needed, typically manifesting during important or crucial roles. Each time a <i>mischievous shadow</i> makes such a disruption, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.</p>",
