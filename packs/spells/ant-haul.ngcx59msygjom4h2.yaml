      <p>The target's carrying capacity triples (see Table 7-4: Carrying
      Capacity on page 171 of the Core Rulebook). This does not affect the
      creature's actual Strength in any way, merely the amount of material it
      can carry while benefiting from this spell. It also has no effect on
      encumbrance due to armor. If the creature wears armor it still takes the
      normal penalties for doing so regardless of how much weight the spell
      allows it to carry.</p>
