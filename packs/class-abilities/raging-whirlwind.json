      "value": "<p>The barbarian can create a whirlwind with a powerful spinning move as an immediate action after she confirms a critical hit with a melee attack. The whirlwind circles the target of her melee attack, lifting it in the air slightly until the end of the barbarian’s turn. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier) to negate this effect. If it fails the save, the target loses its Dexterity modifier to AC for the rest of the barbarian’s turn and lands prone on the ground at the end of her turn. Raging whirlwind has no effect on flying creatures.</p>\n<p>A barbarian must be at least 12th level to choose this rage power.</p>"
