      <p>This outfit consists of fitted pants, a shirt, a hooded reversible
      cloak, soft leather boots, and a face <em>mask</em>, all in dark or
      neutral colors. The outfit's few buttons and rivets are wrapped in dull,
      dark cloth to avoid jingling or reflecting light. A number of loops and
      shallow pockets are also worked into the outfit, providing ample spaces
      for stashing small tools or weapons.</p>
