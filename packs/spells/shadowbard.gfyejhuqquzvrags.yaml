  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You conjure up a quasi-real phantom singer that is visible as a
      shifting, shadowy duplicate of yourself. The singer follows you
      automatically, moving as you move even if you teleport.</p><p>The singer
      cannot be damaged, but can be dispelled. When a <i>shadowbard</i> comes
      into being, it immediately begins a bardic performance of your choice-it
      has access to all of the bardic performances that you do. It continues
      that bardic performance until you direct it as a move action to switch to
      a different performance. Rounds spent by a <i>shadowbard</i> creating a
      bardic performance do not decrease the number of rounds you can use your
      own bardic performance, nor can a <i>shadowbard</i>'s bardic performance
      be used to trigger spells that require you to begin or cease a bardic
      performance.</p>
