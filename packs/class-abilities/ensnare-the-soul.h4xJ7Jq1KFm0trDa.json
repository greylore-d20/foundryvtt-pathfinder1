Add @Compendium[pf1.spells.tjog6bufg5b08lvq]{Charm Person} and @Compendium[pf1.spells.q070n0zoq3zojpas]{Dominate Person} to your spell list. Creatures affected by either spell become listless and pale, appearing dead to observers (DC 20 Heal or Perception check to determine the creature is not undead). Affected creatures are slow to take any action unless you specifically direct them to do so. They are not mindless or helpless, however, and defend themselves if attacked.</p>"
