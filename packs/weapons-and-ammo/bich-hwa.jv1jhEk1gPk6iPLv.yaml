  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Also known as the waveblade or "scorpion's tail," this short,
      double-curved blade has no hilt but features a knuckle guard and can
      easily be used in either hand. A bich'hwa provides a +2 bonus on any roll
      made to keep from being disarmed in combat. This weapon is a special monk
      weapon for the use of flurry of blows and other monk abilities.</p>
