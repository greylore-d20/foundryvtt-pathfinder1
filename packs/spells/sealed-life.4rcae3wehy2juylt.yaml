  shortDescription: >-
    <p>You seal the life force within the target, preventing it from sharing its
    vitality with others. Affected creatures can't transfer damage to or from
    another, such as through <i>shield other</i>, a spiritualist's life bond, or
    a summoner's life link. Effects such as <i>vampiric touch</i> that steal
    vitality from others deal damage normally, but provide no benefits.</p>
