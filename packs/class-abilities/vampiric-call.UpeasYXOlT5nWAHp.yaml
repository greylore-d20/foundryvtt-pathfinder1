  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The vampire hunter summons base creatures of the night—bats, rats,
      insects, and the like—to swarm around him. These creatures provide a
      measure of defense against damage, granting the vampire hunter a number of
      <em>temporary hit points</em> equal to his level. At 8th level, he also
      gains a +2 <em>deflection bonus</em> to AC. At 16th level, the
      <em>deflection bonus</em> increases to +4.</p>
