      <p>This spell functions like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.oylikodnyku2zewu]{invisibility}, except
      that the effect moves with the group and is broken when anyone in the
      group attacks.</p><p>Individuals in the group cannot see each other. The
      spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the
      nearest member of the group. If only two individuals are affected, the one
      moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving
      away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between
      them exceeds 180 feet.</p>
