Used by bureaucrats, diplomats, and clerks, it's also useful for counterfeiting official correspondence. It provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks when dealing with city officials and a +2 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks when creating forgeries. A book of letters is only accurate for a particular region, such as a country or even a town, and only provides its bonus relating to that region. <b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs.</p>\r\n"
