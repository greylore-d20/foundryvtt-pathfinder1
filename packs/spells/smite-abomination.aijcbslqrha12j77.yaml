  shortDescription: >-
    <p>Drawing upon positive energy, you emulate some of a paladin's power to
    smite undead. Choose one undead creature as your target.</p><p>Your melee
    attacks against that target gain a bonus equal to your Charisma or Wisdom
    modifier, whichever is higher, on your attack rolls, and a bonus equal to
    your caster level on damage rolls. Your melee attacks also bypass the
    target's damage reduction. These bonuses do not stack with the bonuses from
    a paladin's smite.</p>
