    value: >-
      <p>Calling down a litany of anathema, you make an evil more susceptible to
      the attacks of good creatures. If the target is evil, it takes double
      damage from attacks made by creatures with a good aura (from a class
      feature or as a creature with the good subtype). If the target also has
      the evil subtype; when it is hit with attacks made by creatures with a
      good aura, it is also dazzled for 1d4 rounds. If this spell targets a
      nonevil creature (or one that lacks the evil subtype), it has no effect,
      and the spell is wasted.  While subject to this spell, the target cannot
      be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the
      title.</p>
