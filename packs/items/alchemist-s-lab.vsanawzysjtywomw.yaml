      <p>This lab is used for making alchemical items, and provides a +2
      circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the
      costs related to the Craft (alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character
      with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the
      skill but not enough to get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.</p>
