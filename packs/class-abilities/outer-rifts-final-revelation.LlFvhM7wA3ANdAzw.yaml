    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you gain the ability to open rifts between planes. This
      allows you to use @Compendium[pf1.spells.ursm11405zobemi3]{Gate} as a
      spell-like ability once per day. If you use this ability to call
      creatures, you still need to provide 10,000 gp in offerings to secure the
      creatureâ€™s aid.</p>
